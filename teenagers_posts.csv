Title: how should i feel,
"Selftext: i was at a party a week ago, and i was standing outside for some air when a guy approached me to ask if i was alright. we chatted for a while and it got sort of deep and he asked for my snap before we went back inside. before i left, he came and walked out with me, and we’ve been messaging non stop ever since. i get attached quite easily, and i already am to him and he said he was to me as well. we fit each others types and convo just flows really easily between us and he’s also complimented me a lot. i’m seeing him again in a week with my friends, and i feel like something could maybe happen with us, but i don’t want to get ahead of myself or mistake him being platonic with something more than that. what should i do?",

Title: Im I in the wrong for breaking up with my girlfriend cause she changed ,
"Selftext: First of all we’ve been dating for three inconsistent years, it was all sweet in the beginning. She always listened to me cared for me and my feelings and avoided doing stuff that’ll hurt me. But in the last few months when ever we argue it seems like she doesn’t give a fuck if she was wrong, she always put the blame on me even when she’s wrong, she stopped caring about what makes me mad and jealous. Like simping for male celebrities and saying it was normal even tho she accepted not to in the past. She stopped responding immediately, stopped making me her priority like she did before, always postpone our dates for stupid reasons and for an average 3 postpones a date. and always complain about that i dont treat her very well even while she act like shit. And forgot to mention that all the effort that’s been put into the relationship was from me.  I couldn’t handle anymore, I was being patient hoping that the old her would summon but unfortunately it didn’t after all the effort I put. So I broke up with her. Did I made the right decision ?",

Because it was such a short lived thing I haven't really caught any feelings but it still hurts a little bit atleast if we could've finished the conversation and mutually moved on I would've been fine but the lack of closure just keeps making me insecure maybe I wasn't that interesting to him even though he approached me first.,

"Selftext: What’s with this whole speculation about females being the “confusing” ones in a relationship or females being responsible for sending “mixed signals”? Truly speaking, anyone who has been in a relationship or anything of the sorts would have come to realise it is the males who are unclear in their actions and bipolar in behaviour! If anything, the females are the ones who always have to be straightforward and clear yet the males who can’t catch onto (clear) social cues are the ones saying “Women are confusing.” Why are males so difficult?

"What has me concerned is she ist texted me before I woke up (we have a 5h time difference) and she texted me lots of love texts (as in she said all she loves about me and stuff) and now she is gone and has been for 6h, this has never happened before and I am really concerned so let’s go over the options:",
1: her mother left for a while and should be back at some point which would mean she would text me anywhere in the next 1-5h,
"2: other internet problems, she will do anything in her power to text me I know her and she will do that without thinking twice ",
(These are the most likely but ofc my stupid fucking overthinking brain got a couple other ideas that are unlikely but still concern me because of course),
"- she ghosted me (unlikely, I know her)",
"- her phone broke down (unlikely, we have the exact same model and mine doesn’t have any issues)",
- she got into an accident and is injured (I hate my mind for coming up with this because it almost had me crying in class),

Idk alot of the rappers also just don't seem like they even have staying power and won't be remembered in the next 5 years. They all sound the same with that annoying tick tick that you can hear in arrest suck as playboy carty and Travis Scott ",

Title: My Parents Got Me Fired.,
Selftext: My Parents Got Me Fired.,
TLDR: my parents got me fired from a job I got by myself to pay for my fees in HS and now I don’t know what to do.,
"(M 17) For several years, my parents told me that I couldn’t get a job until I was in my junior year. Yet, for several years, anytime I needed help with funds (honor society fees, band tuition, school trip fees, etc) they would always fall short. I would always have to talk to my teachers and ask for extensions on just about everything that included money. To be clear, both of my parents are fairly successful and make nearly 6 figures a year each. So when I finally had the opportunity to get a job, I was immediately faced with opposition in the form of lies and manipulative statements. “Are you sure you want to work? You’re already tired as it is”; “we’re going to pay for your fees this time, so don’t worry about it”; “If you work, you’ll have to walk there. That’s a waste of my gas to drive you 5 miles a day picking you up and dropping you off”.",
"I had figured out the logistics long before applying, and told them I agree to their terms so that I can start working. I set up several interviews over the entirety of the school year — making sure I asked what day my parents were available to drop me off, letting them know when and where it is, and how long it’s supposed to take. They would agree to yet somehow miss every single one, each time coming up with a reason why I shouldn’t be applying. So I walked to my last interview (7 miles away), got hired and walked back home to get started on the set up for orientation.",
"My parents refused to give me my information to apply, so I had to use my resources to find or remember it. Once officially hired, I received a schedule of 3-11 for Wednesday-Sunday. Having to walk there and back for every shift, and most of the work being in the middle of the school week, I had been very tired during the week. They immediately pointed this out and offered I quit the job “for my well-being”. I ignore this comment and continue working. I complete the week and am given some time off so that I could officially be out of the schedule, but my parents took this as me “slacking” and asked why I’m not working if I wanted a job.",
"After about a month, I was hanging out with my longtime friend when our shift ended. She was planning to take me home as she had done the last time we got off at the same time, but this time my parents were mad because they went to pick me up and I wasn’t there. Keep in mind they never attempted to pick me up any other day. So my dad decides to “fire” me and takes my phone “because I’m always on it” (although, ironically I have a screen time notification reading 4 hours average).",
"3 weeks pass and I figure it fired, so I head up to collect my final check. Turned out I was still on the schedule for that day. My parents reluctantly gave me the job back, and I explained everything to my manager. She basically told me the same things I was telling my parents: they weren’t there for the application nor onboarding process, so they can’t fire me; I needed the phone to see my schedule; i needed to be able to call out if I couldn’t show up for a shift.",
"The very next Sunday, my mom says I can’t go to work, so I ask if I can call out instead of just not showing up. She says no and this becomes the last straw for the owner. I worked every day for the next two weeks to find out I had been terminated because of the no call no show on that Sunday. ",
"Most of my fees are due in august, so if I can’t come up with $600 dollars by then I don’t know what will happen for my future. ",
TLDR: my parents got me fired from a job I got by myself to pay for my fees in HS and now I don’t know what to do.,

"for the last couple of years i can’t really stop thinking about her. it felt like that was the last genuine connection i had with somebody. i miss talking to her, i miss matching energy, i always wonder if she’s okay. we had classes together but i felt like some days i could feel her presence trying to talk to me being across the room.",
"we randomly text here and there. we haven’t done this in roughly 2 years. she told me that she had a dream with me in it and i’ve had dreams with her in it cause i miss her. i don’t have any romantic feelings, i just love her in a different way.",
"i would really hope if she would feel the same way because i think about how different times were back then. it also didn’t help that people shipped me and her together because our faces match. i’m not lonely irl, i feel emotionally lonely. it felt like she depended on me to be there and i miss it.",

Title: Help improving myself,
"Selftext: TLDR: I am struggling with depression, and I wanted to ask some of you all how I can improve myself to A. Be more attractive, and B. Feel better about myself.",
"I’m a freshman in high school. And for the past year or so, I’ve been struggling with mental health problems. And I genuinely don’t know how to improve myself. I tried getting help, but I didn’t notice a difference. This all kind of noticeably started when I tried to ask someone out. I got rejected. No big deal, right? Well, the next week, I attended a school dance. I had fun with my friends, and then I wanted to redeem myself by asking someone to dance. I got turned down three times that day. It hit me hard, because not even being able to get a dance is just sad. I got to thinking after that time on what I could’ve been doing wrong. Which, this did not help whatsoever. It just reminded me. After that time, there was a stretch of about two or three months riddled with self-harm. After that time passed, I ended up finding someone else that I liked. I tried to shoot my shot after getting the courage to try again. My self esteem was low already, and when I asked, I got rejected. Again. I was absolutely devastated. So started a time (up until now) of intense mental torment. I legitimately have zero self confidence right now. And that’s where you all come in. I want to ask you all what I can do to improve myself to get myself the upper hand when it comes to dating, as well as smile at myself in the mirror (without forcing it). Anyways, sorry for keeping you guys here reading my paragraph, thank y’all!",

"Title: The first page of my book, it's all just ramblings and random spontaneous ideas.",
"Selftext: I assume you're here just to hear some idiot ramble on, hell, that's what the title says. I’m not one to break a promise so, you're gonna get some idiotic ramblings. Let's start with what song I’m listening to. I am currently listening to Hot Rails to Hell by Blue Öyster Cult. I honestly hate that most of their fame comes from the stupid cowbell skit. Listen to their first three albums, and tell me those aren’t peak. Oh damn, the song is ending, I thought I would’ve written more than that. Oh well, we’re on another BÖC song, it’s called The Red & the Black, I quite like it. To be completely honest, I like basically all forms of music, as long as there’s heart put into it, that’s why I like older music. Sure, you can make millions by mumbling nonsense into a microphone to the most generic beat known to man, but where’s the fun in that? I’m not against rap either, I personally love the new stuff Kendrick has put out, plus almost all the classics have a certain charming “DIY” feel with the messily looped samples from old motown songs as beats that you can’t help but love. Honestly I’m probably only gonna finish one page tonight, it’s 2:40 currently, and I’m delirious. Oh well, I gotta finish the page though. In the time that sentence was written I listened to Divine Wind by BÖC, it was good, nice 6/8 groove. It’s repetitious, but that kinda works for the song. Maybe I should listen to someone else after this song (Deadline, by - you already know who) actually, I kinda want to listen to Lips in the Hills first. I promised other topics on the cover of this book, but for now on this page, imma talk about music. Music is kind of an anomaly when you think about it. Over the past few thousand, million, or however many years we’ve been around, we’ve found a way to make sounds pleasant to the human ears, which were mainly meant for communication and alerting the brain of any suspicious sounds that invoke danger. That’s honestly fascinating to me. We as a species can really come up with unique things when we put our minds to it, we aren’t bound by mental limitations like other animals, or pre-built mental formulas of how things are supposed to be. Honestly, if we can get the idea of a working formula out of the music industry, pop music nowadays wouldn’t be so damn BORING I swear, every single Taylor Swift song sounds the same to me, it's always something along the lines of “Oh I broke up with my boyfriend I’m so sad, even though I’ve done this 90 times before!” Why the hell can’t she do something unique? Something different? She has the whole world’s ears, she just needs to fire her large team of pop music writers and start making what she likes. A counterargument to this would be “oh she makes a ton of money off the working formula, why would she stop?” And honestly, that's a damn good point, I just want to see some creativity coming from her end. Speaking of songs about breaking up with people, I’m gonna ramble about relationships some. I’ve personally only dated one person, and it was pretty damn bad, she was so damn HYPER. My half asleep laid back brain could not comprehend what the hell was going on every 2 seconds. She would get pissed at me for something small and random that happened a few weeks prior, for example, I didn’t smile in a picture (I never do, I hate my face) and she got so damn pissed at me. Maybe that’s how women are, I don’t know, I’m not one. I only plan on dating women so maybe I’ll learn their “secrets” although I doubt it. To be completely honest, I might not date anyone at all. To be completely honest, I have trouble getting along with people in a relationship that’s bigger than friendship. I wish I had better conversational skills, because I can only talk to women in a joking manner, never anything serious.",
Title: couldn’t graduate hs because of my brain tumor,
Selftext: warning: i am a horrible storyteller and rambler. this is VERY incoherent.,
"i couldnt walk at my hs graduation because of one class. i worked for 12 years for what?? ive always been a mediocre student, c average, my attendance was pretty bad after covid due to anxiety from bullying and other factors but during my junior year it got pretty bad, i had been going to so many different doctors appointments for mysterious illnesses, but was later just told i had a pituitary adenoma (brain tumor) and ibs… i was diagnosed with the tumor almost halfway through my senior year. it was great to finally have answers after so many years but there were still so many tests, appointments, questions, fears, that came along. the anxiety got worse, the appointments got more frequent and the attendance got worse. ",
"fin lit had just started to be required at my school during my junior year but was only available during the second semester, which caused me to have to take it my senior second semester. this was a horrible time for me. the class was in the morning. the worst time for someone with a lot of dt appointments. i probably missed almost half of that class though out the year. this was already a super difficult class with everyone i know having a low b at highest. i tried to get the online assignments i could done but with the lack of info on google classroom it was so confusing. and no once else would help me. this teacher had very obvious favorites and since i wasnt very extroverted and seemed to be skipping his class, he didnt like me. he once outed me and scoffed at me when i exclaimed at how confused i was by saying “youre never here anyways” and i was so taken aback that i didnt say anything. i still dont understand why he would dig at me for that when it showed in my attendance that my tardiness and absences were usually EXCUSED for fucking DR APPTS! he saw i was out for a valid reason but ignored it. my grade continued to plumet and i had only noticed when it was too late, my grades were put in the gradebook far after i could do anything about it and many of the assignments were on paper that i was NEVER told about. i understand that i shouldve advocated for myself but i had already felt so ignored. ",
"as a senior theres so many new and different things you have to pay for: cap and gown (120), gown photos (40), yard sign (30), yearbook (110) to ship to your house, other school fees (mine were 220), grad ceremony tickets (10) but i planned for 8 family members to come, 2 plane tickets for my family to see me graduate (320 x2), senior photos (80) sports banner (30). all of this had to be purchased far before graduation and far before i started to fail my class. (some of these things are not necessary to graduate but my family wanted to show their support and most other students’ families felt the same about their grads) ",
"most teachers are always behind on their student’s grades and so was mine but i never expected what was next. at the time there was a week left until grading ended, we still had exams and i still had time to catch up. i had a 40% in that class which was the worst of all of my classes (c-bs in those) and i got called down to the office. i was told i had “NO chance of passing fin lit and walking at graduation”. as i was sitting in my principals office, holding back my vigorous tears, my principal decided to call my mother in front of me.. he called her and told her, on speaker, “…op cannot walk at graduation due to failing said class…” and i could hear the shock and disappointment in my mother. it was humiliating. theres no was he wasnt getting some sadistic satisfaction out of this. tears were silently streaming down my face as i tried to keep my composure. everything was blurry from the tears but i silently walked out of his office and went straight to the restroom, i sobbed my eyes out very audibly and tried to not fully flip out. i was so angry at myself but so angry at the lack of help i had. ",
a WEEK before graduation?,
they couldnt have asked me if i needed help?,
they could reach out?,
"if was just a “no, youre out”???",
they werent “sorry”. they didnt care.,
"i was told i could still get my diploma, AFTER summer school… but i could go to the ceremony and walk… i had done summer school in the past due to covid and knew i could complete the online course in a single day, yes, a single day. so i asked my counselor if i could just take the class before school ended and still walk but i was told no.. ",
i had to then explain to my entire family that i had dissapointed them and wasted so much of their money. i still feel so much guilt but after much comfort i feel a bit better. ,
"i was not the only person to not be able to walk due to this class, there were SIX other people… SIX FOR THIS ONE CLASS! i go to a small school so this was extremely abnormal. and i actually knew another student who was in a worse situation than me with this class. she was HOMELESS and and STOMACH CANCER- so she was out with dr appts as well and had no help from this teacher or school faculty. ",
when grad day came around i was sulking in my bed watching the live stream from my room. ,
when summer school came around i of course attended. i started on my online fin lit and completed the entire class in FOUR HOURS!!!!! i wasted 12 YEARS of my life for a FOUR HOUR CLASS!! I TOLD THEM i could complete it quick and they didnt let me. since i had finished it i didnt have to attend summer school for the rest of the time. my mom literally got a call from the school asking why i wasnt showing up and when she said i finished the class the first day they were in disbelief- ,
"they then told my i could come pick up my diploma whenever i was available but i have gone to the school twice not and told to once, come back a later day, and two, email my principal asking when a good time to pick it up would be. i have called four times with no response and emailed my principal with no response. i plan to try and go back on monday but have my doubts. but my anxious ass of course is scared theyre witholding it from me and mi really need it before im move away in two weeks. ",
im trying to move on and look past all of that now. and i really thank you if you listened to me horribly ramble. :),

We should practice kissing each other. “It won’t be gay cuz we don’t like each other” so basically we all started making out and we learned how to kiss and our dates went perfectly smooth and the girls have no idea we kissed. This isn’t gay right? ,

Title: I need help,
Selftext: Yap sesh incoming,
"I’m a dude who goes to an all boys highschool. I really can only get into talking stages with girls. I’m extremely underconfident, and try to make up for my lost confidence with a good sense of humor and loudness. My own looks generally repulse me, and I believe every time someone compliments me it is a forced and strangled one. I’ve only ever truly been in love once, with whom I’ve pushed away with my own selfishness and narcissism. My parents constantly wonder where their cheery beautiful son has gone.",
"I’ve been led on several times, and I just want a connection to somebody that can love me as i want to love them. However, it's really hard for me to talk to girls because i go to an all boys school. at some point i downloaded wizz (basically a dating app for teens to those who dont know) (very new low) to a minimal sucess on there too.",

",
"this had caused me so much stress and feeling like im just not good enough, and so i stopped being all that affectionate with him like a month ago because every time i just was thinking about how im not good enough at it. i kinda dont feel attracted to him as much anymore either? like hes been in europe for a couple weeks so that might be part of it and weve been dating a while so maybe were just not in the honeymoon phase anymore but i cant think about sex with him without thinking about how stressful it is to try and do something he will like. i dont really like kissing him anymore, and i always kinda subconsciously pull away and i dont initiate it anymore. we will cuddle and stuff and thats fine but his comments have made it so hard even to think about sex stuff on my own time because it clouds my brain with worry.",

Title: how should i have reacted to my bestfriend cutting me out,
"Selftext: okay so my bestfriend of over 6 years and i stopped talking a few months ago. i am basically over it now but wanted to get some other teen opinions on the whole situation and how i reacted. so the story goes that me and her were super close, like her family basically took me in as their child close. the last time i entered her house was for her birthday sleepover, where we hung out in our small group. after our sophomore year started, things got weird. she started to text less and be more distant, which wasn't super odd cause our friendship wasn't high maintenance like that. however, she started hanging with new friends, and any attempts i made to hang with her were shut down, with her saying she's busy. now, i have other friends too, but i make sure to make time for all my friends i have. a friend of mine overheard her at one point telling her new group that she used to have just me, but now she has all of them, and basically making it out that our friendship wasn't fulfilling. i was caught off guard cause i never tried to make her feel she just had to hang out with me or anything of the sorts, and it hurt me cause it made me think i wasn't enough of a friend for her. the cherry on top was when she was taking me home one day from school she said she lied to a guy saying she was busy a lot so she didn't have to hang out with him, when in reality she hasn't even been busy that much. i just sat there staring ahead cause i realized she had been saying the same thing to me, and i had been desperately trying to see her, my BEST FRIEND. i let her become close with her other friends, cried a lot, and finally grew the balls to text her asking her if we were okay. i basically wrote a whole paragraph asking if i did anything wrong and how i really miss us and didn't want to lose her, and she responded saying its just something that happens during high school and someone did this to her last year so she didn't want to make me feel that way. it didn't make me feel better at all, but i let it be. my parents started to grow confused and after not telling them what was going on i finally broke down and told them what happened. at no point did i get mad at her, but i feel like i still have a hole in my chest and she seems completely fine.",
"also, if this is even relevant, the only other time we've had a distance or ""fight"" was a year and a half ago. she started getting distant, i asked her what was wrong, and she told me i had changed as a person and become meaner, and other people were noticing it too. i was going through a really hard time mentally and i apologized, but i didn't recall being mean to her or anyone, although i probably was if people were noticing it. i remember i was on a road trip and had to silently cry in the car cause i was so pent up with emotions. i felt really alone, but we ended up making up and i told her i would change. my memory is foggy but thats basically what happened.",
"she really is so sweet and i love her as a bestfriend. we were like identical twins with how similar we were and months later i still feel so empty after losing her. this post doesn't cover our amazing memories, and there are a lot. i honestly just wanted to share the story and see what others have to say. i appreciate feedback, but please be nice as there are no villains in this situation, just two different perspectives.",

Title: Sleep Cycle,
"Selftext: I feel overwhelmed with everything; so overwhelmed that I want to just shut down, go to sleep, and never wake up--to be alive only in my dreams. I find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed each morning. After I wake, I find wisps of dream-worlds still alive in my mind, luring me back to sleep for another hour, then two hours, only with the goal to distract myself further from reality. I find myself with a greater disconnect to the real world each afternoon. I close my eyes tight shut for a few seconds, then open them to only find disappointment. In the evenings, when I peer through my blinds to see another setting sun, I gain an exponential yearn for sleep. A yearning for complete darkness--complete loneliness. This yearning carries into the few dark hours before I crawl into bed, still as awake as I was when I left it earlier that day. Although, as much as I crave succumbing to my dreams, I still find it difficult to sleep. I've grown tired of tiredness; I've had to learn to live a life without it. And even when I do fall asleep, I have mostly nightmares, but those nightmares--as haunting and excruciating as they can be--are still more desirable than real life, and only for one reason. Even in nightmares, I can still wake up and dream up a new one; change up my reality in a matter of seconds (or, what seems like seconds). Even after particularly frightening nightmares that leave me sweat-ridden and bleary-eyed, I can still drift back to sleep, alive in a new world, a different world that I can exist in without a permanent care.  I dream of dreams in my waking hours, but in those hours I dream of nothing, for all of my dreams have already come true. ",

Title: My brother can never take a joke. It's infuriating.,
"Selftext: I have a younger brother (14) who can never seem to take a joke. Almost every joke he makes is at the expense of others yet when another person makes fun of him it's suddenly not funny. He does this thing where he'll make this atrocious fake laugh in response to anything thrown at him. I laughed at it once or twice and I guess that gave him the confidence to keep it rolling. Other times he’ll blatantly just say “That's not funny”. There was one encounter about a week ago where he made a joke about my younger cousin. He said, “You’re so fat I can feel your footsteps from upstairs”. I really hate when he and my other cousins make fun of their younger sisters' weight not just because their totally average but because they're young girls and seemingly internalize it. One of the girls said she didn't want another helping of food because she was fat. Anyways, I responded, “We can't hear yours because your legs are too heavy to lift off the ground, you just shuffle”. It was immature but too funny to let go and I knew it would also make my younger cousin laugh. My brother got this dead pane stare and in fashion said: “That wasn't funny”.",
"I think he's like this because he's insecure about himself as a guy. He likes to pick on other kids at school and sucks up to the popular ones. He especially has no problem picking on girls he thinks are losers or social outcasts. Which I think speaks for itself. He's also the type to repost videos about some guy wearing pink or something, a caption with: “The gays are ruining this generation” and a cut to a nature clip and sad music (iykyk). It's a bit ironic since all he does is sit on the couch for 12 hours a day playing Fortnite and watching YouTube shorts but I digress. Another detail is that he’s kinda short and hasn't seemed to hit puberty yet so he stands out among his peers. He is also insanely vindictive when it comes to being corrected by anyone. My parents say he’ll grow out of it but it's not looking like it. I try to comfort myself with the thought though.",

"Selftext: Probably shouldn’t be saying this as my friends stalk me online, but idc anymore. This girl I’ve known for a few years and was in my class started to look more and more attractive, until basically I was happy Everytime I saw her. Still am. But as I got closer, I couldn’t tell if she was flirting or was just my friend. It wasn’t very obvious. I was gonna ask her out, but I needed the right time to see if she actually liked me or if she was just nice to me specifically. Didn’t wanna ruin the friendship we already had, asking a friend out is hard. Next thing you know, as I’m on the verge of asking her out, she gets a bf. Some tall dude who’s barely a guy. I’m not angry at him or her. I’m angry at me. I probably should have seen this coming. And falling for a friend doesn’t usually end well. But finding out she still treats me the same, she’s just nice. Means we were just friends the whole time. And here I thought she liked me. Pretty stupid. Don’t feel super great. I was dumb to want something, maybe a wife someday. Nope",

"But to get started, a month ago my boyfriend left for the Navy. I started having issues with my grandparents regarding the fact that “I never held up to my responsibilities.” That being said, once he left I showed that I could do what needed to be done around the house and outside. The one thing I really struggled with was regulating my emotions— Most teenagers do after all. Though, my 68 year old grandparents couldn’t quite understand that when I tried to explain it to them. After weeks of on and off fighting, me trying my hardest to prove that I wasn’t just some useless kid, and getting a job— They finally caved and kicked me out. My grandmother got very physical with me earlier, the details are not important though it is safe to know the cops were involved (not that they aided much, they honestly worsened things). I’m just at a loss for words.. How in the world is a teenagers mouth supposed to be countered by abuse and controlling habits? They completely took away my ability to come into contact with my boyfriend and his mother. The only two people I have really had recently. Thankfully though, I was able to be pulled from the house by her and a friend of ours. ",

The thing is he has a habit of causing too much BS to happen. He’s threatening kids and peer pressuring them to fight him (he’s one of the strongest kids in school btw) knowing he’ll win cuz the guys at my school are stupid. He causes so much trouble for the teachers to the point where he almost got one of the good teachers (almost everyone at school likes him) fired or arrested because he made up some lie about him assaulting him to the principal. Secondly, for some stupid reason the teachers all seem the like him for god knows what. Also he acts like a gangster and sags his pants (walks a little weird and throws gang signs, but not underwear showing luckily) Third, I’ve noticed an uptake in guys trying to act like him (basically try to be gangster, but failing because they damn well aren’t and have loving and supportive parental figures). AND, the guy comes from a good home with two loving parents that support him. I don’t know why almost everyone at my school respects and loves this guy while he’s the most violent kid I’ve ever seen at my school who literally threatens kids for the stupidest things imaginable. He has a girlfriend that definitely knows all this which makes me feel ridiculous how this is possible to withese.",

Title: FOMO (?) with my friends,
Selftext: Hello everyone.,
"My friends and I (5 in total) are very close-knit and consider each other family. We recently had a get-together to say farewell to those of us who were going very far away to go to college. We had some cold definitely-family-friendly beverages and sat on the couch, talking about our memories with each other. Eventually, the conversation went to our childhood memories with one another (how we met, crazy stories, etc.).",
"However, I found myself unable to talk about anything. I was a late addition to the group, meeting them in sophomore year of high school, where they had all met each other in elementary or early middle school. I grew up in California until 6th grade (12 years old) and moved to the Midwest.",
"I struggled to make friends and became an outcast, associating with bad people (not of my own volition, there was just nobody else who would want to hang out with me). I repressed a lot of my memories in middle school and couldn't recall much about it. I did share my middle school with them, but I couldn't even talk about drama that occurred there because of the repression 😞. ",
"So, I went silent and absorbed my friends' lore, as they talked for hours of fun and crazy times that they shared. I felt this profound form of sadness, or longing, that I wished I could have shared my experiences with them, that I could have met them at the same time as they had met each other, but alas.",
"Most of my childhood memories were not fond, but those good ones I did have were not related to anyone in the friend group at all, and I sustained some psychic damage for not being able to relate to them. We've got a joke that my empathic abilities are to the point of debilitation, but it really is at that point.",
"I know this is marked as advice, but I'm not really looking for advice, I think. I just wanted to share this story and my feelings about it. I suppose, if I am to ask for advice, should I just randomly tell them that I feel sorry for not knowing them sooner? Should I be sad about this in the first place? What are your experiences with this? ",

Title: Love and Drugs,
"Selftext: A girl started following me, and I kept an eye on her. She sent me a casual message, and I replied. After a brief conversation, she showed interest in my music, and we ended up talking for a few days. ",
"She's 19 (I'm 18) and I never imagined having a relationship with her. She was very pretty, but nothing else attracted me. I never imagined a relationship with her; she seemed like the type of girl who spends her life at raves, on TikTok, and doesn't have big ambitions besides doing drugs and thinking she's in a literal romance or some American series. ",
"But one meeting led to another, and we started liking each other, though her feelings were much stronger than mine. I started to like the chaos in her mind and then I fell in love.",
"I thought it made sense to ask her to be my girlfriend, so I took the perfect opportunity: sunset, a song she liked, we were hugging... But when I asked, she started crying and said she wasn't ready for that. She explained that she really liked me, but was afraid it would go wrong or worsen her problems. I respected her feelings.",
"That same night, in the early morning, she called me. Seeing I was with friends, she just talked a bit and asked me to call her later.",
"When I got home, I called her, and she told me that after being with me, she had used too much drugs at a rave (she snorts 3MMC and MDMA in crystal form, only at raves) and, feeling out of it and pressured, kissed a guy, who happened to be my friend. I know him and know he can be persistent. She said she told him she was seeing someone, but he continued, and she felt that kissing him would make him leave her alone.",
"Upon hearing this, I gave her an ultimatum. Either she stops using those drugs and we get serious, or she continues her life, and I continue mine. I don't want to forbid her, but I'm a super chill guy and don't like these kinds of dramas.",
"She agreed and cried with me on the phone all night, saying she really wanted to stop and was sorry. The next day, I resolved everything, understood the other guy's side better, and moved on, believing she would change.",
"But a week later, she told me she wanted to have fun this summer and really wanted to go to raves (which I never had a problem with) and use drugs there. She wanted to know if I was okay with it. I calmly and rationally explained how stupid it was and that it already went wrong once. She said that was an isolated incident, that she learned her lesson, and would control the amount she used and stop with 3MMC, ""only"" snorting MDMA.",
"I ended up giving in, afraid of being a controlling boyfriend. Some time passed, and she's still in this mode. Even though there haven't been more incidents (that I know of), she's visibly more affected psychologically, and I feel it's due to the drug use.",
"Anyway, I just want her to be well, and whenever I bring up the subject, she gets irritated. I don't know what to do, and I feel that by liking her, I can't let her continue with the self-destruction because I feel she's not fully aware of the harms, making it not a 100% conscious decision. She only lives in this little world because it’s where she found an escape from her mind. I see her as a victim of circumstances.",
"I've been thinking of ways to solve this because with me, she's an incredible girl, and I really like her despite everything. The raves she goes to aren't even legal and are just in abandoned houses and places like that. I even considered notifying the police, and thus the rave would be stopped, but that affects people who have nothing to do with my situation. But I really want to do the best possible since talking doesn't help.",

Title: This is something that I believe is important to discuss.,
"Selftext: For a while now, I've been a bit anxious about the future of the USA, which is where I live. It mainly stems from what I see on social media from people in the USA and the crime rates here and the way the government is nowadays and all of the other stuff that goes on. It wasn't until lately that I watched the presidential debate and I realize that we're not only just fucked, but we're cooked because of what went on there. Not only that, but since I am turning 18 soon and will be the legal age of an adult, then I am even more worried because that means I am going to move out soon and live on my own and.. I just feel as if I wont make it in this country!",
Am I alone in this or are other teens afraid of what the USA will become? It doesn't matter if you live in the USA or not because you can live outside of the USA and still be worried or scared about what it'll become. I'm just wondering if anyone else besides me is afraid or worried about the future of the country.,

Title: Update on last post.,
"Selftext: You guys who responded to my last post are right. I am just gay. This whole time what I've felt for boys is what I should've been feeling for girls and I didn't even realize it. Straight people don't feel like I do. I think I've always known that, deep down. That I was different. I'm not meant to feel like this, but I do, and I think that Nathan knows as well. Yesterday and today he started heavily flirting, and the worst part is that I didn't stop him. I didn't tell him I was taken or that I didn't like guys. I think it's because I did want him to say things like that to me. Not because I was taking what he was saying with a grain of salt or that I was too embarrassed to, I wanted him to. Everything about just saying that feels wrong. I've never really known much about queer people, but to what I can tell there's supposed to be some relief to realizing what you are. I don't feel that? My life is over. It isn't actually something I can just fix and brush off. It isn't just the way l act. It's what I am. You always hear about being proud, but nobody talks about the shame. Maybe they just don't feel it. The problem is, I don't know what I'm ashamed of. Leading on my best friend? Deep-set homophobia? Or is it just the fact that I can't grow up and have a wife and kids and love a woman and be loved in return? I think it's all of them. I feel gross? Especially because he isn't even the first guy I've liked, I don't think. It's like I've betrayed all the boys I've called pretty, because they trusted that it didn't mean anything. But it does. I wish it didn't. The scariest part is that there's really, genuinely nothing I can do to get rid of this feeling. The feeling that rests in my chest, it'll just never go away? I feel like I need to fix it, I guess? Fix myself that is, not try to make girls something I can love, just change me. It isn't supposed to be like this, not for me. It's like I'm seeing myself for the first time. I don't like what I see.",

"Title: Advice for advice, I guess..?",
"Selftext: Hey, I’ve been wanting to post here for a long time, but im finally mentally sane enough to do so.",
"Within the past year, I’ve gone through a lot. I have a loooong history of childhood trauma, and a lot worse, but I’ve managed to gather myself again. I was on very hard dr*gs less than a year ago, and now I’m almost 16, and I’m working on moving out, and pursuing my career and education, by the side of the love of my life. (I know that sounds so cliche to say, but I really mean that.)",
"The main thing I want advice on, as of now, is the relationship itself. My boyfriend is newly 18, and im 16 in august. Him and I are literally on the same level in terms of mindsets, though. (For context, people immediately think I’m 20-25 when they first meet me. I’ve been used to that for years, tho.)",
"Our relationship is honestly everything I could have asked for, and so much more. He’s a caring and understanding guy, and he’s loyal and understanding. The best way I can describe him in terms of personality, is quite literally, a “golden retriever.” He’s perfect, and he treats me as an equal, and he reassures me. He’s also helped me through a ton of my trauma. We have so many plans, and it’s amazing what time can do. I very recently found out that him and I used to play as kids, too, which made our story so much more amazing than it was. I don’t want any issues with his parents, or the law, honestly. I know how to handle myself, I’ve been through hell and back like it’s the everyday stop at the gas station, lmao. 😭😂 I’m also coming to find out that my childhood made me sociopathic, and very able to manipulate people, too. It scares me, but ive learned how to grasp all of it a lot easier. My mind is just much more complex than most, sometimes. I just can’t believe I made it this far, honestly. I was on the verge of death, and now I’m soon to be proposing to my wonderful boyfriend. I didn’t think life would have mercy on me, ever. But it did..",
"…and for anyone who needs to hear it, life will have mercy on you, too, when the time is just right. Your time will come, you’ve just gotta work for it, and work on YOURSELF for it. I didn’t have my mom to tell me this, nor really anything. I was my own adult, because I had to be. I learned so much from my trauma in hindsight, though. I really didn’t think it got better, especially with my chronic pain that I’ve had all my life, but within no time, I’m getting completely sober and I’m leaving this place, but most importantly, healing.",
"You will come out better than life is around you, eventually. Remember that, because I never could for so long. I refused to believe I’d get better, but I did. And you will, too.",
"Anyways, I’m good at yapping, aren’t I? I’m glad I got to share this, tho. Peace ✌️☺️",

Title: What should i do?,
"Selftext: Short and simple i think, my mother Doesn't want her children watching ""brain rot"" i use that word very loosely.",
For me i wasn't allowed to watch any cartoon network or anyform of cartoon.,
Except Leap-frog an My little pony until i was 6 year's old and after that it was Khan academy and that felt awful cause she'd make me feel stupid for not knowing what to do.,
Anyhow I'm 16 now and offically discovered we bare bares again and other cartoons but that's my favorite atm.,
At the age of 12 i discovered anime through an ad and i wasn't allowed to watch it an neither of my siblings because.,
You should focus on studying instead of following these slow kid's and her going off about gen z being to dumb and stuff.,
But we did it anyways got away with it for 2 year's until my stepdad found out an ruined it for us.,
"Also we can't have a certain genre's of music when i was 11 - 13 yo cause ""It's devil music""",
Anyhow my 6 year old sister likes this show called catching teenieping and she enjoys that show and wants me to watch it with her.,
"And recently i asked why she doesn't watch it anymore because she uses to talk about it too me all the time and she says ""Cause mama beat my butt for watching it""",
So i stop in disbelief and i asked her to repeat herself and she says it again.,
So i go up to my mom and asked about the show and she said That the show was stupid and inappropriate for children.,
When the plot of the show is a young princess accidentally releases teeniepings and now her friends join her on a journey to get them back.,
While running a bakery and being a middle school student (i think she's in middle school),
The teenieping are emotions basics Happiness Sadness Fear Disgust Anger Surprise Excitement Calm Etc etc,
Also it provides ways for you too express your emotions in a healthy manner.,
So i don't see the problem and then she went off on the lgbtq+ community ( she's trying to change the subject) and how they're trying to indoctronate children and blah blah blah.,
So please i need to know how to deal with this women or get through to her. ,

First of all I don't understand why they believe AI will take over the world, as the whole basis of their argument is that it will get smarter than us and take over, but it already is and it hasn't done shit. As far as I can tell it has no emotions, it was no desires, and that's what make it artificial, however I also don't understand those who l use it frequently because in a way it impedes upon ones independence. That's my thoughts on it, what do y'all think.",

There is no cord progression yet might add it soon,
What genre do you think this is?,
"Her, Herself",
You know the feeling when nothing works when everything breaks and crumbles the moment you touch it,
hearts break into pieces,
souls melt and future burns,
you're alone you're alone ,
you want to die but not quite fully ,
you want to live but not quite fully ,
you're ghost nobody sees ,
then you meet her ,
"Her, herself in her own skin ",
everything is great ,
stomachs fly mind become unpredictable but you still invisible ,
her herself becomes a canvas ,
paint are your dreams ,
brush become stomach you fly with ,
paint boy paint throw some yellow red and green throw some happy passionate peace ,
you don't care about money hoes and gold you think that's bold ,
you were humble from the start ,
look where you are now not a fraction not a piece of the incredible dreams you dream ,
dream on boy dream that's what they said you still roam and roam,
no hopes on the road,
Where to now go ,
no heart no soul ,
that was sold long long ago,
for what you may ask,
for the dreams I was told to dream,
by the dream killers and dream stealers ,
no hope no gold dreams didn't come true ,
truth and product ,
dreamers the believers ,
she her herself didn't come true ,
didn't come true (x4),
I tried and I tried a thousand tries (x4),
not enough will it ever be enough (x2),
Will I ever be enough (x2),
did I just try just to die,
Everyone sees the rain but not the drops,
Untill someone drops dead,

Title: The Science- Based WAY to Achieve ULTIMATE Consistency ,
"Selftext: Since being on self improvement for about 2 years I’ve learned what consistency is NOT. For example, it is not about  writing a to do list the night before and labeling what you are going to do the next day. Consistency is not about going through stages of isolation where you are focusing on doing the work and forcing it. It is also not about waiting for the perfect time of when you feel good either. It has only been through learning from trial and error of this BS youtube videos of what people say consistency is about only to find myself trying something for a couple of days, and messing up right after then going back to my old ways. I am sure that many of you reading this right now struggle with something similar and you want to get off this cycle of trying something for a few days, stopping, trying again only to realize you are never going to be consistent. In this video right here: https://youtu.be/TIPX2LcADWg?si=laPhfyc2vWemhmey ",
I talk about the ACTUAL science based method of becoming more consistent. If you make this change you will FINALLY start seeing the results you have been looking for. ,
Consistency is the number one key to self improvement and I specially highlight that in the video attached.,

Title: How do I become official with a guy,
"Selftext: I've been talking to this guy who I met at camp for two weeks. We call just about everyday for at least 45 min and text everyday. I really like where it's going and I want to become official. There are a handful of set backs though, he lives 5 hours away, same state but just barely. Also it seems that in his past relationships he made the first move, though I've been taking a bit more initiative in texting and what not. So the fact he hasn't asked yet kinda worries me. But lastly I'm worried that two weeks might be too little, I know I'm ready but I don't know if I should give it a bit longer or not",
Title: So I've done poetry but I only showed my friends because I'm not super proud of my work but this one I wanted to share,
Selftext: You want your passion for what you show off,
 And your heart wants it to get what it desires,
 And let him want you to be kind,
 He is sincere and pledges loyalty to you,
 I have never seen someone in love with someone comfortable,
 I don't see any cheeks that have the right air,
 How many lovelorn people have been stabbed and lost?,
" They winced and said, “We did not care about him.”",
 I'm crazy as you can see,
 I am one individual and there are thousands of others,
 My eyes are neglected and my tears are flowing,
 And my heart is lost in love and I miss it,
 I did not ask about my loved ones,
 I prayed about your distress,
" May God reward you, I did not see it",
 According to the description of no one else,
 He took away his affection from me and did not treat me with mercy,
 My condition is ill and my wound is stupid,
" If it happened to others, what happened to me would be the same",
 Let no one think about the deliciousness of his dinner,
 My people calls me with many echoes,
 There were many hopes and many promises,
" He dates, breaks up, and comes back again",
 And I have been hoping for it all my life,
" Friendly, the beloved and kind man, forced me",
 I am in love with him and he is at ease,
 Sometimes we sing and sometimes we shout,
 I wasted my life on his level,
" Sleepless nights , ally of love",
" A lame, lame, stuffed animal",
" My sleep, strength, and drinking are forbidden",
 And he who cursed him in his heart is not to be blamed,
I complain and cry and no one answers,
 And whoever is steadfast will be rewarded,
" Oh help God, I am right",
 And the wound of love is difficult for me to heal,
" I adore my beloved, unique beauty",
 It has a proverb from the deer's wanderings,
 Eyes and good as good dexterity,
 A crescent moon completes its brilliance,
 And our life was surprising,
 And a bright rose on his cheek,
 And a cheek with bright teeth,
 A light in its mouth with waving lightnings,
 Its scent is a nectar that heals wounds,
 Its scent is an amber breeze,
 The air is cold even if the lips smell it,
 More like ....... like stepson's eggs,
 And....... His religion and his waist is a pocket,
 And....... the dune's flats are high,
 Whipped by belief isolates his team,
 He electrocuted my heart and senses,
 My heart left a seam in it,
 I'm going to die while I'm young,
 The clothes of his back and his possessions were blown apart,
" And he mixed tea, and after that he drank it",
 He hung me with a rope and rubbed it,
 And my father was left hanging behind him,
" You see, longing has a taste, lovers",
 And the place of reproach is between two,
 If he is in love and this is a suspicion,
 Love's reproach sees its sweetness,

I started falling out of love though, she never talks to me when we're together, like we went on a walk for about an hour, and I was talking to her and gave her oppurtunities to say stuff to me, but she just never says something. Which is really annoying and not attractive to me.",

She asked me on a date again and I can't bring myself to saying no..,

He didn’t seem to get it as he proceeded to tell me that they were my things and I needed to take care of them I told him I didn’t know they had been brought in for the second time and he told me that it doesn’t matter and that I need to take care of my things and I tried to tell him for a third time that I didn’t know the things were inside but he didn’t seem to care ,

Title: I hate my family and myself,
"Selftext: I absolutely hate my culture. My dad has always tried to force me to eat our food and partake in our traditions but I hate it and anything associated with it. I have a lot of trauma because of my dad and even hate the language that my family speaks because of it. My mom emotionally abused me after she left my dad who physically abused her. I've spent my entire life dealing with both of their bs because my mom ""is doing her best"" and I ""should think of all the stress she's had."" I have to deal with my dad because ""he's just stubborn"" and ""he will never change."" He acts r-worded sometimes and doesn't have any common sense. I can tell him I'm about to throw up but will continue to force me to do something. He has even sexualized me since I was a child and no matter what I say everyone plays it off as ""he's just your dad you're reading into it."" What kind of dad will walk into their daughters room without knocking (I don't have a lock) when he **knows** she's changing as says she looks *good* while she's wearing just a oversized shirt (no pants or shorts) when she's barely a preteen. I get absolutely disgusted when he touches me in certain parts of my body when I'm trying to get away from him but he grabs me. I fear masculine men because of him and don't feels safe when I'm alone with someone stronger than me. ",
"I can't stand my grandparents either because the ones on my dad's side are very conservative (in a bad way) and bigots and my mom's side doesn't speak english very well so I get triggered when I hear them speaking in out language. I love them a lot but sometimes I can't handle it. The only thing my grandpa on my mom's side ever talks to me about is studies and my grandma only tries to force me to eat something even if I say no a million times. My mom is even worse as the only thing she does is berate me over school or college applications. I was on the verge of dying a few months ago and all she cared about was me studying for a test (no I do not care if she did care inside, she should at least show some sympathy like a normal parent, even a stranger would be less harsh). I was catcalled and harassed on the street by some drunk guys while walking back from a friends place and my mom told me to suck it up and it's just life. (It was a busy street and not even dark yet) On top of it 90% of the time she has a disgusted look on her face whenever she talks to me and degrades me. I honestly don't know how she can cuss me out and then when I bring it up later she blames it on the heat of the moment. There are many things I can also say in the heat of the moment but I don't because the ounce of respect I have for her can keep my mouth shut. I'm almost 100% sure that if I had any other parents my life would be much better. I'm almost 100% sure that even if I was poor and homeless my life would be better because at least I would have my sanity. At least I wouldn't have to live in a world where my dad has said I'm not his daughter twice and my mom spits at me when she sees me. ",

I don’t know of any place that’d take adult runaways, nor can I think of a place he can reasonably run off *to*. His mom is paying for part of his tuition, so he feels like he has to stay for the money. Ideally we rent together and he doesn’t need his mom’s money, but neither of us are fully employed. He’s gonna leave eventually, but I want him out of that house as early as possible. What should I do?",

Title: I think I’m being falsely accused of SA,
"Selftext: Alright so for this story there is a lot of context to know that’s necessary. First of all, me and the girl I’m talking about are both 15. We started talking when we both started high school and eventually got into a talking stage, which was on and off usually just for stupid reasons which we could both laugh about later on. About 1.5 years ago she started opening up to me about her depression. She told me things like harming herself etc. I was always there for her and eventually convinced her to talk to a teacher about it. Later she got into a relationship with a boy, but he treated her terribly and even though she told him about everything going on with her he tried manipulating her into sending pictures and stuff like that and started spreading lies about her. Eventually they broke up and she told her parents about her depression and self-harm. When all of this was happening I was always there for her and tried helping her however I could. Later on she decided that it would be better if me and her wouldn’t have any contact for a while so she could use all of her limited energy on herself an trying to get better. Over the next year me and her were talking sometimes throughout the year and since december of last year we have been talking daily and we started to catch feelings for each other again. She also told me stuff like how she tried to commit suicide multiple times last year. One day, she didn’t respond to my messages and when I asked her what happened she told me that she was in the hospital because she tried to OD. A few days later she got out and me and her hung out a few days later with another friend of her. Then a few days later we hung out again, went bowling, I watched her football/soccer match and we were basically together all day with a few other friends of her. At the end of the day we kissed for the first time and I went home. We decided to see each other again a few days later and it was amazing. We were in her room all day making out the entire time, basically just a cringy teenage relationship. She took her shirt off and we just continued what we were doing and after a while I asked her if she would be comfortable taking off her bra as well, and she said that she didn’t want to do it now, which I responded to that that’s totally okay and that I completely understand it. We continued what we were doing again and eventually she was basically laying on top of me while we were making out and she started pushing my head down to her breasts and I was kissing her body all the way down there. She held my head while I was down there and basically pushed me against them, so one one breast, I slightly pulled down her bra and started kissing her there for a few seconds and then went back up again. She still seemed completely comfortable and I asked her if she made up her mind and she nodded with a big smile on her face. We just continue making out and eventually I had to go to my football training. After I left she told me that she had an absolutely amazing time and that that day was perfect and her best day ever. She also sent me some of those corny tiktoks (that’s something we do often) and some of then where things like “touchy gf + touchy bf >>>” and stuff like that. She didn’t respond for a while and later that night she told me that she tried to kill herself again and that she would be admitted to a mental hospital. This is about the 4th time she tried it but this time she definitely got the closest to actually having it happen. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to keep up a relationship which I completely understood. She promised me that once this is all over that we would go back to what we had. We continued to just talk over the phone while she was there and we were still telling each other “I love you” and sending each other those corny tiktoks. She felt completely miserable in there and I tried being there for her and was sending her sweet texts every day. Some of those cringy tiktoks were things like “I’m craving you so much” which she responded “Soon I’m all yours again” to and “Once I get 1 kiss I need a 100 more” which she responded “Once I’m out there will be a lot of more kissed for you” and one that basically said that we should just marry which she responded “In three years” to. So basically we were still in love with each other and doing what cringy teenagers do. Eventually she told me that she completely lost all hope in life and that she’s only pretending to still have hope so that she’ll get out so she can do something again. I felt terrible hearing this and decided to tell her parents about this and they were very grateful. Of course she was angry at me at first, which is completely understandable but I know that it was for the better. She eventually forgave me but decided that we should have a little bit less contact now and eventually we stopped having contact. I though that this was because she didn’t want people to care about her too much so that it wouldn’t hurt them a lot if she dies, and she confirmed this later. Eventually she told me that we can have contact again but limited because she has to stick all of her energy into getting better, and I respected this of course. This also ended shortly and all of our contact now basically existed with me responding to her reposts on tiktok, assuring her she’s beautiful (because that was the main reason of her depression, basically hating herself and her body) etc. Eventually she reposted a video about that just had some dates in it (dates as in feb. 11 for example) and it included the last day that we were together. I looked in the comments and saw people talking about those days like they were amazing dates, so I thought that that were her intentions for that repost as well, so I responded to her that it was the best day of my life. Of course I didn’t mean the last part of the day, but just the part that me and her were together. She got mad at me because I understood it wrong and she told me that it wouldn’t work out between us and that we should stop having contact. She has already been back home for a few weeks now by the way. Yesterday, I saw a repost of her that was about being SA’d and I responded saying that this is very serious and I asked her who did this to her. Later she told me that it was about us and I was completely shocked. She told me that when I slightly pulled her bra down she just froze and let it happen and I just didn’t understand. She told me that it was the best day of her life, she immediately started making out with me for like an hour after it happened, she told me she loved me, after I left she told her parents that we were dating, she sent me those corny tiktoks, she told me that we’d marry in 3 three years when we’re both 18, she told me that once she’s back she’s all mine again, after I left she was with one of her friends and told her all about what happened and how amazing it was and she promised me that whatever happens, that we’d go back to what we had. Who would do things like that after feeling like she just got SA’d? She now told me that she would leave it at this if I stopped texting her, but I’m still scared to death that she’ll take this any further. She can ruin my life with these accusations. Was I in the wrong? And would should I do now? Is she just remembering it wrong because of everything else going on?",
So I wrote this and poster it about two months ago. Now I got a message from her mom saying she wants to talk about what her daughter told her about this day. What should I do?,
