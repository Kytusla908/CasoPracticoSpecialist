"I, M20, still live at home with mom and her bf while I pursue my 2nd associates degree.  My parents got divorced when I was 14.  Overall, growing up was not ideal, my father was physically and verbally abusive as well as an alcoholic and my mom not much better just more verbally abusive, although she has laid hands on me and my youngest sister a couple times.  My 2 older sisters and my grandparents practically raised me throughout the years.  My parents got divorced because they both cheated on each other, the man my mom is with is the man she cheated on my dad with, so there’s some resentment there to begin with.  
I currently am little to no contact with my dad due to actions post-divorce that I simply cannot forgive. During the custody talks, i basically was met with a decision of choosing the lesser of two evils when it came to who I wanted to live with, so I ultimately chose my mother.  During the divorce, my mom paid no mind to me, she cared more about getting child support out of my dad as well as appeasing her new boyfriend, she posted about it publicly on Facebook and garnered sympathy, the only person that ever checked on me was my oldest sister, I admittedly still am not over the divorce because I feel as though I never got any form of closure. From that point to now, my mom has been one of the most shallow people I’ve ever known in my life, even more than when she was with my dad, she makes me feel like a burden to her as well defending her bf’s questionable actions.  I believe him to be a carbon copy of my dad.  My mom has defended him when he was made downright awful statements, sexual in nature toward my sisters as well as girls that I brought over in the 6 years I’ve known him. I recall a time my mom telling me, “I wish I met (bf) earlier on, that way I could’ve divorced your dad and you would’ve been a better student and a better athlete in high school.”  I hear that in my head every night when I lay down.  On top of that, my mom has this obsession with being skinny so she makes comments about my weight, even though I have been told my body is perfectly normal by my doctor and others around me, this got to the point it hurt me so much that I’ve started wearing shirts that are 1-2 sizes bigger. She says awful comments to me over petty things, for example, there was a sweatshirt on my floor this morning because I took it off after I got hot in my sleep and she tells me “why can’t you keep your room clean? You can’t seem to do anything right”, or if I leave a plate in the sink she tells me how much of a slob I am. If something is not done to her specifications or the way she wants it, I don’t stop hearing about it until the end of the day, I get told that I’m useless, that I’ll never be able to live on my own, or that no girl will ever wanna marry me.  Today I reached a breaking point and left to go to my oldest sister’s house, my mother called me shortly after I arrived and continued to berate me over the phone, telling me I don’t do anything around the house and that I’m useless and that I’m just like my father.  Maybe I’m not making it sound as bad as it is, I’m a terrible storyteller, but these last 6 years with my mom have been nothing but a stain on my mental health, I can’t tell her how I feel because she tries to turn it around on me and make me feel bad.  I’ve always struggled with depression since I was a child and I’ve just kind of learned to live with it, however as of recent the thought has been swirling around to just take my own life, I firmly believe that I am not good enough for anyone or anything in this world, that if I am not worthy of a mother’s love, am I worthy of any love at all? It’s been 6 years of build up and I just don’t know what to do, I’ve tried counseling and medication, none of it helps, I’m not financially stable enough to move out and neither of my sisters nor my grandparents have the room to take me in.  I’m making this post as a last ditch effort to seek advice or even words of encouragement.  Thank you to all for taking the time out of your day to read this."
"i am honestly on the verge of self harm. i can’t even block them because i feel like it’s wrong if i do. i am still so under their spell i feel like if i block them that’ll upset them. can someone tell me to do it for my own sake? i know this is with 0 context but i don’t have the energy to even say more than this. i already went as far as to stop sharing location but that’s scaring me so bad i thought they would call the cops. they still might.

"(sorry that this is long, it's complicated) every time I share any part of my situation with my mother, no one understands what I'm going through, so I'm just gonna try to keep it short. lots of my siblings agree that my mother is abusive and so does my father. idk what started this whole issue but someday the ""peace"" that once existed within my family was absolutely destroyed, leaving me with a life where my mother tries to take over the family with legal power and abusing the power of being a guardian. P.S. She identifies as a Christian and has strictly believed many things in the bible  
  
since divorce processes take a while, (especially when you're trying to manage a \*family\* business your wife won't put the effort into assisting in the way you have been in the past decade) she has a lot of power against what belongs to who, (involving the kids). the reason why I know so much about all this is because my mom starts drama about almost anything in front of us whether it's about the kids or about the marriage.  
  
I'm lucky that no one in my family thinks what she's doing is fair, but she uses her legal right to control the family. and my 2 younger siblings struggle with deciding which parent to obey, especially when they are afraid of what the mother will do if they disobey her unreasonable demands I'm more defiant. thankfully she's out of the house most of the time because of everything that's going on. P.S. She plays the victim a lot by using facts yet morphing them into points that don't make sense for the disagreement. (if that makes sense) if she doesn't use facts, she'll just make her feelings the priority even when what should be the priority is logic/the point of the problem. I'm living in hell when my dad isn't there to make things right though, so I've tried my hardest to keep as much distance as I can when I need to.   
  
things got wild the night that I'm writing this bc my mom has re-attempted to take things related to the family and the love that once existed between my parents. me and my 2 siblings were there waiting for her to leave to the place she said she'd go to. the first thing she tried to take was a \*gift\* that she made for my father and her reasoning of why she should be able to take it was ""I made it myself and now I want it back."" my family agreed that that's not how it works but of course, my parents aren't officially divorced so she has legal ownership but it was morally wrong. in short, things got rough and my mother didn't seem to care about what we were feeling and she wouldn't stop physically trying to take a gift from my father's hands. when she cooperated. she made it seem like she was forced to instead of her agreeing to bc it was the right thing to do.  
  
it was a hurtful experience that I wish could be deeply understood without sharing too much info, but this experience combined with many others has left me with the aching wish of her not living, also because once the divorce process is done and things calm down she still lives life easy by relying on the money my father has earned by handling the business which is undeserved knowing what my father has had to go through these past months.

\*GRAPHIC\*  
I've imagined many things around the house in my hands as a tool to mash the side of my mother's head. I've never remembered my mother suffering through any kind of injury, so the thought of her suffering a lethal one after years of living an easy life was a comforting dream for me.

This is my first time sharing something like this at this degree and having it be so public, but I'm doing this bc I have no one to talk to, and I feel like no one understands, believes, or cares about what I'm going through (other than my father). sorry for making this long, I needed to add context to the complexity of her ridiculous logic. idk how views and impressions work on social media, but if you read all of this and actually care abt what I'm saying, tysm. please respond and tell me if you think what I'm saying is stupid or if it makes sense and ig share your thoughts on it, but yeah"
"My life has been a train wreck. I’m only 19 now and I’ve already survived human tra***cking and various forms of abuse both in relationships and family settings. 
Not all things are horrible for me. I finally found my first real group of friends and I get the opportunity to go to college, aswell as have a roof over my head. But…I have NEVER had real help or support for most of my life.
At times my mom is the best mom ever, others she is pure pressuring a recovering Anorexic to go on a weight loss pill…which I did for a while.
I try very hard to make her happy and at ease, but when she catches me being “unproductive” and giggling in my room….it’s like I committed a crime.
There are times I do loose track of time when talking with my friends or making art, but everything with her and my dad is on eggshells all the time.
I love them, but their personalities shift so much.
I am working long hard hours to try and save for my own place, but I don’t even know how to do taxes or where to go for help."
"He can be such a controlling asshole who I can't say anything about while he uses me to feel better about himself. But he has his moments where I do feel for and understand him and times when he can make me actually feel my potential...but it's all overshadowed when he does the exact opposite, so I ask myself, why do I feel so guilty around him. Why is it I feel so much hatred yes love for him. I don't get it. When he dies I will be the last one crying at his grave while I carry his casket. Wtf kinda child am I."
"Is there some physiological reason my mom cries after screaming and hitting me and my siblings? My mother is physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive. She gets very mad very easily and tries to blame me and my siblings for everything that ever goes wrong or went wrong in her life. It’s not like the physical abuse is happening is very day, sometimes she lasts a whole month without  hitting us but this physical abuse started happening when I was 6 and and I am now 17 about to turn 18. My two sisters are 14 and 9 and even they can’t escape from our mother’s abuse. Even tho the physical abuse doesn’t happen everyday; there is not a day where my mother doesn’t scream at us. We just got out of a fight that included her yelling at us and attacking us (for no reason even tho she swears it’s our fault) and she started crying, and now she locked herself in her room and is probably crying. She has no reason to cry, shes the one who is abusive so why is she crying? Why does my mother cry after shes done hitting us? There was to be some physiological explanation for this."
"I just don't know how to cope with the comments that my mother gives me they are mostly negative. In relation to my weight and appearance. Please be kind.

I grew up with my mother as my main parent for a lot of my childhood. My real father was extremely abusive to her and we ran away. I was forced to see him every fortnight by the courts and the memories of the things he did still haunts me. As soon as I was legally an adult I cut him out of my life.

My mother herself will admit that she had a narcissist mother who would often be violent. Show little feelings of love or comfort towards my mother.
 She would often not feed my mother resulting in my mother being emasicated and extremely unwell. When my mother describes herself as ""painfully thin"" she often smiles about this and acts proud. Although not diagnosed with an ED she has always been heavily focused on calories and weight as long as I can remember.

For context she is very thin and is a size uk zero to 6. 
She still often refers to me as the chunky one in the family. Comments on my legs being thick and wobbly. She mentions often that she would like me to have children so that my belly can become big and saggy. 

like many teenagers that grew up in the late 90s and early 2000. I struggled with my body image, I would do anything to be thin.

I moved out early and still to this day have never received a phone call from her. I make all the effort to plan things. When we do talk or see one another she doesn't ask me anything about My life. Show any interest, When I try to she will start talking about herself or change the topic entirely. When we are in a group and I start talking, she talks over me.

and ended up spending the majority of my 20s in an unhappy and in a abusive relationship. 
 I never felt anything good about myself. I thought of myself as ""nothing"". My mental and physical health was the worst its ever been. I was experiencing many of the side effects of having an ED. I confided in my mother about what my ex partner was putting me through. She convinced me to stay in that relationship. Dispute later telling me she hated my ex partner. 
She is never able to offer me any worthwhile advice. Always blaming the problems in my life on my own actions. 

The police where called by a neighbour after a paticularly violent incident and I was set free 10 years of living in fear, pain and violence all gone away. The chance of a better life for myself although unaware of it at the time. I was still suffering the effects of believing that everything that happened to me was my own fault. I spent weeks of having crippling panic attacks. Eventually I learned to relive again.

I started secretly chatting and eventually dating to my long term crush. I moved into my own bedsit. I realised that they are a truly beautiful person, they helped repair some of the damage caused. We moved together fell in love and got engaged. They taught me a passion for life and how to enjoy everything including food. 

My body became healthy. I realised what having that feels like. I still struggle with body image and dismorphia. I have a good support system in place. I have been seen by a doctor who put me in a lower end but healthy BMI. Again just for context I am a uk size 8 and 6ft.
 
She was heavily critical of every decision that I made while planning my wedding and was extremely negative.

I took my mother wedding dress shopping and she was unable to say anything good. I choose the one according to my mother that didn't make me look ""big"" or ""fat"". 

She purchased a white wedding dress to wear to my wedding. When I mentioned I was hurt by this she went on a tangent saying that I only want her to look ""horrible"". She didn't wear the dress due to the support of my family after I explained the suitation they politely explained that the dress just doesnt suit her. 

We got married recently after a year of planning. It was everything that I dreamed of. I struggled with trying not to starve myself but managed to stay on track knowing that alterations are expensive and my dress fit well. 

The day before the wedding we went out for a big family meal. The only topic of conversation from her was about my husband looking nervous and regretting his decision to marry me. She keep whispering in my ear things along the lines of he won't turn up. 

The morning of my wedding I tried so hard to ignore the comments that she was making. She did her best to job distract the hair and MUA to prevent them from being able to focus on me. 
I asked her to help me put on my dress and this I regret deeply. She made a big issue of not being able to do it up. She spent 20 minutes commenting that I had put on loads of weight, despite me being aware that my weight is exactly the same as when I tried it on. When I mentioned this she tutted and asked ""you think so do you?"". 
Unfortunately after comment and negative criticism it did take its toll. Tried my best to put myself into the headspace of not thinking about my body and more on my beautiful husband. 

When I was fully dressed for my wedding and ready to go I never got any positive comments from my mother.
she swore and shouted at me in front of all my closest freinds and family just before I was about to walk down the isle. Seeing my husbands happiness at the end of it made it better.

When the photographer was around it was hard not to think about how ""fat"" I would look in the photos being taken, I felt unable to relax.

Dispute the negative impact of my mother I did have a beautiful wedding and an amazing time but I can't look at the photos of myself and feel attractive. I understand that a wedding is about marriage and me and my partner have a wonderful relationship where we have open communication.

I informed the wedding party about her behaviour and they where shocked. From now on I believe the best way to live my life is to focus on my marriage.

 I have brought up her behaviour in the past but as you can imagine it hasn't gone down well and it's always been ""my fault"". I spoke about her behaviour to my stepdad who simply put it down to my mother having verbal diarrhea. He explained that she is unaware of her words and the way they make others feel. I wouldn't describe my mother as happy in her appearance in fact it's quite the opposite. I always thought that narcissists belive that the are greatest best and most beautiful amazing people ever. However I don't know why else she would behave like this. I heard of grey rock syndrome. She also has strong emotions and the ability to feel things. She appears to lack something however. Could it be that she is emotionally immature ?. I would like to know so I can understand it better.

Dispute everything I love my mother it's difficult and complicated. I have come to accept that she cannot listen and doesn't understand the impact of her words

"My father abused and neglected me for 16years until i stopped visiting him due to COVID. My therapist advised me to write a letter and burn it, which i’m going to do. But i want to print out another copy and send it to him. I’ve gone no contact and this would be the last thing i ever said to him. I want it to have a jarring end. Like the typical email salutations eg. With love, but reversed so it’s Without Love, [my name]. 


any tips on this or the writing in general?"

"When I was 3, my dad broke the law and had to leave home. This left me with my mum and things were calm for a while. Eventually, he saw us more and more frequently then when I was 7 he moved in again to our new house. My mum and dad would argue more and more over the next few years until they would scream at each other for hours most days. Doors slammed, broken plates, road rage. My dad would never halm anyone physically, but he certainly would emotionally. Don’t get me wrong, my mum wasn’t perfect either, but at least when I looked through one of our bookshelves I found self help books with her notes in them. Also, whenever I had an issue I would go to my mum and she would help and support me. Me and my dad however were never that close and I wouldn’t even hug him. Then when I was 11, on Friday 13th March, 2020, the beginning of COVID, my mum passed away due to an aneurysm. The house felt eerily quiet and empty without her, and after that I would never be the same. The whole world was falling apart. I wasn’t going to school, and I’d just lost the one person I cared about most- my own mum. After that, me, my brother and my dad would hardly discuss the situation and instead just carry on as if nothing happened. Over the next few years, it would become more and more apparent to me that my dad had major anger issues, was emotionally absent and even controlling. He would call me names, criticise me, yell, not communicate whatsoever, and not try to change even when I made an effort to calmly tell him how he affected me. He even told me he was normal and every parent was like him. If I didn’t do what he said, he’d get really mad and simply give up trying. He gave up dealing with us a lot. He hates solving issues. My dad doesn’t even enjoy having normal conversations with me, or anyone for that matter, but especially me. When I try to talk to him for more than 5 minutes he will barely respond, tell me what I’m saying is a “stream of consciousness” (aka boring) or that I’m making him think too much. I understand that he’s not that social, but it feels like even short conversations bother him- from his own children. All of these issues with him and the rest of my family have caused me long term trauma and I feel like I can’t make any friends because no one likes me. If he can’t have constructive conversations with me, I seriously feel bad for my mum too. So in conclusion, I don’t know what to do because he has anger issues, cannot communicate and doesn’t want to change.
By the way, before anyone says it, yes I know he’s got to work and does a lot of the chores etc. But I’d rather be in a family where I have to do that myself and I feel actually cared for, than one which is the other way around."
You can come and vent to me if u want. 
"My mom said that my dad can see my activity, such as when I'm on my phone and what apps I'm on. 

This has caused me so much anxiety, as I have tiktok and Reddit which I'm not supposed to have. They havent said anything about that yet. I'm also a teenager doing teenager stuff, would prefer if my parents could not see everything on my phone. 

I don't have a great relationship with them and hate them knowing things about me in general. 

A quick google search and I found things like if you phone battery dies quickly or your phone lags or freezes a lot it could mean there's a tracking app installed. Both of these things seem to apply to my phone and I'm honestly really scared of them being able to see what I'm doing and when Im on my phone. I've looked through my settings and my ipod is under ""family"" there, which is under my moms email (I blocked it after that) but didn't find anything else. I'm not techy at all so I have no clue what to look for and where to look. I've googled this to no avail. 

I have tried telling her that I don't like being monitored and that its an invasion of privacy but she won't listen. Please help. 

Im sorry if this is the wrong place, my parents are emotionally and somewhat physically abusive and I dont know where else to go. "
"Throwaway account? Ish? I don’t know, I don’t regularly use Reddit, I just troll. 

TLDR: a ramble 

I (17f) feel like I’m at the end of the rope with my parents. I’m so exhausted and overwhelmed constantly. I usually scroll through this group trying to downplay my parents and trick myself into thinking that I’m fine and everything’s fine. My parents do not get along with each other at all. They’re the stereotypical parents that should be divorced but likely never will. My mom is a narcissist and possibly bipolar, she tried therapy for a few years but then decided that therapy was a bad thing. It wouldn’t matter anyway, she just spins her web around the therapist and makes herself out to be the victim in every situation. My dad is an alcoholic, likely from having to put up with my mom, for years. He can get somewhat physically abusive at times but he constantly shouts, gets into fights with my mom, etc. I’ve had things like glass, phones, anything within reach thrown at my head, I’ve been choked. I feel like they argue constantly. When they’re not arguing, they like to gang up on me. My dad always agrees with my mom’s opinions (if he’s not mad at her) and they both constantly berate me. I feel like they hate me. She always talks about life before me and how life would be without me. My mom constantly threatens to kill my animals, in a “joking” manner. I think she loathes me over the animals that she bought for me. Her new tagline is that she’ll clear out my bank account. Unfortunately she has access to it entirely. I’ve been working since I was young, from under the table to official jobs. Surprisingly family therapy was tried. I don’t think it did anything. I was almost mute the entire time because what was I going to say? My parents just whined that I spent too much time in my room. A few days before that meeting, I was grounded for staying in my bedroom while they were screaming at each other. I think my mom’s favorite pastime is to take things away from me and see how much I care. I bought my phone and pay for cellular but she constantly takes it away from me and grounds me from it. When she can’t have the phone, she will just shut off the internet to spite everyone. On the outside, she wants to maintain a perfect public image for her friends and the church. I have high grades and an even higher gpa due to the amount of college courses she enrolled me in while still in highschool. Supposedly, she’s paying for my college too. Lately, I feel like my thick skin has been stripped and I am left with no protection against their words and actions. I stood my ground for so long and I feel like it has shattered. My mind is going dark places and I just need to make it pass my college years before I can breathe.

"When I was growing up, and especially when I was little, I idolized my father.
I thought he was a great role model and his presence made me happy.
When I was a teen we would occasionally get into arguments, sometimes more severe and sometimes less but I still respected him and enjoyed his company overall. These arguments were always verbal, never physical except on one memorable occasion when he shoved me.
I wouldn’t say these arguments were out of the ordinary for what I think goes on in most families.
And my father, in many ways, was a very good dad when I was growing up. He was generous, usually pleasant and easy-going, he provided me and my brother with everything we ever needed, supported us in all our endeavors, and I related to him a lot as I felt many of our interests were similar. We share the same birthday and he has often expressed to me that I was the best birthday present he ever received.

Over my (27, almost 28M) young adult life my perception of my father has changed drastically as I have recently observed a number of verbally abusive behaviors from him towards me, my brother and my mom. While is possible that he has always acted this way to some degree and I just didn’t notice it as a child, I think he has gotten much worse over the years and my brother agrees. I don’t remember him acting this way when I was a kid. When he gets angry he does these things: He yells at all of us. He curses. He is passive aggressive, or sometimes very directly aggressive. He says things that are mean or derogatory. I remember him calling me “sensitive” in a derogatory way in an argument last year.

Things first got bad about 2 years ago when he had a fight with my mom about a bag of fruit that she threw out (not joking). He had picked the fruit from the yard himself a couple days prior but the fruit was starting to get old and soft. I wouldn’t have eaten it at that point. When he noticed it in the trash, he fished it out, tossed it at my mom and called her a b****. That was the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” things had been pretty pleasant and normal before then (not exactly as things were when I was a kid but similar) but after that I was deeply shaken. I should note that my mom does yell in arguments too and says some things back at my dad when they are arguing, but she is never abusive like that. 

Now since then there have been a number of arguments between me and my dad. We have talked these through, and each time he apologizes but it seems to me like he is always making excuses to go along with the apology, or at least that’s how I see it. He says he’s just telling me his own perspective and explaining what happened and why, and I usually take those as excuses but I wonder if I’m judging him too harshly and they’re not really excuses because isn’t it fair to give someone your perspective or explain what happened after an argument?

Anyway, things have felt a little teeter-totter since then. I’ll often have a visit or two where everything is fine, he’s the same generous loving father I remember: there are no arguments, he’s happy to see me, he hugs me, calls me “buddy,” we do fun activities together, he treats me to lunch etc. and I feel like the relationship is healing, but then the next visit we get into another argument and I lose a little more respect for him and I feel so awful.
So fast forward to today. My dad and my mom moved this weekend, and my brother and I went to help them with the move.

Well last night a couple hours after arriving to their new home we got into another argument. The house was very warm when we arrived and we switched on the A/C immediately but after several hours as it neared bedtime it was still pretty warm in the bedroom and I was worried that I wasn’t going to be able to sleep well so I expressed my concern repeatedly. That was probably annoying, I was just anxious because I really needed a good night’s sleep. Then I walked around the house trying to make sure the vents were all open, etc. and found that my dad had left a window open while they were gone despite it being 100 degrees outside and they hadn’t closed them since arriving. I came out and said maybe it would be cooler if my dad hadn’t left the window open. Honest to goodness I wasn’t trying to incite anything, I was just annoyed.
And that is when it happened. 
My dad said “f*** you” to me, went into his own room and shut the door. I didn’t see him for the rest of the night. I was deeply hurt.
I take responsibility for my own comment, I probably shouldn’t have/didn’t need to say that but his reaction was so unwarranted.

For context, I am a pretty calm and relaxed person the vast majority of the time. This is not just my own perception - everyone I know says this about me. They consider my calmness one of my defining traits. Perhaps because of my innate nature or perhaps as a reaction to the very strong personalities in my family, I have made a conscious effort in my life to process my emotions in healthy, productive ways, including my anger. I never yell at my friends and especially never at my partner. The cycle ends with me. Unfortunately however, I find that I do yell at my parents and my brother. I have found it difficult to change with them, as they are so explosive. Aside from those three, I find it is easy to maintain my composure and refrain from yelling.

So this morning he gave me a somewhat weak apology, the same deal as many other arguments. He said he was sorry and then started trying to explain what happened. I said he was making excuses.
He started yelling at me and I yelled back. I yelled at him that cursing his own son out like that was abusive and that I would not accept it. He claimed that I was provoking him and doing things to push his buttons. I said that was not my intention and all I wanted to hear from him was that what he said was wrong and that he wouldn’t do it again. After all, I probably shouldn’t have said what I said but what he said was much worse. He said I had to acknowledge that I was pushing his buttons and inciting things and that his feelings were valid too. I certainly would have acknowledged that in different circumstances but because of the context I saw that as more excuses and avoiding a real apology so I told him I had nothing left to say. Now we haven’t spoken more than a few words in a few hours.

So Reddit, I understand that I need to process this on my own terms and the way I see fit. Maybe I need some therapy.
But just as a gut reaction what do you all you folks out there think of this?
What would be an appropriate course of action? Is this able to be resolved? Should I apologize to him for “pushing his buttons?” What do you think is the best path forward? 
I don’t want to react too extremely, I do still love my dad and I don’t want him out of my life. That being said, every time we have one of these arguments it is slowly but surely tarnishing a family relationship that I’ve known and cherished my whole life.
Thanks in advance for your responses.

"Hi so recently im a bit confused regarding an incident, so to give context it’s regarding my mother who i believe isn’t completely ‘emotionally normal’, i would not go into the details as i have already in another post so it doesn’t matter, the thing is that
A few months back, i remembered an incident of when i was around 5 or 6 i guess, my ‘mother’, getting an ‘episode’ or something as usual and she went to the kitchen threatening to kill herself, idr exactly but i think I went inside ig and then she held my hand and tried doing it to  me as well, I somehow managed to get out of the situation, but I remember she said something while holding my hand like ‘yeah you come along with me as well’ idr exactly tho.
Also this wasn’t the first time she tried harming herself the second or third time ig, theonly difference was she tried doing it to me as well this time.
But i dont get it, why after all these years have a randomly out of nowhere recalled such stuff, and it’s kinda bothering me now, not alot just a bit. Also after all these years i feel like i am making all this up and it is in my mind, like a bad dream or something, idk what it is actually,
Also as a kid i believed all this stuff was normal until I realised maybe not..
 anyways have a good day! Thank you

"ive never thought my dad was doing anything wrong i always thought it was very normal but the more other people vent to me about their abuse, the more im starting to belive it might be, but at the same time i feel like abuse is too strong of a word for it esp since i have friends who have experienced way way worse than this

its not very severe or anything he has never hit or punched or kicked me, but he has repeatedly throughout my childhood told me and threatened about how he can break all the bones in my body if he wanted to, often while tightly gripping my wrist to prove a point i think? he gripped it so it hurt on purpose he knew well it hurt and i told him it hurt and tried telling him to let me go and he didnt

i didnt get a diagnosis of asd until june this year but he also grabbed my face to make me make eyecontact with him even though i am autistic and ive never been able to make eyecontact i hate it ive always hated it and now im always conflicted between looking at peoples eyes or not because it makes me really uncomfortable i dont like it at all but i feel like i have to and it stresses me out a lot

he has also multiple times pushed me around when ive had an pretty obvious autistic shutdown but again he didnt know it was autism at the time

whenever i tried to speak against him even when he wasnt mad and when he was mad he has spoken above me and interrupted me and often ended up screaming at me even if its just something normal topic

he multiple times held me down on the floor to make me listen to him and not leave

shaking my body rough

this only happened once but when me and my brother shared one room my brother talked to me a lot and i told him to go to bed and my dad got angry and stormed in and pulled me down from my bed down on the floor so my body got scraped and bruised
(our beds are build on the walls so they are pretty high, he is about 2 meters and it is taller than him

i didnt write this for pity i just want a straight answer please

sorry if my english is bad"
"I am 16 years old and it was never easy growing up with my stepfather. He abused me and beat me regularly when I was growing up. But 3 years ago he sexually assaulted me and tried to rape me several times. My mom, who worships him, didn't leave him. Over those 3 years I have built up a disgusting amount of anger. For the past 2 weeks I have been thinking of killing him. Every time he tries to hit my brother, me or my mom, I stop him by pulling out a knife. I think it's because he beat me up so bad 2 weeks ago that I will never let him get to me again. He's dirt. And if he ever comes near me again, I swear to God. Also my mother disgusts me because she keeps kissing and sleeping with him. Sleeps in the same bed. Even though I will always protect her, I will never love her again. How do I control this anger and disgust?"

"My nightmare is of one of my siblings dying and me being unable to protect them like I am supposed to as an older sibling. I have this nightmare every now and then. I usually never have bad dreams, but when I do this is the one I get."
"So yeah. My mom always has been emotionally abusive, forced me into religions and insulted me a lot. My dad? He's greedy as heck. He can't even buy a few pieces of clothing to an important event coming up without looking for cheaper options. Unlike my mom, dad actually helped me a lot. He buys me books, only books without hesitation and feels grateful for me for not asking for a lot unlike my brothers. (That was 3 ford's in one sentence, it doesn't feel grammatically correct at all)
My mom always insults me whenever she has the chance. My hair is a bit dirty because I've been feeling depressed and tired for a few days? ""How are you my daughter? You sure your brain is attached? Your hair is disgusting. I'm being honest, __.""
My outfit doesn't fit her fashion sense? ""What kind of a girl are you? Change, I gave birth to you and you belong to me."" And shit like those

Sure, she cared about education - religious education. I went to a strictly Islamic school almost my entire life. I'm an atheist, trans and bi guy so yeah I was surrounded by girls the entire time which was awkward. The general education was way better than public schools. She also made sure I got anything I needed which I'm extremely grateful of. She treats me like a doll, sure but I'm grateful for her giving me a great education and 3 life time friends. 
My dad and she got in an argument today. She's leaving back to Uzbekistan. My little brother, who's autistic, is going in a depressive episode. He basically shut down, laid down and didn't respond to anything but just draw something on his phone. I'm scared for him, I already texted my older brother he said he'll help as soon as he gets back. Our mom? She doesn't give a fuck. She says we're ""blood-traitors"" that doesn't feel grateful for her. 
I'm feeling numb and scared for my brother. What do I even do?

"So I have an emotional abusive dad I don’t really wanna go into the details but basically my parents had a horrible divorce and I was caught in the middle and somehow this awful man was able to get full custody of me. (Probably through lies and manipulation) he always would tell me things as a kid as fact, like: your mother is an abusive monster, you don’t really have a mother, we are two peas in a pod, I’m always there for you, I’m your support system. All of these things I realized was a way to isolate me and control me. This dawned on me after my dad having a mood swing (he always has mood swings where he makes and excuse that it was ok for him to treat me that way because xyz.. usually in relation to oh.. well I was in pain, or oh I wasent feeling well, or oh I was tired.) he called me “bad dog” for staying up late keep in mind I’m 19 and completely able to do as I please as a legal adult and while yes I shouldn’t be staying up late my sleep schedule is not the best because my mental health has been all over the place and I’m struggling with untreated mental health conditions I’m working to treat hopefully. And if you’re asking why is a 19 year old still living with their parent? I’m possibly disabled (I say possibly because I haven’t been able to get diagnosed due to no access to medical care until recently) and unemployed due to zero job experience and having physical limitations, I’m hoping to get into collage soon but I just needed a break year for my mental health. So back to what I was saying hearing my dad call me “bag dog” brought me back to all the times when I was a kid where when I did anything he didn’t like or if I misbehaved or questioned him he would call me “bad dog” and how dehumanizing it felt I of course didn’t know the words for it as a 7 year old but it’s just shocking to me that he would do stuff like that and then turn around and be like “I’m your only solid support, everyone else is supporting you to but I’m your number one supporter” and then belittle every other support I had that didn’t fit his rhetoric. I just can’t wrap my head around why he would do that I mean I get that he wanted to control me but it just creeps me out and made me realize how controlling and possessive my dad really is over me and I’m just in a bit of shock and idk what to do I really want to get my own apartment and get the fuck away from him but I’m unable to do so at the moment and it’s terrifying I’m scared of him and now anytime he makes a movement I’m tense and I prepare myself to deal with his bullshit and I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t take it anymore. I just idk what to do or what to think. I’d really appreciate some outside perspectives on this. (Also just so it’s known this is the very tip of the iceberg with how awful and creepy my dad can be this post could be endless if I tryed to cover it all haha i just wanted that to be known cuz idk how this post may seem from the outside but it’s been a long time coming in my opinion.)"
"So my parents were extremely emotionally abusive and ruined my life as a young adult by lying to the entire community about me.... Now I'm in my 30's and have gotten injured so much that I am basically completely disabled... And I have no where else to turn until I can get disability... If that even happens... So I may be forced to move back in with them. 

Can anyone offer me any motivation or suggestions or anything I am feeling very lost and scared about this step in my life.... "
"Even though I'm a woman I wish I could've had a real dad.

My lack of a real 'father' figure genuinely bothers me. 

I (28 TF) am a woman, not a man. I've been transitioned for a couple years now (MtF). And NO, having a weak father is not what made me trans. I've had female inclination in my brain structure since I was like in kindergarten.  And no, no one 'touched me' either. Despite the fact that I am a woman, I still spent 26 years, being socialized, trying my best to be, and being perceived, as a man. I used to look up to my father, for his work ethic, his honesty, and his devotion to my mother. I would harrowingly and brutally, find out he was actually a liar, an adulterer, and upon reflection, I realized he never really was there for me,  or my brothers. I distinctly remember having to teach myself how to tie a tie before my first job interview, using a YouTube instructional video. Everything I learned about fixing cars (not that that is an inherently male trait), I learned either from my older brother (33 M), or from work experience as I used to sell and work with auto parts professionally. 


Now the car thing is understandable as I never expressed ANY interest in working on mechanics or in engineering.  I was always more into philosophy,  history, art, fashion, political science, nerd stuff like comics and books and cartoons. Things of that nature. Which are not gender specific things btw. I learned how to fight (which toxic as some may think, is a genuine important part of being a man unfortunately) , from again having brothers, having friends who studied MMA, and from dangerous street fights (this last one sounds cool, but was not, I had to go through alot of therapy to undo some damage done to me from having these too young). He taught me how to throw a ball i guess, and I even was on a baseball team for a season as a kid, and we were second in our division (otherwise known as the team that lost to the team that would go on to state). 


Sports i always had a passive appreciation of, and I did enjoy the experience but tbh sports were also not my Forte.  Now I have a cellular disease known as 'mitochondrial' disease. So I also spent alot of time in and out of a wheelchair as a kid. I would get substantially healthier as a teen. But I never had any genuine instruction from my father on ""manhood"", hell my brother gave me 'the talk' before my dad did. One thing I always respected about him though was his morals he would espouse to believe in. The fact he worked alot. And that when I had my first girlfriend he didnt objectify the concept, he said "" Just be sure to treat her like a proper lady.""  And now, I'm gay. As a woman I mean. Transbian is what the term is. Which was one of the reasons I struggled to realize I was trans. But again when push came to shove, I realized, post transition.


 He wasn't really honest. I knew it would've been a stretch to get him on board with my transition as he's a DEVOUT RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE,  however, believe it or not I'm still a Christian myself, obviously more progressive in doctrinal understanding, but I would end up going to seminary and getting several study certificates, 


 I am also now a legally ordained non denominational Christian minister, and currently study Christian topics at Yale online.  Gearing up for a big ""showdown of theology"" when I first came out, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find he said "" Well I Accept you, umm, are you a Christian still? Not to be rude, are you a 'full bore woman' now? (Asking if I 'had the surgery' or not).""  And I answered accurately "" Not that its anyone's business, but I have not had any operations, no. (at the time was true), and i still believe in Jesus, yes. "" Some remarks here and there would be not fully 'PC', but I would tolerate in patience,  he invited me to study the Bible with him, a chance I jumped on as, im sure its obvious from my disclosure that I'm a minister, but theology and biblical study are a shared special interest of him and I, so I thought he was being genuine, and naively let my gaurd down. Now he did this thing whilst we studied where he would ""accidently "" misgender me and or deadname me.



 I would always just very politely, correct him. He would say sorry and then seemingly get better and try. However there was a pattern, he would do the exact same process of slipping in my deadname and old gender, and I am not stupid, so I asked him one day. "" Dad, you don't think this Bible study is going to magically make me detransition right?"" And halfway still believing, optimistically, that I WAS maybe imagining the pattern, I was promptly disapointed and honestly,  heartshattered. When he said

 "" Well, I can't confirm or deny that, I want what God wants, son."" I held my wits and emotions together,  and corrected him again. "" It would be daughter not son, and I honestly don't think we should continue with the study. I thought you wanted to reconnect. And admit it or not, you had other motives."" He apologized and simply


 said "" Well the offer still stands. "" Barely acknowledging what he was trying to do. I Had gone on with an optimistic hope, but a now validated reserved approach to my dad. For further context if you are wondering, my mother passed, it was the spark that made me fully realize I needed to transition. And Mind you, myself and my partner at the time paid for her funeral. I waited until she was cremated and memorialized before coming out to the rest of my family, I even gave them all one last Christmas with the old me. And As fate would have it, the year I came out, was the year the Cincinnati Bengals would go to the super bowl. The Bengals are my dad's favorite football team.


 I went with him, when neither of my brothers would, to his little sports bar he began hanging out in, and I gave him that shared experience,  to watch his team, with his ""son"", I didnt say anything, but in my head that was my old self's personal goodbye to him as a father/son dynamic. Despite these things, my father didn't care, a following Sunday, the ""church"" he attends (will elaborate on why its in quotations later), after the Bible study attack had failed to ""convert"" me back to ""normal"", I tuned in to his ""church"" livestreams, because A, I wanted to know what they were preaching, and B, I still wanted some connection to him. To my horror, the ""Pastor"", Dropped my deadname and demanded the congregation ""pray for his salvation"", in reference to me. That was at the time, the final straw, and I texted my father a long, respectful, but stern letter, explaining I was going to be no contact with him for awhile.


 Now as fate would have it, my partner at the time would turn abusive, at one point even brutally beating me (I have documentation of this), i was homeless, and the only place left would end up being his property. I had explained to him that the ONLY THING I would need of him, would be to respect my pronouns and name. Which btw is my birth name, because I was a man they all pronounced it different but my mother always intended for it to be pronounced how I pronounce it now anyways I only legally changed my dead middle name to Ann, after my grandma as my dead middle name was after my grandpa . 



So all in all not even hard to do. Long story short, he would kick me out, and I was on my own completely. In this time frame I had become ordained, and received seminary training. In a scathing falling out argument we had, I had given him several resources about LGBTQ stuff,  in order to help him understand. I was INCREDIBLY patient. He one day retorted ALL OF MY EFFORTS  with a simple "" Well none of those studies are Christian specific, so I don't care about them. "" So I as a Christian took up the challenge,  I gave him articles written by affirming modern day reformation leaders, Books written by affirming Protestant Reverends, YouTube channels ran by affirming Pastors, and even my own tidbits I had discovered about translation,  after receiving my Art of biblical words Certification.  I would find out later, he never even opened any of them. He was set in his way. For no reason. I remember one line "" Even if they don't specifically condemn it, they do in fact, not explicitly affirm it either. So I'll NEVER accept it."" He said a plethora of really disgusting things to me as well in regards to my transness, and he seemed angry that I thought I could somehow call myself a Christian. During my time being homeless again. I would, whilst doing independent denominational research,  browse my dad's ""church"" which I was partially raised in, into my denominational searching methods. To discover they are a prosperity gospel heretical, finacial scamming, controlling, cult, which is HEAVILLY documented, and even was attached to a deadly trucking attack in Australia, and was covered by both ABC news and 60 minutes. I am eternally grateful that I was not baptized in them, I later would become consecrated to the lord, via being publicly baptized in an ELCA Lutheran Church, and I have undergone extensive therapy to undo the damage the cult rhetoric did to my psyche. 





So anyways I would find out from my younger brother (M 23), that my father had cheated on our mother while she was alive, paired with him lying about ever honestly interacting with my research I FREELY labored for to share with him, my entire image of him is shattered. And now those other things I mentioned, are glaringly more obvious. He never, taught me how to be a man. I am not a man, and again him being a poor excuse of a father, is not at all why I transitioned,  I literally am medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria, but I still am deeply hurt and saddened, by the fact my ""dad"" is a truly horrid parent.




Other things that would come to light would be the beatings I used to remember as well deserved discipline,  were actually all child abuse, and often, were being done because we broke rules that were arbitrarily given based on his belief that, similar to the cult, otherwise completely harmless items, content, or media, were somehow witchcraft or demonically possessed. Certain things he thought as such about, were ""The dark knight"" batman movie, as the cult had a theory that Heather Ledger was possessed by a ""joker spirit"" demon, and thats why he sadly overdosed, any non critical mention of any apocryphal texts (which again i freely acknowledge as non Canon as a protestant myself), the TV show modern family, as it encouraged, ""queers"", as lgbtq folks are another topic the cult is insanely hateful of,  I remember that until highschool I wasn't even allowed to call Halloween, Halloween, my older brother had to beg to allow myself and my younger brother a chance to celebrate it, and he did as such, by having to write a report on the true orgins of Halloween. 


To my horror, after my dear mother passed, he has gone unchallenged, as she used to often push back on him, he now doesn't even watch TV news. He only consumes cult approved content, Christian youtubers (a subject i actually also consume), sports,  and Bible readings.  He rejects anything that counteracts the cult specific interpretations of scripture, he told my little brother he was ""never going to see his mother again"" and that ""Jesus told him he was evil"". The damage of being raised by such a man is still present. "
"When I was 14 and younger, my dad would frequently beat me up/kick me out of the house/impose his religious muslim rules on me/curse me out. Now I’m 16 and since we don’t interact much he only keeps it to the verbal abuse. Always telling me how i’m not worth anything and I’m a “good for nothing” daughter. It really hurts me when I see other girls my age have such kind and caring fathers. I feel like he has shattered my confidence so deeply that I’m a shell of a person. I always wondered how many others girls my age had fathers who would punch them or backhand them for minor inconveniences at the age of 9. Sometimes i find myself wishing that he dies so i can finally be at peace and not afraid of him. 

I’m going to be a junior this year and I wanted to apply to really good colleges but because of him I fell into such severe depression that now I’m a pretty average student with no extracurriculars. I can’t get a part time job right now because of my visa status so i have to rely on him for money. i really want my life to get better. does anyone know what to do? "
"The more I look back at my childhood the more I come to hate my Dad. Like he's already an asshole in the present but looking back to when I was like 8-12 just makes me realize how fucked up things around me were.

It all started after my parents divorced. My only memories of him during that time was when he'd take to places like gas stations at 11pm-12amish which I was definitely to young for. I'd go with him cause I was just a kid who wanted to spend time with her Dad. Anyways he'd leave me alone in the car while he ran into the store to get whatever. And during the car ride he'd just vent to me about how my Mom apparently did him wrong during the divorce (and of course it was all her fault, he can never take accountability for anything). Since I was a naive kid I took his word and it ended up as anger and resentment towards my Mom. Even if my Mom tried to give her side, he'd call her a liar and blah blah blah. 

It's also just a bunch of small things that add up over time. Like him constantly being asleep or out whenever I needed him for something. Or him just using/taking things without my permission. For example, I used to keep a jar a coins for when we'd play card games that involved small bets. One day I get over to his house to find out he's taken all of the coins outta the jar to buy cigars. He gave me 20$ in return but I really didn't care about how much money he took. It was one of the last straws of my already decreasing trust. 

Ya know I'm told that I should be lucky to still have my Dad in my life but he hasn't been an actual Father Figure in years. I find myself wishing I could cut him out of my life, but I'm still a couple years short before I turn 18 and can leave on my own.

"
I decided over 1 year ago to go no contact with my father as he was abusive during my childhood. I knew doing this there was a very likely chance he wouldn't try to repare the relationship and just go along with the no contact. Since this he has gotten engaged and I was a little surprised that he didn't try contact me to inform me. Today my grandma ran into him and was talking to him and he didn't ask her how me or my sister were. I feel unwanted even though I was the one to initiate the no contact 
"So I'm 15f am the youngest girl of 6 kids 4 girls 2 boys, I live with my youngest brother 21m and my dad 50m, for context most of my siblings have different moms beside me and my brother 21m, our mom has lived in New York for the past 12 and a half years, we've been raised by our dad in texas, my brother has a job but has only had it for a year and before that he did nothing, he finish high school at 19 and took a year off after, I'm going into my sophomore year in a couple weeks, my dad never gets mad or upset at my brother, I think it's mostly because they look a lot alike and he's the only boy my dad raised, so it's kinda like his only son, I look like my mother and my father hates her, I get yelled at or stuff I didn't even do, I've have been hit a couple times but rarely, and it's mostly just stuff like him saying he's gonna send me to my mom and that I act just like her, he knows I don't like being compared to my mother yet he does it anyways, I know it's not a lot but hes been doing it for years and I just want to know is it abuse"
"I know reddit is the worst place to post about this but I don't know what else to do anymore and I am actively in the situation so I don't have anyone I can turn to.

I am 18, and have left my abusive father's home to live with my mother and grandmother who I thought were better. I was wrong. 

my 7 year old sister has seen and been through hell, and as a result her behavior is very, VERY, bad. and it has only actually happened once (twice in the one sitting) but my grandmother hit her with a plastic spoon

my sister hits, screams, insults, runs away with objects, breaks things, anything you can think of due to the things my MOTHER has put her through. she only hits me though as i am the gentle parent in this situation so to speak and I am also the strictest. i stick to my rules and i never EVER give in to her. ive had people tell me this isn't my responsibility or burden to carry, it's my mother's but I still don't know what to do. 

i don't know what to do, I've explained this isn't okay, I've explained this damages her, I've explained and explained and explained and I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should call CPS because they've already been called twice and they've given her back to my mother who is enabling this behavior both times. the police in our neighborhood won't help, I've tried when enduring my own abuse. 

my sister goes in for therapy on friday which is something I had to pull teeth to put in motion, my mother wants opinions from professionals and I don't know if I should wait for that to happen, call cps, call the police, I don't know what to do anymore I need help please"
"Hello, who ever sees this message will be the first person besides my husband,I’ve ever told about this hell that I’ve endured the last 22 years I’ve been on this earth. I (22 F) came from a pretty shitty household. My father who is very abusive and an addict and my mother who has become abusive and a recovering drug addict, but newly alcoholic. I was SA’ed by my father from my earliest memory in diapers to about 4 years old. I had gotten “too old” for my father’s perverted fantasy. My earliest memory being physically abused, I was about three years old. I was thrown down a flight of stairs and whipped continuously with a wet towel until my mother stepped in and then she was the target of his aggression. Since my mother was so afraid of him, she wouldn’t call the police. For years I had been throw against walls, choke slammed, pinched, verbally abused, sexually exploited, the list could go on and on. I met my husband (24 M) the summer before middle school from my cousin. I would go over to his house almost everyday just to get away from the abuse. I had his mother take me to get on birth control because even though I didn’t know much, I knew I couldn’t bring a child into this living hell. Fast forward to the day after I turned 16. I had came home from my husband’s house. My father already aggravated started on me. Telling me that I was selfish for letting my husband have me all to himself. Calling me a whore, fat, worthless you name it. That day I decided I wasn’t afraid of him anymore. I defended myself and he couldn’t stand that I didn’t fear him anymore. He grabbed me by my hair and throat and slammed me on to the wooden floor. I grabbed whatever I could and bashed him in the face. After he got off me, I started packing all my belongings. We had came to the agreement that if I never told about him SA me or the abuse that he would let me leave. I felt terrible for leaving my mother but I knew that if I didn’t leave that I would die. I moved in with my husband and his family, graduated high school, got a great job, bought a car, and then eventually we bought a house together. Now we are married, we have a son and I have been no contact with my father for 12 months now. If you are in a situation like this now, this is proof that you will make it. THINGS GET BETTER. Lmk if y’all want a part two about my mother.

"After years of trying to communicate the harm they’ve done to me, I’ve finally given up. I don’t feel any sense of remorse or regret or shame. In fact, I feel nothing. I just blocked them and moved about my day. I don’t think they fully understand that I don’t consider them, or think about them; I’ve removed them so much from my life that severing the only line of communication we had was all that I had to do.

I sometimes wish it would have been different; I would have liked to have parents who loved and respected me, but they can’t change. They’re so hellbent on denying the abuse; so determined to pretend none of it happened. They’re so pathetic, really. Then again, seeing what raised them, I shouldn’t be too surprised. The apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Their loss, though. I have a partner who loves me and friends who love me. I’m happy where I’m at. I don’t need anything from them.  

C’est la vie."
"f15, I don’t want to live with my family anymore and I don’t know whether I should leave or not. For as long as I can remember there has been yelling all the time and I don’t feel safe living with them but I also feel guilty if I leave. An organisation offered to give me a place to live, Should I wait 3 more years to legally move out without causing drama in my family or move out now?"
"My dad genuinely is not capable of having feelings, empathy, or sympathy for starters. But our whole relationship (I’m 25F and he’s 58M) is so surface level and transactional. For example I’m in AZ where it’s 115 degrees outside and my power went out… my dad said i could come over until it came back on ONLY if i brought him a cheeseburger?? Then i said No and he said “then don’t come”. 
Or he will only do something for me if I do something for him. He will only pick me up milk from the store if i clean his house or truck. Nothing is ever just a nice gesture. 
For me, He’s my dad so I would clean his house if he needed me too anyways for nothing in return. But it’s always a catch with him.
If he ever offers to do something later on in life he will hold it against you like “well I did this for you so now you need to do this for me or pay me back somehow.” 
Just so irritating how people can’t do things out of goodness in their hearts anymore. "

So I’m trying to figure out if what I experienced within my family was sexual abuse. For context my mom was a stripper all throughout my childhood. Her father, ran and managed most of the clubs she worked at ( not all, but enough). When I was a child and teen I remember my mom being naked most of the time. She was under a blanket but it was apparent she was nude. Once when she was drunk and had hurt herself she needed my help to get into bed, she had taken all her clothes off and then sneered at me and told me not to look at her and called me a pervert- I wasn’t looked by the way, I was just trying to help my drunk naked mom into bed at 13. There were times when she would make comments about my developing breasts and poke them and laugh and giggle despite me expressing I didn’t like it. It felt like she was trying to embarrass me. There was also at least one occasion where she barged into the bathroom and took a photo of me naked as I was getting into the shower and again laughed and joked about it ( and had that photo developed.) Her and my grandfather also would make inappropriate sexual jokes and comments (not together or at each other just in general). Also, less conspicuous I guess but she would lick and suck on my step dad’s tongue in front of us and then laugh when I was grossed out by it. 

My grandfather would make the worst and most sexual comments and talk about bending women over and making grunting sexual noises. He would also talk about how frequently him and his wife had sex and things like that. All of this was just so normal that even now in my 30’s I’m just starting to question these things. And figure out how to define them. I truly don’t think my mom at least got any sexual gratification from these things it was more to humiliate and embarrass me and she was incredibly immature in a lot of ways so it feels very gray to me.

"So i have been sick all day today with light fever and a cold and a shit load of body ache. My mom was out at the parlor all day and asked me to go get my little sister from school even tho  im sick btw she didnt know cause she didnt bother to ask duh, i  ask her to make me a drink to make me feel better ans so she does. When she comes in my room, she screams at me and threatens to throw the boiling hot  drink on me and guess why? cause my lights are not turned on properly therefore im not studying ( my head hurts and so i kept the lights down low and have been doing maths for the last 3 hours even tho i  dont feel good) we argue for a bit and once she leaves i start crying. Now i have a major headache and my eye hurts more and i  didnt want to bother my friend so im writing this ( may i remind you i turned 15 2 weeks ago)"
"My father (single parent) has raised me all his life, my mother was never in the picture. All my life he has been controlling me and telling me how to live my life, not to mention the physical and mental abuse he has inflicted on me when i was a child. My father is an alcoholic for years now and his entire brain is wired differently, he‘s not capable to see someone else’s point or understanding. I am 21 (F) and I still live with him. There is some type of Co-Dependency between us. He always told me how he wants me to dress, how he wants me to wear my hair, what kind of man I should marry in the future and how I should name my children. I am aware that he is probably a narcissist or some of the sort, because if I don‘t end up marrying the kind of man he chooses for me, he will be „heartbroken“. He has a victim complex and doesn‘t respect my feelings or my thoughts. I have tried to communicate alot of it with him. I have tried to explain to him that I am my own person and that me cutting my hair doesn‘t make me a bad daughter just because he doesn‘t like it, but he never listens. I‘ve repeated myself multiple times but there‘s no use to it. I don‘t have any siblings, so moving out is not an option for me currently. My father is very depressed and doesn‘t see a reason to keep on living, except me. I don‘t know what to do. He is the reason why I go to therapy and have so many mental issues but he is also my best friend. 

I wish I could just hate him but all I feel for him is pity and alot of guilt if I think of leaving him all alone on his own.

"Just a rant.

A few days ago I was sent to my grandmothers apartment in New York to watch her after eye surgery since my uncle usually gets off work at late times and is unable to care for her to his full capacity. 

I was hesitant at first but after a few days of staying here I felt so free. My parents, two ivy league students have been very pushy about this college application process even though I know I don't have the grades or skills to get into any of their dream schools for me. 

I don’t know where im going with this but this whole trip just gave me so many opportunities to do teenage things. I was finally able to call my boyfriend and friends, not hear my parents screaming and cursing at one another, and I didn’t have to deal with my dad yelling and threatening me. It felt so nice. 

Maybe im not a victim of anything, maybe im just over exaggerating and begging for attention but when my mom came over to take me back home my body went hot and i completely lost it. I literally feel like im going to pass out. I can’t go back. I don’t want to. But I realized that if I don’t my dad would lose it and he’d argue with my mom or call me just to berate me even more. 

I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I could tell my boyfriend. I wish highschool was over so I’d never have to see my dad again. I wish I didn’t have to accept the reality of this situation and just say “im not going!” and run away from all my problems. Too bad I can’t lol."
"I'm crying in my room right now after being yelled at through the wall. I have IBS and been having a flare up for 2 days now. I had diarrhea all day long and multiple stomach cramps, making it more comfortable for me to lay in bed and distract myself from being on my laptop as well as doing school work online. He has IBS himself so it is not like he's uneducated. 

It began when I was sitting in my room, listening to Johnnie Guilbert songs when I heard him call out saying I need to walk the dogs, He knew I was having a rough day w/ pain and diarrhea however he still asked. When I said I couldn't be because I had  diarrhea and pain meaning I couldn't risk having a bad accident. I could hear him yelling 'For fuck sake, Fine them. Me and ur Mom will walk them' (Roughly, I can remember). Now-I know I sound like a brat but hear me out, He was yelling it aggressively not like a 'OK, We'll walk them' .

He's been guilt tripping me and my mom for years, I feel insanely uncomfortable around him since when he would get mad and begin screaming which I would end up sobbing, If I began sobbing he would get even more mad. M friends say I have massive father issues but I think I'm being dramatic since abuse is physical. 

As If my mental health was crap to begin with. "
"Hi. I've been dealing with guilt and grief because I leave in 2 months. I love my family, but they are so abusive. They've been acting super nice and sweet because I think they know I'm about to be 18, but as soon as they get reassurance they have me locked down I know they'll be back to it just like they do my brother. I've been planning leaving since May 2023. I have an entire plan but I'm getting the anxiety and guilt here and there. I want to be free so badly. But I still have guilt and grief about it because I don't want to hurt them despite all they've don't to me. Help?"
"I read a quote that said “having an abusive parent that breaks their back to provide for you is SO tumultuous like how can i hate you when you built a life for me from dust but also how can i not when you've hurt me so badly” and it stuck with me. 

You are ungrateful if you leave but cry everyday because home doesn’t feel like home at all. You are unhappy then, you are unhappy now. Idk how to deal with this because people tell you that you are exaggerating because all your needs are getting fulfilled but but what about the constant comparison with my older sister, what about the backhanded comments, what about the insult in front of others, and what about no freedom and making every important decision for me. The idea of death feels more alive."
"For context my cousin is 21 and I’m 24, for as long as I remember when visiting my cousin and family she and her sisters were always yelled and always hit by their mother. The oldest of the three is getting the brunt of it, whether she did anything or not her mother yells and hits her. It’s been getting worse as she gets older with her mother breaking her nose, stepping on her head, and causing her face to get scratched. It got so bad 1 time that her younger sister got involved in a very bad fight that her heart stopped and the ambulance had to be called to get her heart moving again.

Recently my cousin (21) broke up with her idiot cheating boyfriend and her mom is trying to get the two of them back together. I don’t know why her mom is so persistent with her to be with this guy. In her eyes because he “ doesn’t do” drugs, smokes, gambles, comes from “rich” family, etc that she should give this cheating scumbag a second chance. It’s gotten to the point that she is constantly calling her, following her, and not allowing her to hang out with her friends, go to her friends wedding and so on and so forth. Complete isolation bar family.

My uncle is basically never home due to his job where he is constantly driving and when he gets home he is so exhausted that all he has the energy for is to eat and sleep. My grandmother is the one who fiercely protects her like a shield otherwise her mother would do worse things.

I suggested calling the police, however she lives in a country where reputation is extremely important and calling the police would damage the family’s reputation severely. I suggested getting a job but she said that her mother wouldn’t allow it. I also suggested for her to stay with our grandparents as they have more than enough space, but she said that her mother wouldn’t allow it and would hit her and force her to come back home.

She is so done and she wants to get as far away as possible from her mother. She wants to cut contact completely. She has no idea how she can escape from her clutches. One of her ideas is to get married, and/or leave the country completely. 

At this point she doesn’t know what to do and I have no idea how to help her 🥺. Please help🙏"
"she's never on my side. she tells me im mean to her, manipulative, spoiled, criticizes my appearance, etc... she also pulls my hair and hits me sometimes. she defends my 25 y/o brother who hits me frequently and gets mad when i dont like her abusive boyfriend. she drinks a lot and plays music so loud my room shakes."
"I (f20) am no contact with my dad. It's been about a year since we spoke. The only contact we have is me and him telling our mom to tell each other that we're watching the horror flick we watch every year on father's day. 

He never treated me with love and respect. That's all I need to say. 

I keep finding myself looking for a ""new dad"". He was always there. I don't want to feel like this. All of my friends' dad's seem like applicants rather than acquaintances. How do I stop feeling that I need my dad?"

"I (26 F) am engaged to my fiancé (31M). first I just want to say that my fiancé is the most wonderful man I've ever met. He treats me like a Queen. I already had 2 kids from my previous relationship when we met. And he has taken the role of their father and treats them like his own and now we have a little boy of our own who he is also wonderful with.  With that being said his mother on the other hand is an honest-to-God, horrible person. SO has a twin brother (J) as well as a younger brother who is about five years younger than the twins. ML has always made it perfectly obvious that the youngest child was her favorite going as far as buying him better things than the twins and not punishing him for the same thing that she would punish the twins for. Since I have known my fiance , there has been multiple occasions where his mother has called him up to cuss him out for some of the dumbest reasons , one being that he was friends on facebook with his father's new wife. And called him a bad son and a traitor. She also told my SO that when his father got diagnosed with brain cancer that it was karma for leaving her. His father ended up passing about a year later.  She even went as far as calling him to cuss him out for not wishing his younger brother a happy birthday. His mother only speaks Spanish and I only speak english, so she has never directly said anything to me but pretty much everybody has the same opinion about her and the things she says. I've never really liked the woman because of all the things my SO told me she's done and said to him , but i've always been kind to her for his sake. But after this weekend I can honestly say. I do not like this woman at ALL. This last weekend was supposed to be a really fun weekend. It was me and my fiancé's sons' first birthday as well as his twin brothers sons first birthday. They were born 10 days apart. So we were doing a joint birthday party for them.  ML came into town to celebrate their birthdays together with us. But the entire weekend ended up being a shit show and  really showed her true colors. Me and my fiance drove the two hours to (J) And wife's (A) house. When we got there, there was a woman there who ended up being a co-worker of J's.
 She was in a domestic violence situation. And J and A decided to allow her to stay a couple days until she could figure out a new living situation. When ML got into town, she immediately wanted to go get her nails done. J And A took the Coworker to the Police station to file restraining order as well as get her things from her house in a safe manner. This was all last minute and was not planned. When ML found out about the woman staying in the house. She chewed J and A out and told them that it's stupid to let someone stay there and that she was supposed to be there to hang out with them and now she couldn't do that because there was another woman there.  ( Coworker stayed in the extra room the entire time except to use the bathroom and eat)  She went on to completely ignore J and A for the rest of the day and most of the next day. She ended up calling  SO and lying and telling him that J and A were the ones ignoring her.  They offered to take her to the mall, as well as a couple other places she refused every single one. We also asked about a few places we thought she might enjoy. She also said no to those but then got mad that she was just sitting in the house with nothing to do and said instead of asking her we should just plan something and do it. A Also spent all day making a delicious dinner of ribs, corn on the cob and also some mashed potatoes. ML tried the food and said that the ribs were too cold And that she didn't like mashed potatoes and was angry that there was no Rice available. She refused to eat and stomped off to the room she was staying in and locked yourself in there. The food was not cold and was delicious, by the way.  Me and A ended up taking a drive. And she confided in me that she had never been so disrespected in her own home before and was very angry about the situation. She broke down crying, saying that she wasnt even comfortable being at home because of the way ML was acting. It was supposed to be a fun weekend to celebrate ours boys,  that ended up just turning out horrible. We did all end up doing a couple of things but it still wasn't as fun as we imagined it would be in the beginning because everything else had already happened. And A especially was super depressed the entire weekend because of how she had been treated by ML. I have tried to talk to my fiancé about the situation and explain to him how her treatment of him and his brother is wrong. He told me that it didn't bother him, that he was used to it and that if anything it made him tough because nothing anybody said in life could hurt his feelings because it had already been said by his own mother. It broke my heart hearing that because he is the sweetest man I've ever met. And he does not deserve to be treated the way him and his brother have been treated their entire life. I told him he needed to seek therapy for the treatment by his mother and that she had emotionally abused him. But he sees nothing wrong with the way he was treated and doesn't think he needs therapy. I just want to know what I can do to get him to seek the help he needs.  Because I feel like someday he is going to end up breaking down and falling apart because of this. Some of the issues in our own relationship I believe stem from how he was treated by his mother as well. And if theres anyone else on here who is getting treated this way, just know you are not the problem!

"For context im 19f, commuting to college and live with my dad to save money. My parents lived together since I was 6 and I used to legally have to be at a parent’s house for certain days of the week until I turned 18. After turning 18 I stopped going to my mom’s house because it felt a bit uncomfortable there. My mom recently got a boyfriend which would be okay to me except his presence bothers me. My mother was very verbally, physically, and arguably emotionally abusive towards me growing up. By growing up I mean since i could remember, up until now but it has gotten much less severe. My dad was not emotionally there for me and he did occasionally yell at me and physically hit me when I was very young but it was only traumatizing to me one time but he was much less emotional as my mom.

As ive grown up, I realized that maybe my parents want to change to be better. Or theyre not as stressed out enough to let their anger foster that way. My dad has been really chill for a while now and im starting to forgive him as hes shown he truly cares and wants what’s best for me, we have never talked about it but i can sense it. My mom is a different case. My mom has continued the yelling and the randomly getting angry/mean and it genuinely scares me. Its the only thing that can make me lose control of my emotions and just cry. Its not full on screaming anymore, but its definitely sudden anger and belittling. She was not angry at all times during my childhood, I loved when she was happy bc she made me feel loved, she did not hug me or show me  affection but she spent time with me and i enjoyed it. To me, that was love. I know there’s probably a woman very broken in her but I cant let go of the constant fear I feel around her. Its physical fear, and its scary. I fear that the “good” mother will go away and I get “bad” mother that makes me feel so awful. I know I am not the best person either, when you live with anger issues you get anger issues, couple that with religious trauma and discovering my sexuality, i could find myself repeating her anger and arguing with those very close to me. (I am working on myself and getting better and I wasn't nearly as far gone as her). I want to forgive her but this is my predicament. She’s got a new boyfriend that moved in and shes visibly a happier person, at least, to the eye. But she’s kind of cut off my grandparents, who helped her so much as a single parent after having the stability of having a partner. To me, it feels a little icky… but its not my problem, so I feel wrong to foster hatred towards her; maybe they hurt her like she hurt me and that’s why once she was secure, she was done with them.I only know this information because my grandparents call me constantly, asking me about what’s wrong with her and urging me to ask her myself because she has ghosted them. This leads me to believe she truly did not grow and she can turn into “bad” mom real quick, especially if the boyfriend is gone. They have been together for years now, but I am someone that low key does not believe in love (ik working on that) so my fear is consuming me because im afraid they will eventually break up. I dont want to be hurt and disappointed again because every time she showed me kindness,I thought she was turning a new leaf, and every time i was met with heartbreak. With a boyfriend, I now have a measure of when she will go back to “bad” mom. (Forgot to mention, but she also acts mean and belittles me when he is not present but this is only sometimes but not all the time. But she has never acted like that in front of him, also a fear factor!). But she has been acting so nice to me and I just know theres someone who is deeply hurt inside of her but I have just been avoidant/ghosting her subconsciously to protect myself. I hate the feeling of guilt and I also want to protect myself. Any advice? Anyone else have a similar experience? Anything would help really"

"So for context Im F16, I lived with my mom my whole life until 3months ago I moved into an amazing foster home. 
While I stayed w my mom I got abused ALOT through these years. In all ways an can image. 
My mom were never at home, she would work all day bc thats where the money comes. And she would often travel for days to meet up with guys, while I were left home alone, The first time I were only 4years. We also mooved houses about 30times in 12years. We almost never had food, and I would often go hungry. I had never experienced having dinner with people. And my mom never attend things at school , so I would be the only child without parents. 
I had to do all of the chores in a home at a very young age and take care of my siblings as If I were their mother.
When my mom would come home from work she would often be mad. All I can remeber is countless of times where she would hit me, choke me and break up the doors if I even tried to lock them. 
Through all these years she would tell me things a mother shouldnt tell their child. And I thought these things were right and normal.
List of things my mom repetietly would say:
- No one is ever gonna want you
- I do not want you
- I rather wanna die than have you
- You are misreable
- You are weak 
- You never make me happy 
- I wish I never birth you

These are very hurtful things for a child to hear, ecpecially it was for me. Because growing up and I still am a child who were always quiet and never did anything wrong. I never shouted or yelled at anyone.

"My very young sister is being abused and I need advice on how to move forward. I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and perhaps direct me to a better subreddit / give advice on how to deal w this situation. Please read below as details are important.

I'm an adult with an established life who lives ~ 20 mins away from my parents and very young (elementary school aged) sibling. As a child, I experienced mostly emotional abuse (to a pretty severe extent) mostly by my mother. There was  also multiple instances of physical abuse, one instance which left bruise marks on head and arms, exclusively done by father. He also physically abused my mother. I did not have contact with any family members except my parents, so there was no adult around to save me. I called the police on my father a few times but my mother would vouch for him even tho I had photographs of my bruises, so the police never did anything. As I grew up, my father chilled out and we developed a pretty good relationship, while my mother and I continue to have a very bad relationship. my father and I have suspicions that my mother has narcissistic personality disorder, and I myself have been diagnosed with borderline PD. My mother's verbal/emotional abuse has gotten worse (toward my sibling), and she treats my sibling much worse than she ever treated me. She does not abuse me anymore (I have basically completely cut her off). Given that my father had stopped abusing me and my mother, and I saw growth in him, I assumed that he had changed and felt safe leaving my sibling with my parents and moving out to start my own life, assuming he would step in the way I did when I lived at home. However, since I've moved out, my sibling has been telling me about increasingly bad instances of abuse, including my father physically abusing her once very recently. I have no doubt it will only get worse as it's following the exact same pattern as it did when I was younger, but to a greater degree now (she's younger than I was when it started, and my mother is much more abusive to her than she was to me). it's been horrifying seeing the same things that happened to me start happening to her. Naturally I'm extremely worried about her and realize that I am literally the only adult able to help her, and I don't think I could forgive myself if I didn't at least try to gain custody of her so she's away from these monsters. Please note I've started gathering evidence, asking her to take videos of them yelling at her and have taken vids of her telling me about the physical abuse (with her consent). 
Unfortunately, things aren't straightforward, as she ultimately still has deep attachments to her parents (she's very young and they are very good at brushing their abuse under the rug pretending like it's no big deal and having a great day the next day - think of an abusive relationship where love bombing follows the abuse then the cycle repeats). She doesn't want me to take custody of her even though we have a great relationship and I act as a parental figure to her anyways. She's also only a child and certainly unable to understand the ramifications of being abused as a child (I also thought it was horrible but didn't understand how much it fucked me up in the long term until I was much older).
I also am worried about actually having custody as I'm in school for my doctorate and barely have time to exist as-is. However, of course, I would put anything aside to ensure my sibling grows up feeling safe and loved unconditionally.
Lastly, I have a semi-good relationship with my father (he's good when he's not hitting women and children lol) and despite how stupid I feel saying this, I have a SLIVER of hope that maybe with therapy and anger management he may be able to improve that side of him. I am a bit worried about going through a custody battle and losing the last family I have left - him.
I truly don't know what to do. Hearing the stories, watching the videos my sister takes, and knowing this abuse is going on is taking a HUGE toll on me. It's like someone's tying my hands and forcing me to watch my sister be tortured and fucked up for life. She's adamant she doesn't want to separate from her parents, but I feel such a responsibility to do something about this (I'm also about to legally be a mandated reporter once I finish my degree). For now I've asked her to please not share details with me if she doesn't want my help, and to instead just tell me if she needs something physically (for me to pick her up, for me to make her food and drop it off for her if her mom doesn't feed her out of anger, etc.). But i still feel horrible telling a baby that she shouldn't tell me about the abuse she's experiencing (I am getting her a therapist but she can't really talk about the abuse without risking being reported). But I also can't hear it and it's severely impacting my mental health (again, I'm already not doing great given I have borderline personality disorder, and was depressed for most of my life - not anymore, and have had attempts at taking my own life). I truly don't know what to do in this situation, and am afraid to talk to anyone like a lawyer or therapist as they would likely immediately report.

Thank you so much if you read all the way to the end, and please drop any advice you have as I've truly never faced a situation where I've been stumped like this."
"I'm going to be a blunt as possible.  My dad was my abuser and although he isn't in my life anymore (and never will be), I have a hard time dealing with the fact I feel like I need him to pass before I'll get any peace of mind. He has a heart condition and is untreated,  so I find it becoming less and less of a hypothetical everyday,  but I was hoping for any advice or shared experiences to help navigate the following years,  or however long is left in his hour glass "

This absolute Karen literally told a doctor with years of studying and a fucking degree that he doesn’t know shit about his work. According to asshole dumb narcissist father, he has more knowledge than anyone just cuz he watched a few YouTube videos on a certain topic. Dumbass takes my gadgets away then screams and orders me around cuz I’m a “girl”. He doesn’t let me live in peace like never. Always fucking arguing and screaming. Telling me that I’m worthless because I’m not studying all the time when all he does and has been doing for 6 years is laying on the couch watching tv.i can’t concentrate on studying fuck that I can’t concentrate on anything. Whenever I try to do something he interrupts and tries to act as if he knows everything and tries to “correct me”. I fucking hate him so much why doesn’t he just die. Because of him my depression is kicking in and I’m only 16. I need to study to get myself out of her but I can’t even do that because he’s always hovering over me. "
"Hello,
I'm making this post because...well I don't actually know how to explain it because I'm not that good with English but I'd like to hear other people's opinions.


To sum up a long messy story, my mom had a rough childhood in a formerly communist country (she was well of but her mom died know childbirth and she blames her stepmom for a bad childhood but I've spoken to grandpa and step grandma and from their stories I personally think she was always a very angry and lazy person)

There was a whole messy deal when I was born because i was born in her second marriage (she was a bit wild in high-school and got pregnant at 16, she was forced to marry and had a divorce, she had 2 song in her first marriage)


My dads side of the family is poorer (we live in a village and most views are very close minded though because of dads dad who always blew away money and cheated, and from what i heard beat my dead grandma (dads mom) they had a bad reputation, it kinda sticks to you for a while is what I'm saying)
She married him and there they all had a deal that they'd raise the sons from her first marriage but mom got pregnant with me and there was this whole messy fight and I kinda grow up with a dad who'd get really drunk once in a while though he doesn't get angry often he has these massive explosive fits every once in a while and mom who's from what I belive very emotionally underdeveloped and whould always threaten me and beat me (sometimes we get into physical altercations, I just don't want her to keep hitting me and now im big enoughto defend myself)when I was younger. 

Once I started going to high-school I got super paranoid because I was really worried I'd let loose like her, get pregnant and basi stop living (mom and her ex had a joint custody, she had to pay him the child fee {I don't know the correct term sorry} and as a result refused to work and now can't have a credit card because she doesn't want to give the ex any money [I tried telling her to get a protected account but she doesn't want to let even 30% od her pay to go to him and always starts accusing me of hating and not knowing what im saying her when I try talking to her about it)
I just think she's a very bitter creature that's kinda mad I've got a semi normal life? But maybe I'm just a bitch.

My little sister tends to be feisty like her too and very argumentative (but I think that's because she's a teen)

Anyway...that was a long intro and I hope someone will read this through but sometimes I fear that im just like my mom and i hate it, today while I was packing I got really suspicious to leave for a new job when I couldn't find the envelope with some money I got as a gift and got angry at her (maybe I just don't like her but she used to steal the ""support"" money that i was getting for my good grades and would steal the tips I got from my part time job) I didn't blame her because I put a lot of effort in self control but I was angry and nervous and when some is angry with her she's angrier back...so I kinda threw out all the stuff out my suitcase and dug around my whole room. Somehow the envelope was on the floor even though I put it in the drawer (she always says I'm forgetful in this bitchy tone even though I never misplace things when I'm at work for example though I am a scatter brain sometimes)

Now she won't talk to me even though I tried to apologize (I'm usually very easy going with others but everything is a fight with her and she just brings out this anger out of me, I hate her sreaming)

Do you think I'm the problem? I keep thinking I'm the one ruining this family and even now as I write this I feel like I'm lying as I type this out and that I'm trying to get someone on my side)
For reference I'm a girl that just reached 20yo and I'm kind of an odd ball? (Well I think this would be the proper translation of the term in my Language) I'm unsure what to so with myself, don't know shit and don't think i can make it happen. I decided to take a job far away to get away from my hometown and family but like idk I'm afraid that I don't deserve it, please tell me what you think because I don't trust my brain at the moment and don't wanna mentally beat myself down.


But I still think I love them, my country is kinda known for being crazy and poor, so maybe I should just change my outlook on it or something.

Thanks again and sorry for the Grammer I did the best i can"
"My father is emotionally and physically abusive. He would yell threats like I'll break you legs, or tell me things like he and I are both good at taking advantage and lying to other people. Using them to get what we want. Some of the physical stuff he did to me and my siblings like picking me up by my shirt and slamming me against the wall. Or the time where he punched my little brother in the nose and gave him a nosebleed. He is a good kind man who cares I just fear him sometimes. He said he didn't have a father so he struggles to be one. Anyways, back to the title. I used to have nightmares. Of my brothers or my sister dying. Not by my father. But just dying. I dreamed that I was helpless and I was crying. These dreams continued for a while and then they stopped. They reappeared at other times as well. I think it's because as the oldest I am required to protect my siblings. These thoughts are physically painful.These thoughts and other things are weighing on my mind and twisting it every single day. You do not want to know the stuff that goes on in my head these days. It feels like my mind is getting worse and worse. I can go to no one. I've become a cold uncaring lier. I find it hard to connect and care for people, like my own siblings. Hopefully my parents don't find out about this post. (They monitor my phone, but I have found some loop holes I am 16m)."

She also told me if I had sex I would also get beat. I would also be grounded for a very long time and life would be over as I knew it.

"# How bad is my situation compared to someone normal?

Last time I posted about my situation on reddit. The title is above here. I posted in it about how my father has abused me a lot in the past. And i didn't wanted to involve police in the matter. But the way he acts is the same, I expected a lot but found that he is manipulative, angry when i disobey or contradicts him, he is not capable of love, he always remind me of how he earned money for me, i tried to fight against him however i can but i never hit him ever. But he always hit me when I disagreed with him and then my family. I tried a lot to get him to change but it's not possible. Now i want to involve law enforcements. I am done with him. I will try to convince my family to report him. But some things to note is that:

He never hit me or anyone since he came to USA.

My family is scared of him.

My cousin is friendly towards him.

I need to get him away from my family once and for all.

Should I call the police.

Will they arrest him without any evidence. I will convince my family to tell the truth for once.

PLEASE HELP ME."
"


Hi All. I came to Reddit to rant/ get clarity as to handle this very very delicate situation. Ever since I was child I was abused by mother like crazy. She would hit me, she would throw cuss words at me and even went to the extent to get support from other members for her shitty ass behavior. 

I realized this was toxic and started taking the help that I need. But even then I have not been able to get over the trauma. 

Couple of years ago I moved out the country but then also she has this control over me. If I put a picture with my boyfriend she asked me to take it down, I wore a dress that showed cleavage, she was after me for months to change my display picture.

Now that I am happy and in a relationship, she is unable to digest that I am happy and she doesn't like the guy at all. I live with him now and she is trying to find out who I live with through my friends. She is really really stressing me out and I am scared the extent she would go to. 

She is someone who can't understand boundaries and needs to prove a point. She is narcissist and toxic af. She is out and about to destroy the relationships that I have with my friends by trying to get them to snitch on me. 

I am really helpless and don't know what to do. 

She is also someone who says "" After all I am your mother"" and gets away with it. "
"Im scared but I can’t go back now
There’s a cps report on the way"
"TW: Self harm, incest, child abuse

I’m an adult male and have a lot of intrusive thoughts about harming myself, issues with intimacy, substance abuse issues, and difficulties with functioning that a lot of people chalk up to autism, although tests don’t show I have autism (some kinds of PTSD can be misdiagnosed as autism). 
As a kid I engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with exclusively male peers, and tried to talk other boys into self-harming themselves in their genital region, which is a recurring intrusive thought for me even today.  

The most suspicious thing is how my father always talked in a very sexually-charged ways. This hyper-sexualized vibe even showed up when my father told me about the “birds and the bees” when I was far too young (maybe 6-7 y/o or younger). I also had not asked about this topic. He told me about “the birds and the bees” in a very graphic way that made me and my mother uncomfortable and continued talking despite my mother chiding him a bit. He also told me within this same conversation about a time where he got a girl drunk and stayed sober himself so he could “feel her up” when she was passed out.
It is really chilling to me that not only did he think it was appropriate to tell a child about sex in a super graphic way, but he also told me about him sexually assaulting somebody. 

My father is also a self admitted porn addict which was very much in my face when I was growing up; there’s even a picture in my baby photo album of my father (clothed) looking at porn with me as newborn sleeping on his shoulder. 
My father once talked about his porn watching habits around the dinner table when I was a teenager, and when my stepsister got super uncomfortable, he laughed off her concerns, and kept talking about it.

Another event was when I was around 8 y/o; my father came home drunk (he was a self described alcoholic) and talked to me a bit and somehow got to straddling me clothed and bouncing up and down on me in a very weird way that I think I registered as being weird even as a kid. 

My father also openly had a “crush” on a 16 y/o girl on a vacation I was with him on when I was around 10. He would take suggestive pictures of her all the time, told the girl’s father in front of me that he had a “crush” on her, and joked to her face about his “crush” on her.

Another reason I think some abuse may have happened to me is some of the aforementioned behavior as a kid. When I was 5-6 I talked a male peer into going into a bathroom and touching each other’s genitalia. Even weirder was a pattern of behavior where I tried to talk male peers into causing themselves pain in their genitalia. 
The first time was when I was maybe 5, and involved me placing objects on a slide so that it would hit my male peers in the balls. I remember referring to this as a “peepee torture” which is just so deeply alarming for such a young child.
Another time I tried to talk my male peer into putting ice in his swim trunks as well as put his genitalia in a jacuzzi pool jet.
Other solo things I did in this vein were tying things to my genitals and tying the other end to an elevator, and closing toys with sharp hinges on my genitals. 
I continue to have a recurring intrusive thought about causing harm to my genitalia. This is extremely alarming to me and some part of my difficulty with intimacy/extreme performance anxiety. 

You may ask what my mother was doing this whole time and the answer is nothing. When I asked her about some of my inappropriate behavior as a child (weird thing to ask my mother but I couldn’t find effective therapy and was doing really badly), and she blurted out that it was normal and told me a terrifying story about an unnamed male child engaging in incest with his sleeping unknowing sister (she told me the sex act the brother did to his sister too), telling me this horrifying story with the subtext of “all kids do weird things.” This story also reveals that my mom doesn’t really think that abuse is a big deal, it’s just a “weird, quirky thing.”

What do you think of this? Does it sounds like something may have happened? Or are my concerns explained some other way?"
"Ok so my relationship is not good with my mother she was never there and has done some stuff which ill not elaborate rn cause thats not the topic of discussion rn, ik she has hurt me and the childhood me in many ways and I recently decided to distance myself from her, but im thinking…. Does forgiveness help… i mean idk 
I know as a fact that i have no energy in my heart left to go back and fix stuff like literally i cant do that to myself anymore so idk can someone just tell me more about forgiveness and healing a relationship"
Is it normal for my mom to hit/tell my 2-1 year old sisters to shut up and she has an extremely short temper and she also stuffs underwear or any piece of cloth she can find when they are crying and she does it rough too or it just looks like it but is it normal??
"Some needed context prior to this incident. When I was in 5th grade, there was this incident where I brought an old phone to class so I could play a game with my friends during recess. My mother allowed me to bring it to school but I think she never brought it up with my dad. Later during the day when my dad arrived home, he called me name and confronted me about it. I responded truthfully and he took out his belt and began beating the shit out of me. I was screaming in pain and shriveled into a ball on the floor. If it wasn't for my sisters intervening, I would've been sent to the hospital. That event left me scarred ever since. I've been avoiding my dad as much as I can since just looking at his face makes my fight or flight response activate. I don't know if it should be labeled as PTSD since I don't want to jump to conclusions.

Now for the incident that happened recently. I was watching my show while eating dinner and my dad just appears out of nowhere and starts bad mouthing it as he does with anything I watch/do. I just sat at the table debating if I should turn it off and leave or just sit there. I came to a conclusion and turned it off since he obviously didn't like the show (which was Haikyuu) and I just went to my room as I was done with my food. A few minutes later he barges in my room and starts yelling at me like ""why'd you turn of the TV why'd you fucking do that"" and I'm shaking and bawling my eyes out as he's yelling at me. He then picked up the mug on my table and threw water on me and just as the title says, he threatened to throw the mug at me. I'm sitting there on my bed having a panic attack and all my dad says is that I shouldn't be crying since he didn't hit me. My mom walks in and just doesn't do anything but when he leaves she just says I shouldn't be crying since I brought this on myself. I don't know if I really did bring this on myself or not."
"I tend to find it extremely easy to emotionally bond with and have empathy for animals, especially cats. But I tend to often find it harder to open myself up in that way to humans.

I suspect this is because, while my parents were often emotionally abusive or neglectful, we had cats. And our cats were always there for me. I always played with them. When I was sad I could cuddle up with them. Stuff like that.

And I have this feeling that cats being this emotionally supportive presence in my life whereas my parents were often not, and sometimes quite the opposite, is what caused me to feel this way about cats compared to humans.

Anyone else have something similar?"
"I genuinely need help. My parents think I’m going insane. Basically I had a lock on my door (it’s one of those metal slidey ones). I say had because my dad has broken two of them and now i use wooded lollipop sticks instead of the metal slider so no one barges in while im changing. 

This may sound narcissistic but Im very smart, I’m the smartest in my grade and I always get perfect scores in tests. I never ask my parents for help regarding school, I don’t have any allergies or phobias and I don’t create a fuss.

Today my dad barged into my room because I was getting stressed about what clothes to wear for an event- it was business casual and I only own hoodies and leggings. He proceeded to scream at me, block my door so I couldn’t leave and threaten to lock me up in a mental asylum. My mum came in and was crying, I started shouting because my room was very messy, I was wearing pyjamas, they weren’t letting me leave, I was on my period so mood swings, I had a migraine etc..

For about an hour they screamed at me and I won’t deny that I screamed back. My mum kept saying that I was “too anxious” over nothing. She’s convinced that I have anxiety and yet they’ve never took me to a therapist or whatever. All my friends with things like that get counselling in school. 

I don’t like celebrations where I’m the centre of attention for example my birthday. I asked if we could just treat my birthday like any regular day this year but they refused. My mum said it was ok and that I didn’t have to do anything and yet today she said that something was wrong with me because I couldn’t even open birthday presents in front of my family. 

I said that I couldn’t look at them the same and that I planned to leave the house as soon as I could and never come back. She started hysterically laughing at me while I was sobbing and said that I was being dramatic. 

Unfortunately I have to live here for three more years, but im going to look into getting emancipated. I’d like to get therapy or something but idk. I feel like i could be way worse, im a perfect student, I barely complain and I get things done. I don’t understand why everyone makes such a huge fuss over me not being social, and not liking attention. Yeah it’s unusual but I don’t think it makes me insane? 

I can’t give much more info for fear of them finding me but I will try answer any questions. I genuinely want people to be honest, if you think I’m a psychopath tell me the truth and tell me what I can do. "
"I have always viewed my mum as safe and like she was going through the same thing as me so it felt like she understood. I have now slowly come to the realisation that she was an adult and I was only a child and she should have protected me against his abuse, she completely ignored the fact he was abusing me and ignored the signs that I was suffering. She saw my self harm and did and said nothing to me as she knew his abuse was the cause and she had no intention of addressing it "
"I am not sure what to do in this situation, I feel so lost and confused and like there is no escape. I just want to let it out, it hurts keeping it as a secret for 20 years. 

My mother and I have always been close, and on a good and normal day when she doesn’t drink, she is my closest friend, almost like the Gilmore Girls. She is very dramatic, eccentric, and childish. However the moment she drinks, she gets extremely violent and says a lot of mean things to me that I am unable to forget, no matter how much time passes or the amount of times she says she is sorry. 

I am a very shy person, who is really quiet. But I also get angry easily and that is because my mom knows all of the trigger words that result in my becoming short tempered, for example blaming me in every situation (we were at the store, she wanted to get a cola but forgot and she blamed me for not reminding her) 

Ever since I was a kid, my mother would turn into an extremely childish person who would want to be in the center of attention after a few drinks and would do silly things, like sing, dance, pee on the floor, etc. I always tried to stop her from the embarrassment or looking like an idiot infront of people, but then she would get focused on me and start to attack me, a lot of times verbally. My moms “abusive” nature would come out even when she doesn’t drink, like if I would spill something she would beat me up, so I would always try to wipe any spills or drops with my sock when I was 4. 

So here a few situations: 

1. My father and mother were arguing, like a usual couple. But my mom would take it in a wrong way and instead of being an adult, she would victimize herself and say that she wasted 20 years of her life on me and him. She would hit my dad and when my dad isn’t at home, she would take it out on me. In one of the instances, she once hit me with a belt and the metal part hit my eye. I had to go to the first day of school with a black eye.

2. Whenever my mom drinks she would say things like “I would have aborted you”, “you have no friends, my teacher tells you how much all of your friends hate you”, “you are an abusive sad person”, “I hate your voice, it is your own fault”, “because of you I wasted 20 years of my life”, “you are loser and you have achieved nothing”. 

3. As a kid, she left me alone with babysitters to go out with her friends to bar or clubs and come back late and pass out. My mother and I didn’t have a relationship whatsoever as a kid, and alot of time I felt as though she resented me. It felt like I had to compete with her for my fathers attention and she would on purpose make me uncomfortable by walking around the house in sexy lingerie or tell me that she wants to have sex with my dad and I have to leave the house. All of that would make me super uncomfortable and as a preteen it made me angry that she would tell me stuff like that, so I fought with her a lot. My dad would side with me, but my mom would say “of course the two of you protect each other, I am alone” type crap. 

4. She would kick me, throw chairs at me, and when I was super mad and took her phone away because she was calling random people to complain about how I am a very bad person, she grabbed a knife and told me to give back her phone. She was extremely drunk then.

5. Every time she would mess up, she would reverse the situation and gaslight me into thinking none of it happened and i imagined it because I am an egotistical person and that I am abusive. After a few rounds of arguments regarding the fact that I am a bad person and she is the victim, she would constantly tell me to come and to hug her and she would say “forget about it, we are both at fault. I love you” but my heart would ache from the pain I had to endure. 

Just last night she came back from a wedding drunk, and we had a very bad fight. She did her usual, do something stupid to make me mad, I get upset and tell her to stop doing something, she verbally insults me, I tell her to go to sleep, I grab her and make her go to her room, she attacked me and I had no sleep,cuz she kept coming to fight. She woke up and blamed me from being physical with her and that she is scared of me. 

What the hell should I do? "

"So I'm not really sure how to word this or what you would consider this but I'm still kind of shaken up but we've been having problems with one of my dogs for a while because he's been obsessed with my smaller dog and barks a lot randomly, the smaller dog is mine but the one we're having trouble with is my parents dog. Their dog started barking and my stepdad got mad so he got up and rushed over at him, he tried to kick him in the side but I think he missed and then said he was gonna start using his shock collar to shock the hell out of him ""just because"" in his own words, i feel sick to my stomach. My stepdad has never been violent to me except verbally when he felt I was being disrespectful but he has with my sister and his dog, I already know I'm gonna get some stuff telling me to reach out to somebody about this but my entire family would deny anything and it would only put me in a bad position. I just want to talk to somebody about this, I feel terrible for not doing anything. I'm sorry if I've come to the wrong place, I don't want to disrupt a community I just don't know."
"I have a situation, a friend of mine F(20), she is and always has been a model student and daughter who always puts her family first and scores the top grades through school and college with her teachers and colleagues singing her praises to her parents.

She is being mistreated by her ungrateful parents who are hell bent on controlling her every living moment and decesion, she has no social life because of them and if once in a blue moon she tries to go out with her friends it becomes into a whole fiasco with her parents and younger brother berating her about how she doesn't care about her family's reputation even though she has never done anything to put even a blemish on it and has only raised it ever since she could think on her own.

Her brother on the other hand who she naively cherishes and would do anything for is an ungrateful son of a bitch who only takes and takes from her, is a failure in every scope of his life takes advantage of her love and makes demands of her like he deserves anything but a slap. Though anychance he gets he creates doubt in her parents mind about her character and how she might be talking to her boyfriend anytime she is on a call or is spending time with him anytime she is even half an hour late to come home from work. 
All he does for her is put fuel in the fire that she is trapped in.

Her parents though act all progressive and liberal about how she is the apple of their eye and how they ask in front of their relatives but in the walls of their own home they threaten her by saying that they will marry her off anytime she does something on her own volition, something that makes her happy and even her brother adds to it and often suggests it himself, they say that she may do anything she likes after she is married off. 
When she says that she has a job a college life that she is committed to they say that it doesn't matter and she can just stop going.

All in all they want to tie her up and never let her leave the house, she is not even able to go at the end of her street without being bombarded by questions.

Her father puts up her every act as a threat to his reputation even though it is her brother who is very well capable and willing to drown it and she has only glorified his so called reputation ever since she was 10. She helped him in his business, taught him how to use his own fucking computer when she was 12 but all of that is either forgotten by them or they don't care and are just ungrateful bastards.

As her friend I want to make them pay, atleast realise what kind of gem their daughter is because I am not kidding or overdoing it one but that she is the kind of daughter people pray for and someday I might too.

Please give me ideas or another way so that I can help this friend of mine."
"So for context my sister lives a few cities away and I live 10 minutes next to my parents. I am always there for them and help them as much as I can. I’ll readily help them whether that’s financially or housework. My mother has recently had surgery and needs help so I spent the day cooking a big batch of food to give to them. It’s not the first time I’ve done that. I tend to help a lot more since my sister hardly comes down to see us. Yesterday my uncle (mum’s brother) his wife and son came to see her. She commented that I’m a good cook however my sister is a better cook since she lives far away. This upset me a lot. Not sure whether it should or not because I don’t felt like she was undermining me. After they left I calmly explained to my parents and their replies were “you act like we should be grateful that you’re here and your sister is not” and also “don’t bother cooking anymore.” I’m not sure where I went wrong or if I was being touchy. Their replies hurt me more rather than understanding that actually they upset their daughter.

"I’m 17 and I really needed to make some money to save up for a car. I sent some applications to a few places but got no answer from any. My mom told me to get a job where she works at so I applied and got the job. During the interview, the manager  slightly mentioned that he knows how hard my mom works (also complimented her on a few other things) and because he knows how hard my mom works he assumed that I will be the same. Though I can agree she’s a hard worker, him praising her really upset me. He praised her on how nice and respectful she was and I couldn’t help but feel awful. I know this might be stupid and he only knows her as a good hardworking employee and not a physically and emotionally abusive mother and I know it’s not his fault but him praising her really just upset me. It just sucks to see her get praised when she’s so awful to me and my siblings.  I know that at work she’s so nice and her coworkers like her but I just can’t wrap my head around the fact that she’s so kind at work and calm but she gets home and gets upset at the smallest reason and starts yelling. I know that it’s dumb for me to get upset knowing that her coworkers have no idea how she really is but I can’t help myself."
"I. 17F, am planning on going abroad for my degree. Not necessarily out of my country but out of my state, in order to pursue psychology as none of the colleges in my town or state are any good for psychology. My parents on the other hand, insist that it is not necessary and that they would miss me when I'm gone. I don't understand why people who have abused me for so long and say they regretted giving birth to me can't think logically whenever it comes to my future. I understand that they'd miss me but isn't it important for me to grow and be independent? Sometimes they're overbearing and other times they're assholes. I don't know how to convince them to go abroad. Esp since they're still deadset on me pursuing medical, even tho I have made it very clear I do not wish to do so. They keep insisting its because my future will be good, filled with money and I'll be successful, even though being happy is also my priority. How do I convince my parents to let me study psychology abroad?"
"So came here to say that when i was 8 yrs old it was my sis birthday and i so wanted to film/record my sis and dad singing happy b-day when i was recording my mom took the record cam out of my hands.

"Before I narrate my experience, I want to clarify that I live in an Asian country where women can’t move out of their homes unless they’re moving ou of city/country or until they get married.

My mother and I were extremely close during my early childhood. Since my birth, my parents had shifted to another city in which we had no family, due to my father’s job. As an only child, I grew extremely comfortable of having only them around and was very attached to both of them. However, even then my mother had always been extremely strict and critical, for example she’d always expect me to be at the top of my class and I remember being scared of not coming first because “what would my mother think of me”. Regardless, I had a very codependent attachment style with her and remember loving her a lot. All of that changed when my father took retirement and we were supposed to shift back to my parents’ previous hometown. 

My mother and I shifted a few months earlier than my dad, and I was only 11 at that time. The only place she could think of staying was at her own parents’ home (who had died), and this is also where her sister resided with her family. We took the upper floor, but my world turned upside down when my mother’s sister started abusing me in every way imaginable (except sexually). Sometimes, she would mock me and ridicule me for my appearance, and when I’d complain, she would beat me up relentlessly. Shoes, belts, slaps, punches, you name it. Other times, she would just call me “disobedient” and use that as an excuse to beat me up. In all of those occasions, my mother never intervened. She never protected me. She never even stepped in and said, “stop what you are doing to my daughter.” She’d just watch me getting beaten up and then later come to me and tell me that “it’s for your own good”. When I’d threaten them that I would call and tell my father, they would lock me up and prevent me from speaking to him. All of my calls with him would be monitored, in fact, whenever my father’s siblings would visit and we would visit them, I’d be told to not tell them anything personal because “we shouldn’t tell anyone what goes on at home. What happens at home is private and can’t be discussed.” Once my father moved in with us, things got better for a while until it started again, in other ways. My father got another job and he’d be away for most of the day. If my aunt wouldn’t hit me, I’d be ridiculed, shamed for absolutely everything, I used to love sketching at the time and she would mock me for being so bad at it and I remember once that she saw a sketch made by me, tore it up, and threw it on the floor, and then she brought the broom, and put it in the trash. I don’t remember sketching after that day. Even during those incidents , my mother never stepped in. Instead, when I’d try to fight for myself, she would scold me and then later force me to apologise to her sister. When my father would step in, he’d get thrashed by my mother. 

A couple of years later, my father bought and built a home for us to move into, and that’s when my nightmare came true. My mother’s sister decided to move in with us. She used the excuse that she had to sell her parents home as my mother wanted her share of the property and somehow she was our responsibility now. My father had absolutely no say in the matter as my mother had made his life hell also. Why he never took a divorce, I will never understand and maybe that’s the only thing I will never forgive him for. In our new home, my aunt tortured me just as much. I was 15 then. Once, when I fought back, she tried to suffocate me with my own pillow. I remember my mother meekly asking her to not to do it. She also scratched me on my face and I remember having a giant scar on my eyebrow, and my mother blackmailed me into not telling anyone why I got it. I don’t understand how or why I obeyed her, but I did. I told no one.

They moved away a couple months after that. It wasn’t because of what she had done to me, but because her husband could finally afford to pay rent in a separate home. The physical abuse stopped and hasn’t happened to this day. She was always a tormentor though, and is to this day. Since my mother is still pretty close to her, she is often visiting our place and sometimes she says or does something because of which I fight back. Even after all these years, my mother never took my side. My relationship with my mother never got fixed because of this. She never defended me, and I will never forgive her for it. 

Last week, an incident occurred because of which I had to intervene and I did so in a very calm manner. Next thing I know, my aunt called, screamed at me and called me names before cutting the calls. I was not at all disrespectful, even though considering the monster she is, I should have been. My mother was listening to all of this and her next move wasn’t at all surprising. She called her sister and started taking her side, and after that call when I screamed at her about her sister being such a monster, my mother had the audacity to scream at me and asked me to shut up.

Since that fight, my mother and I have not spoken. In fact, after pulling verbally abusing me, her sister had the audacity to come over to our place and taunt me again, but this time I was firm and fought back equally, which pissed my mother off even more. What broke my heart most was how my mother was sitting with her sister having coffee, and the only thing I could think of was “I would never sit with my daughter’s abuser, much less give them my time of the day.” 

In previous incidents when something like this occurred, I try my best to communicate with my mother later. I try to tell her how much her actions have traumatised me and how my entire life has been affected by her lack of protecting me, and each time she promises to do better. Either that, or she finds horrible excuses to defend herself or even her sister. If nothing else, she asks me to “forgive and forget.” 

I have been to therapy, and I have tried everything in the book to help myself get through this. I want to break free of this constant pain of feeling unsafe. I have occasional nightmares and wake up crying and screaming, and in all of those nightmares, what hurts more isn’t that my aunt is abusing me, but that my mother never defends me. I cannot move out of the country because my father is old and sick and the only family I really have. I love him enough to give up everything else in the world. But all this pain is making me go insane and I no longer know what to do. I don’t involve my father usually because of his health problems, but when I do, he stands by my side and fights for me, but it is pointless because my mother is extremely controlling and emotionally blackmails everyone. 

I want to clarify that it may seem that my mother is lonely and dependent on her sister, and that is not true. It may also seem that my mother is in an abusive marriage which could explain why she thinks it’s okay to tolerate abuse, and that is also not true. My father, although not the most romantic man on earth, has never even spoken to my mother in a loud tone. He has always been caring, loving, and supportive despite my mother treating him like absolute shit.

"

I am a 14-year-old boy, and my older brother is my favourite, and I had no problem with him. We were very close until he reached the second grade of middle school. Strange things began to appear in his behavior. He treated me like a monster, and he kept hitting and cursing at me. I used to say that this was normal, this was my teenage period, and my mother was like that.   when he reached the third grade of middle school. My fate changed and he started beating me unreasonably, as if I was torturing him the time I reached him. He  broke my leg and my body is all bruised. When one of my friends suddenly says I say don’t know or I fell and he keeps hitting me, he is upset. For example, I am sitting in the safety of God, and he gets into a stressful situation and gets up. He beat me, and my mother does not know how to deal with us, and unfortunately I do not know how to defend myself, and he hits me, bringing out all the anguish and resentment in his heart. Unfortunately, these words are not in front of my father, and since a month ago, my brother has been tired, and I have been taking care of this, and when he is very tired, he is upset and goes to hit me. I have been getting better throughout the month, and his beatings have increased greatly. When my father found out, he said, “I am the one who made a mistake and want to create problems out of nowhere.” When I show him all the beatings and bruises. he tells me, “You are definitely not annoying him.” But by God, I have not done anything to him. In the past two weeks, the beatings have been a lot and severe. As for psychologically and physically, I have perished and I have accumulated some money. Should I rent a small room to live in alone? And  work, but I don't cut  relationship with my mother. and I really need your help. I hope someone comes across what happened to me and tells me a solution, and I will be very thankful. I'm sorry that I took so long with you"
"(P.S. this is long I’m sorry!!!)

So I am a 16 year old male, well I’m trans. Female to male. Only a few people in my family know this information due to my family being either heavily conservative and that means they come with being homophobic. Basically I live with my grandma due to my mom leaving when I was pretty young and my dad passing when I was around 8. I am the youngest out of three.

Ever since then, my grandma has normally been nice. She got mean when my older brother neared 15 and he started to act out. She clearly took her anger out on him and hit him, yelled etc.
Well he moved out when he turned 18, no hesitation. She skipped over my older sister and went straight to me- she says it’s because I’m like my mother and no one likes my mother.

Lately it’s been getting worst, normally she would yell insults at me but now she’s hitting, throwing things and leaving bruises just for the smallest things. 

Yes I’ve been on contact with CPS, multiple times but they do little to no help. They constantly just saying she is grieving since my dad is her son. And I’m not disregarding her grief, it’s real, I know trust I know.

Some more back story, a lot has happened to me from starting around 5 years, my mom being a raging alcoholic and drug addict and kidnapping me and my siblings on multiple occasions, seeing my dad bash a man’s head into a wall until he was just blood and brains, my dad getting cps called on him by my mom, being sa’d by my brother when i was 6-8, and so much in my teenage years to now. I go to therapy but it seems like it doesn’t really help, I have diagnosed severe depression, severe anxiety and severe PTSD. My grandma knows this, she just doesn’t care at all, she doesn’t believe in that stuff.

With her doing more physically abusive lately, it’s really been declining my mental state and that plus working long shifts isn’t helping, she also doesn’t allow me to take my antidepressants anymore. My therapist is also not available this whole month. I’m not sure how to deal with it anymore."
"So my parents especially my mom suck ass as parents so so much.
My English is not my native language but I'll try my best to explain 
So my parents are both pretty abusive people they've both abused me and my brothers both physically and emotionally.
They've went through my things , they've thrown all my childhood drawings some bc they were LGBTQ.
Nice my mom Almost strangled me ,thank God I had a scarf.
She pulled my hair just bc I forgot to do something she insulted me.
My dad in the other hand is also a natural douchebag he beated me and my brothers when we were little as""teaching "" juet because we didn't understand the subject .they've once locked me in a dark room as a form of""punishment"".I once hated them but now I don't but that doesn't mean I love the heck no.
I'm planning to leave when I'll be 18 
They are the only people that I think that deserve to be respected 
I've tried to tell them that beating is not an ""education"" but they called me an hypocrite.
My mom blames us for nothing and uses it to take our things as a form of ""punishment"" just because weve made her mad.this woman has the audacity to ask us why don't want to spend time with them like are you kidding me.i'm tired living with these two. My father once said just because I told them that choosing a school for my brother and not letting him making his choice ,but that douchebag of my father started a whole stupid argument about him being older and that he knew more that us that we are stupid blah blah blah.im so sick to even stay next to my parents, I'll definitely cut them off for  good 😊 
The court called social workers on my name I sincerely don't know how it happened but I couldn't say anything to the social workers bc my mom was next to me....I can't take all this shit anymore  "
"before i start i just wanted to apologize if anything i say doesnt make sense. i have a very hard time wording things properly, especially when im talking about something sensitive :') so pls bare with me. 

  
growing up i never really had a good relationship with my father. after i turned 8 (19f) i think is when our relationship started getting bad. he used to yell at me just to come into the living room so he could yell at me (again) about my weight, which to be fair i was a bigger kid but our family's diet didnt help that one bit. my father liked having meat (red meat), potatoes, and a slice of bread every night after work and he hated it when my mom and i would eat something else. he'd go on about how theres no point in us even eating as a family anymore if we dont eat the same meal. oh and if supper wasnt ready when he got home (he got home at around 4-5pm, he owns a roofing company so he controls his hours) he would pout about it for hours on end and accuse my mom of trying to starve him all day because he refused to eat during the day despite being diabetic. 

another thing that was an issue with my weight was my insulin resistance which i didnt even know i had until recently. anyways because of my insulin resistance my neck used to be really dark and my dad thought that was because i wasnt washing myself properly so he would make my mom scrub my neck everyday for months until my neck was bleeding and it would be a scab the next day. no one thought that they shouldve brought me to a doctor even once. 

he also found it entertaining to torment my mom and i 24/7. we spent most of our summers traveling on the road and camping with family, and his favourite thing to do was either grab me or my mom and yell really really loud to scare us while he was driving, and me and my mom both have severe anxiety so you can imagine how it affected us. 

my father was also just really weird towards me. i remember this one morning i was getting ready for my schools picture day (i was in grade 2 or something like that so this was still very exciting and fun for me) so i spent all morning picking out my outfit and curling my hair with my mom (we put sparkly hairspray in my hair and i loved it) and the first thing my dad did was look me up and down, whistle, and called me sexy. this happened 2 maybe 3 more times. he even called one of my younger cousins from another province sexy. she was like 2 or 3 maybe.

we had a lot of horses when i was younger and my father had a close friend who was a farrier (he put horse shoes on horses and trimmed their hooves and stuff) and everyone had this running 'joke' (i dont think it was actually a joke but this is what everyone said it was so i say it was) where i was dating the farrier (i'll call him R in this post ig) and there were so many times where he would grab me and sit me on his lap and sometimes my parents would leave me in the barn alone with him and he would try kiss me and touch me. my mom never said anything about what was happening and my dad always laughed it off and called me R's girlfriend himself.

i also had a niece who's older than me by 2 or 3 years and when i was 6 she would get me to sneak out to our old farm trucks to smoke cigarette butts, and when we were home alone (my sister would bring her to my dads so we could play together) she would turn on a porn channel on the tv and make me watch with her. there were hundreds of times where we got caught but no one ever said or done anything, it was always a quick ""oh! you shouldnt be watching that."" and someone would switch the channel and move on. though we did get caught smoking and we got into DEEP shit for that (one of my sisters smelt cigarette smoke in the basement one morning and told my dad). 

im sorry if this is a huge mess with grammar and spelling mistakes. i have only shared this with my therapist and i have tried to talk to my mom a few times so i can maybe get some closure on some stuff but everytime i have she either plays it off, calls me over dramatic, or invalidates me. i wanted to try lift the weight off my shoulders at least a little more than i have with my therapist. because of the things i had to put up with my mental health has had a tight grip on my life but i think im finally starting to slowly heal :) "
"14F, my moms hit and intimidated me since i was younger, never taught me boundries, never taught me what was right or wrong. just yelled at me for doing wrong. they didnt treat my cat right. and neither did i (he died when i was 10 from some sort of poisioning?  since he went outside alot and i didnt rlly know that was wrong either.)  i feel guilt for the way i treated my cat even though i didnt wanna hurt him. i looked after kittens before and im scared i somehow abused them without realising. my friend dropped one kitten bc it scratched her. obviously i got mad but it was an accident. we tried to comfort the cat but the black kitten didnt really like being touched (this was a year ago?) i used to always pick them up and stuff. they meowed alot but idk if that means they hated it or not..i never hurt them or anything. i just wish i stopped bothering them. i dont trust myself at all and constantly blame myself even though id never abuse a cat or hurt anything. or try traumatise one. i love animals.

i feel horrible that i couldnt do anything abt how they treated my childhood cat. i was so clingy and so aggressive (not to hurt but i was never told it was bad so i used to pull him, playfight with him (not aggressively js gently) scare and chase him, spray him , put stuff on his head , like in those vids where some sort of teabox or smth is on the cats head. i was around 7. i never kicked or hit him (from what i remember. i still dont trust myself though.)  i used to tell my family to stop whenever they shouted at him or was mean to him but i couldnt do much about it. and my cat always used to scratch me really hard but i js thought it was ""Playing"" not signs of uncomfiness or scared.  i even remember searching up ""im scared i abused my cat"" when i was like 9 years old. because i blamed myself for everything. ive had anxiety like that sicne i was little  so thats all  i passed it off as. i just thought "" i love him and id never hurt him so im just being stupid!"" even a few days ago my friend brang up ""we just use to drop ur cat off ur stairs. (like a few steps up)"" and i said ""yes but we didnt throw him and we weere young"" i just panicked because i didnt know if it was wrong. and now my brains telling me i was excusing my behaviour.

thats just one part.

my mom scares me and hits and hurts me. she acts like a normal loving mom alot of the time but shes literally tackled , threatened , hit, chased, thrown things, screamed, intimidated, locked me outside.  never really monitered my internet or behaviours, didnt find it a ""big deal"" when i was SA/D by my ex friend and used it to just send hate to her family bc she didnt like them.  constantly had police over when my mom and sister fought and i cried bc i thought i was gonna be taken away. my mom used to say things like ""ill smash ur head into a wall"" from even when i was REAL YOUNG.,during our family holiday in 2022? she was physically fighting my aunt and other family with a literal bed leg?  they both were. she came up to me (i was crying) and said ""im going to kill her."" (referencing to my aunt) . the next family holiday (this year) was fine up till the last day. they screamed and my mom threw something at my nan. i snapped and shouted back. i usually do this anyways.

my mom saw me making sexual stuff on a game when i was 10 and all she did was scream and tell my sister to monitor everything i did. even tho she couldnt give a shit about me anyway.

this behaviour has passed onto me. im not excusing what i did, people ive upset have a right to be mad obviously.. but i cry everytime i realise i snapped at a friend, or my bf. without realising. and i upset them. its become so bad that ive noticed i lie abt almost everything, even trauma. just to feel valid. ive put myself in situations where i hoped something traumatic would happen because for some reason i wanted that attention? ive split constantly on my bf, become attached to him. hes taking a break now and honestly he might not even come back. i try to please people who hurt me because i hate being hated. i hate being misunderstood.

ive said and done so many horrible things to the point i feel i dont deserve life. or love. i have the urge to leave everyone

im not including a big chunk of whats happened to me bc alot of it isnt relevant to the sub

i should hate u mom. i should hate u family.  but i dont. i love them and have fun and make jokes with them. im a piece of shit overall. i dont know how i even have people around me."
"I'm not close to my dad. Not one bit. I don't know his passions, what he lives to do, what his life goals are, his type in women, nothing at all. He's distanced himself from us about the time me and my sister hit puberty, and I've made another post before on this sub where I mentioned he makes us cover up at home, please read that for more context.

I want to stalk my dad on Facebook using a fake account. Not just looking at his posts and stuff, I want to actively engage with what he posts, in a way that could make him reply to my interactions and I could get a look into his life, his values, his morals. From what I've seen from our miniscule interactions, he doesn't seem to respect women much.

The thing is I don't know how I should go about this. Should I make a catfish woman account? Should I make a troll fake account to see what triggers him? Should I make a preaching account to somehow change him (even though I know I probably can't)? I want to do SOMETHING that could make me know truly the kind of person he is. Please give recommendations, advise, suggestions, etc etc. Thank you.


Also, there's a problem with this. I'm afraid he finds out that account is me. I know that sometimes FB accounts tend to sync to phone numbers. So how do I avoid having him find out that I'm from his contacts and potentially find out its me? I could actually be physically harmed...



(Optional read) before I get comments like ""why don't you talk to him directly"" I physically cannot. Long ass story which i can explain in private. I just feel so much anxiety when I talk to him. I can't. It's too mentally draining for me."

"I posted here more than two weeks ago about my abusive mother. She's over it, but I'm not. And I can't stop thinking about it after what she's done today.

  
Me and my mother are both doll collectors. Well, I was. She likes to collect expensive and rare vintage dolls that will probably get Thanos snapped if any of her three children touch them. I like to collect any dolls that I feel a connection with, and she for some reason thinks they're for my sisters as well. I'm not surprised, her and father think my room is a playroom. She gave me some of her dolls as a present. Most of them weren't really expensive or rare, except for like two. But I loved them.

  
Last fight she took 14 of them away. And they were laying in her room, in a bag like trash. She took all dolls she deemed pretty and all dolls she could find (some were in different parts of my room). They spent two weeks away. In these two weeks I've realized I'm done. I don't need her shit anymore. Today she casually brought this bag in, saying ""oh I put some of them into my collection, here, take the rest"". Half of them were missing. And coincidentally, they were either cheap, hand-made or POC (my mother is racist). I told her I don't want them but she put them into my room anyway.

  
I feel so hurt. She never apologized. She took what's mine, she hurt me and doesn't care. My heart aches so bad and my hands are shaking. Am I overreacting?"
"I’m writing this as I’m coming to the realization that I will be leaving my two younger brothers with my father who is verbally and physically abusive towards us. Since I was born my dad has been verbally and physically abusive. He would get mad when things did not go his way or when he did not like how events played out. I did not know this behavior was not normal until one day when I was younger and he had hit me and told me to cover up the next day before school so that no teachers took me away. He would only hit me when I did “bad” things as a child, misbehaved, or got bad grades in school. He wanted me to be this perfect child. The same went towards my sister who is two years younger than me. He always tells me “when I die you will be grateful and remember how I raised you” but that’s far from the truth. He did not hit my mother but he did verbally abuse her and my grandparents for years. He would call me all sorts of names and degrade me as he punished me for my “bad” behavior that I now know is things kids do at times like spill water on the floor or being scared of the dark.

I am currently 20 and I’m about to move out to be closer to my college campus. My sister who is just about to start college is going to be dorming at her new college. This leaves my two younger brothers age 13 and 8 to stay living with him. Although my dad is not longer as abusive as he once was and as strict, it is still pretty bad. I can’t stand the thought of leaving my little brothers to endure that type of physical and mental abuse. They are both the kind and shy. My youngest brother who is 8 has adhd and anxiety diagnosed by a doctor already which my dad does not believe. He says the doctors are wrong since “such things do not exist”. I can already see how scared my brothers are of him and I’m worried they will suffer the way me and my sister did when we were younger. I see how my dad screams, yells, berates, and even hits them but I’m too scared to say or do anything for fear of what he might say or do to me. He has threatened to hit me or kick me out. Since my brothers are financially dependent on my dad and mom I don’t know what to do. I want to step in and stop him from yelling or hitting them but I’m scared. I’m 20 years old but i still get scared of what he will do to me. I can’t even hate him properly since he is still my dad. 

I just need advice on what to do.

"I’m not sure where it all began but the earliest I can remember is when I was being groomed, it was from the ages of 9-12, I’m 17 now. She found out about it and called the cops on the guy. Now sure that seems like a decent parenting move until after she made the call. She came into my room, dragged me by my hair and told me that “The only person you should be calling Daddy is your father and that I’d never know what a penis would feel like. Who would say that to their kid, let alone a 12 year old?

 Sure I was a dickhead kid and tried sneaking on my devices after she took them all away but it was only to contact my school friends. She noticed the tablet was gone and came into my room so I pretended to be asleep. She saw it as I was trying to get back in contact with the guy that groomed me so her best idea was to tell me to “wake the fuck up” and when I wouldn’t move she started beating me. Of course she took the tablet away from me but what is beating me senseless gonna do. It didn’t stop there either.

 The summer after I caught myself trying to run away because of an argument we had over my room being a complete mess. She had kept bickering with me over it and I wasn’t having it so I told her to leave me alone and she went batshit. She took one of my mason jars filled with beads and smashed it at my feet. Of course I stepped in it while closing my door and I decided I was going to leave through the fire escape. I ran all the way to my friends house and she tracked me there and had the police called. My whole family showed up and she took my phone away.

 We’ve gotten into many petty arguments since and I have been trying to avoid her until tonight. My sister follows in my mothers footsteps and is like her little pet. She snitches and me and all types of other shit. She got me in trouble over a charger which caused my mom to go on a rant about how I am disrespectful and spoiled and the least I could do is help out with my sister. Which I do indeed do, more than I should have to. If she goes to work at 8am and wakes up at 7am, my sister is awake at the time so why not feed her before you leave. She takes 15 minutes to get ready.

 Every time I try talking to her she ends up venting about herself and I hate it. She tells me that I can talk to her yet makes it about herself all the time. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety yet whenever I try explaining to her that I can get myself out of it on my own she gets mad and starts taking away the things I like doing as if they’re a distraction. With the way she acts I’m scared of even moving out when I turn 18 in fear of what she’ll do to my stuff or me to make it so that I can’t.

Yes, I do realize that she cannot legally do that but it’s hard for me to get the courage for it. I’ve told many people and I have gone to the police about it a few times but they have always taken her word for it over mine because she’s an adult. I know for a fact that all my nearby relatives that could take me in while I’m not with her are on her side and they see me as disrespectful and lazy because of the things she tells them about me. 

She has made threatening remarks in the past month about “blacking out” on me or punching me in my face. Or even going as far as saying she’d drag me down the stairs by my hair. She’s made many comments regarding my body and how we need to get in shape though she had to get surgery to lose hers and doesn’t even go through with it. She will go days without buying groceries and claims that she’s depressed and stressed about work and compares it to my diagnosis at every opportunity she gets.

 I don’t know what to do as far as taking action to get out and I’ve been seeking help for the longest. Reddit is my only option at this point, I barely use this app to begin with lol."
"My mom often puts me down by stating things like ""I'm irresponsible"" or that ""I don't care about anything"" and it honestly makes me really mad and upset.... if I fiercely tell her to stop because it hurts my feelings, she'll think I'm just talking back and being disrespectful. How do I very nicely tell her to keep quiet and not say things like that, because they make me feel like maybe I AM irresponsible, and that's not good for my self-esteem? In a way where she actually listens and stops."
"My mom was abusive and a drug addict. She abused and starved me, locked me in a room, and pretty much lowered me down to nothing but a maid. My siblings grew up calling me “slave” until I was 13 years old. 
I left my moms to go live with my dad who wasn’t in my life before. I was 17. Everything was going so well until I found out he’s a domestic abuser. He beat my stepmom and really hurt her when my child was 2 months old. Everyone forgave him (I was iffy) and he seemed to really be working on himself and bettering his mental health. I was so willing to give him another chance and have a relationship with my daughter (never leaving him alone with her though, ever). He did it again recently. 
Cutting him off hurts me, but I’ve already cut off my own mother so it’s something that I’m used to. However, what hurts the most is knowing my baby is going to grow up not knowing either of her biological grandparents. I’m so thankful that my stepmom took on the role of grandma and loves her, but I know one day she’s going to ask questions about my parents and that’s going to be a hard conversation. I know it’s the best thing for her, but it shouldn’t have been this way in the first place. She was just getting to the age where she knew “grandpa” and had gotten so attached to him, and it really breaks my heart for her. Idk, this shit is just so hard. "
 After so long of being a fucking control freak this is the first time he was ever in my level to talk to me. He's always dismissed my autism saying it's something I'll grow out of. He said finally that it's ok that I have problems. It's ok. I still have issues but honestly this is the most happy tears I've cried in my life. I just hope I can have this forever 
"I was very sensory seeking when I was little, and sometimes when I was in the bathtub; I would get on my arms like I was doing a push up, and then start rocking back and forth, because I liked the way the bumpy texture on the bottom of the shower felt on my skin, and I figured out at some point, that my penis was more sensitive than most of my other parts, so I would sometimes rock back and forth against the floor for the sensory input. It wasn’t sexual because I had no concept of that as a small child, but sometimes my body would react to the stimulation. 

My earliest memory is my of older cousin, who I I later confirmed was 12 at the time, coming in to check on me in the bathtub for some reason, and her catching me doing this when I would have been 4, and her yelling at me when she realized what I was doing. Her yelling scared me, so I got out of the bath and ran crying to my mother, but when I tried to hug her, she saw that I was naked, and that I had an erection from the physical stimuli of the aforementioned sensory seeking behavior. I remember her face turning bright red with anger, as she pushed me away to grab me by my arm with a death grip, and then she spanked me with her other hand until it felt like my whole back was on fire. I remember my cousin crying and begging her to stop, and my mother yelling at her to get out. Once she was finally done spanking me,  she made me stand up and then forced me go stand in the corner with my nose against the wall, still naked, sobbing and covered with my own snot, shaking like crazy from fear and pain. I remember her making me stand there until I was so tired, I physically fell over. Then she spanked me again until I was screaming, and I either passed out or blocked out the rest, because I don’t remember her stopping. The next thing I remember, I was laying face down on her bed, and she sat next to me and put a frozen bag of something on my butt and legs. I remember that she told me that I had been a very bad boy, and that because she loved me so much, she had to punish me to make sure I learned my lesson and didn’t go to hell.

I still to this day, as a now 25 year old man, have an incredibly hard time engaging in any form of sexual intimacy. 

After working with a therapist, I decided to bring up this memory to my mother. When I confronted her, she looked at me like I was crazy, and accused me of making it up, and called me sick, she told it was a perverted fantasy that came only from my brain, and told me to seek help.

I then brought it up a few weeks later with my older cousin.  She confirmed that she remembered it happening, and cried because she felt like she caused it. She was also a child, I never blamed her. 

I have talked to my therapist about it at length, and part of me wants to confront my mother again, with my cousin to back me up. The other part of me knows that it doesn’t matter how much proof I have, she isn’t going to admit it. "
"my mom has been verbally abusive since I was about 7, I'm 15 now and had to grow up way too fast. 

ill start from the beginning, when I was under 10 she would do stuff like yell at me constantly and point out how I was ""fat"" (I was just a slightly chubby kid) and she would always remind me of how she would cry herself to sleep because of me. I never did anything mean to her, I was little and didn't know how to control my emotions so I would often yell back and it would be an argument.

anyways, when I was 8 my mom started doing this thing where she would tell me that she would pack her bags and leave back to Europe by the next morning. that is terrifying to hear at that age because my mom is my primary caregiver, I only see my dad 3 weekends out of the 4 that are in a month. she would tell me that she was abandoning me after any little thing I did, I dropped a mug when putting away dishes and it chipped a little bit and she told me she was gonna leave. 

my mom has also been an alcoholic her whole life, she drank during the pregnancy of her first child (miscarriage) and drank during her pregnancy with me. she is scary when she's drunk, she is 100x more verbally abusive and I sometimes have visions of her hitting me. I don't think she would ever hit me, but I'm not sure. 

she also used to force me to sleep with her. she made me sleep with her until I was like 11 or 12, then she would get mad and start screaming at me and saying how I hate her just because I wanted to sleep in my own bed.

my mom would also always want to see me naked. anytime I would shower from the ages of 9-14 (puberty) she would tell me to get naked infront of her so she could ""inspect if I showered properly"" which would result in her checking everywhere, even my private parts. she still asks me at my age of 15 if she can come help me shower, when I tell her no she always pulls the ""why do you hate me so much?"" card.

the christmas of 2022, I was 13. our tradition is to put up the christmas tree in the morning and then open gifts that night after supper. anyways, after we put the tree up I went and sat down at the kitchen table and picked up my phone to just relax a little bit, my mom walked by and she went on a rant about how I'm always on my phone and then she said something I'll never forget. 

she told me this: ""you are not the daughter I wanted, I wish I never had you"". anytime I bring this up she tells me I'm lying and that she never said it, when I literally have the date written down in my notes of when she said it. 

I know this is long so I'll just list off the other things she does:

she still spanks me in a ""joking"" way, in public, after me asking her and telling her countless times to stop.

she punishes me by not buying me groceries, like if I don't get a chore done before she gets home she'll go ""then I guess you don't get any groceries then"".

I am in the beginning of the process of getting a lawyer and taking my mom to court so I can live with my dad, I'd like some advice and some tips on how to deal with this.

thank you for listening to me."
"I hate my dad and I don't even know where to start on the reasons why. I hate him I hate him I hate him. He is the number one reason to every negative feeling I have and it seems like he can't stand me being happy so he has to ruin it. I financially depend on him because I'm 18 and the minimum wage of my country isn't enough to rent a flat, plus I'm being paid less than minimum wage because no one else wanted to hire an unexperienced transgender teenager so I'm stuck on small gigs that can barely afford my lunch. 

I don't think I can stand being alive in the same world as him. One of us has to die, and if he is not dying, then I will. I will keep trying to kill myself until his death. I'm tired of being alive and wasting my days because he keeps hurting me and the police doesn't do anything because he doesn't hurt physically. Yea sure sure he never beat me, but he insulted me of every word possible, tried to disappear with objects to make me think I'm going crazy, says things and then when I cry about it he says that He didn't said anything and that I'm making things up because I'm an attention seeker. He forces me to do things and then call me ungrateful for not enjoying them. The list goes on and on forever. I will keep trying to die until I either succefully finish it, or until he dies by himself."
"My dad has complete control of the WHOLE family. My family consists of like 7 adults excluding my dad, yet we're powerless against him. We totally rely on him and can't even do anything about his rare anger fits, because he's our only breadwinner. I'm scared of him, my sister is, everyone is.

We're immigrants who still don't have citizenship of the country we're living in, so if we report him, he'll lose his job, and we'll probably go homeless. I don't even want to report him or have him fined or anything like that, I just want psychological power over him. I hate awkwardly giggling when he's speaking, or feeling inferior around him, or feeling like a people pleaser seeking his approval all the damn time. It makes me feel so pathetic and it's humiliating.

He's done so much for us, I can't deny that. But he's emotionally basically non existent. He doesn't care that I don't have friends, he doesn't let me and my sister go out even though we're legal adults in a sage country. Our classmates always go out with their friends and we miss out on so much. All my teenage life passed by just me addicted to my phone because I'm so lonely and alone. I hate being around him, it's so uncomfortably anxiety-causing and I get so on edge and tense.

I don't want to cower before him. I don't want to be afraid. I can't afford therapy. I don't have a job (he doesn't let) I basically can't do anything. He's cheated on my mom and been physically violent with her many times. And I always find myself forgiving him and end up forgetting about how horrible his actions were. He always gossips about people and says extremely inappropriate""jokes"" that leaves the whole family having to fake laughs. It's exhausting.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give advise on how I can be powerful OVER him, and maybe even intimidate him??? Should I tap into my femininity because I heard men are intimidated by this most?? I don't want to cause fights or anything, I just want to detach myself from his control. Any YouTube videos?? Any books?? Any articles, stories, PDFs??? Please!!! I want to be psychologically from this pathetic people pleasing personality."
"I (28F) have a somewhat distant relationship with my parents. I'm trans, live in another city and am polyamorous (which they don't yet know) and undiagnosed but probably autistic (which is its own can of worms). I was recently lectured by my father (49M) about why he's suddenly stopped accepting me as trans again. I came out seven years ago and he initially came around to it, and my mum (47F) remains supportive, just worries about my physical safety.

One of the arguments he tried to make really irked me. He said I now need to detransition *because* he is finding it hard to accept. That when I get into a relationship, it needs to be with a cis woman because that was the idea he's had for me since I was born. My mum wants me to move back to their town because she's struggling with the distance. They said I need to live life for others, and that means that sometimes I need to sacrifice my own happiness. If I do not do these things, this will be seen as a selfish act on my part.

My father has also threatened me with the idea that I'm causing them to want to split up, and that my mum might kill herself if that happens, as she's around menopause age and thus I ""need to be careful with her"". I can thankfully see this for what it is - emotional blackmail. I used to struggle with self-harm and suicidal ideation myself, and I wouldn't even dream of using my mental health as leverage in an argument. Surely my parents' relationship with each other is their responsibility, not mine?

I'm a sensible person. I understand when sacrifices actually *need* to happen. I plan things out and make sure I have a safety net. I am completely independent and stable financially and haven't so much as gone to my parents for advice in about a decade. But the sacrifices they're asking for are *the* things that are making me happy in life. I'd love to be closer to these people, but I feel more hurt every time we meet. I genuinely can't even confidently say I love them any more, I'm just terrified of the fallout they threaten me with.

It's making me miserable honestly. It's been this way for years. *Is* this abuse? How can I communicate to them that I'm my own person and that I can't just throw away my relationships just to make it easier for them to deal with?

TL;DR - Parents want me to make enormous changes to my life because they find it hard to deal with, framing my decisions as selfishness. I want to know whether this is considered abusive and to communicate that I can no longer tolerate this."
"TW: sh, violence, suicide attempt

VERY long vent ahead! 

I've been staying with my mom for the past 3 weeks bc my father got mad when he saw my report card and saw I had Ds bc I literally missed a semester of school due to a suicide attempt because of him! And he threatened to kill me so my mom had to pick me up (thank god she was already there visiting) he gets mad over anything lower than an A, he gets mad about the music I listen to(bc I don't like pop music), I don't dress in all pink like he wants, the fact that I'm bi. He tells me that I have no friends bc I'm a freak who can't be normal if my life depended on it.  My mom has to take me back Sunday bc he'll call the cops and my mom will go to jail (he has custody) I've told counselors and therapists that he's abusive and they tell me I'm a fucking liar. My mom can't afford a judge so that's out. I just don't know what to do. I have PTSD nightmares from him every other night because of him. I really don't wanna go back. I've started cutting to ease the panic attacks and that's the only thing I can do to make it stop. If I make even a tiny mistake, I start shaking and apologising even if it wasn't my fault. I'm not motivated to do anything I used to love bc of him, I stay up all night bc I have nightmares at night and sleep all day and my mom's kinda mad about that. I don't know what to do

I'm crying while typing so I'm not checking for errors, sorry

"Disclaimer I have depression and anxiety that stems from my father’s constant emotional abuse as a child. This is all from my point of view and I really hope it’s not misunderstood I’m not delusional.
So my dad and I have never had the best relationship ever since my parents divorce. He comes from a lot of generational trauma and sometimes that would carry over onto my sisters and I. I always tried to impress him and tried to be the perfect child. I was the like his counsellor as a child his emotional punching bag in a way of words. He’d often tell me that he was more harsh on me since I reminded him of my mom. Eventually as I grew up I couldn’t stand it and slipped deeper into my depression. I ran away from him in a sense I guess sorry don’t want to go into the details. I went to go live with my mom and it was great to be honest. But eventually my mom slipped back into her substance abuse. I retreated back to my dads since I mentally was doing a lot worse. It was fine we fought quite a lot and didn’t get along. But eventually I tried to just keep my opinions to myself. 
 Now back to the main issue. I fought with my dad again he’s always talking about my weight and usually I can ignore it. But I couldn’t this time and snapped. I said a lot of horrible words like swearing off and telling him to go away. But he began to follow me and yell. He had that crazy look in his eye that I’ve always been scared of. And we kept arguing and he started to say that he’ll smash my head into the ground if I don’t stop talking. Saying he picked me up and he can take me out. I was obviously upset and to be honest I wouldn’t put it past him if he did do the things he was threatening me with. Since he has a history of abusing women in the past and with the one off occasion with my step mom. He finally left me and I started crying on the porch. My step brother saw me and I asked for a hug and explained he threatened to hurt me. I later told my sister and she just said she didn’t know what to say. I spent the next couple of days avoiding him because I was scared. I started to plan on how to move out but I’ve never lived somewhere without my parents so I’m terrified. I thought eventually he’d come apologize like he usually does since I thought he went to far but he never did. Until tonight 2 days after the fight. He told me I was mentally deranged and that me going around the house complaining about him was wrong. That everyone thought I was strange and mentally unwell. That what I was doing was wrong.
Am I going insane am I the one in the wrong. 
I’m so scared that he’s right and that my sister hates me. 
I don’t know what to do
If anyone has any advice or can put their two cents in I’d greatly appreciate it.
I can’t go to my sister anymore since I have reason to believe she is fed up with me. 
Thank you for reading. "
"Hi. My (f17) boyfriend (M17) is allowing me to make this post in search of advice on what to do/legal advice because his parents are forcing him to play soccer.

My boyfriend has been playing soccer since he was about 3 or 4 and has been in both club and school teams for his entire life. He used to enjoy the sport, but even in the beginning, his father would berate him, force him to practice for 2+ hours in the morning and then 2+ hours at night. His father had also physically and verbally abused him when my boyfriend was 2 or 3 and the physical abuse stopped a little before the age of 8. All of the subsequent emotional and verbal abuse since then has been to call my boyfriend a failure, an underachiever, a loser, etc, even though he is one of the top players on his club team. But, even if he were one of the worst, it’s still no excuse. 

In the past year, my boyfriend has suffered two major injuries, an almost completely torn through ligament in his leg, and a torn shoulder ligament, both of which required massive surgeries with the longest healing time lasting 9 months and weeks upon weeks of physical therapy. Despite this factor, and a major depressive episode lasting months, my boyfriends father forces him to practice soccer for 2 hours in the morning most days and sometimes still 2 more hours at night, despite some residual pain in his knee and shoulder. This is taking a large mental health toll on my boyfriend and he is visiting with a psychiatrist at least once a week for therapy appointments. 

Recently, he has expressed to his parents that he wishes to quit soccer and desires to do things he actually likes. My boyfriend has expressed to me that he believes he may have actually liked soccer if his father hadn’t completely sucked the joy out of the sport. Despite this request to quit soccer, his parents are continually forcing him to go to soccer college camps and compete in them. This is making him depressed and anxious. They complied for maybe a week before just yesterday, manipulating him into saying yes. His mother said he was selfish and a failure, and that he is throwing away his natural talent. They continue to taunt him and use me as a reason he is “weak minded” and a failure, which is not true as a i would support him whether he wanted to play soccer or not. Oh, and I forgot to mention, they complied until the very night before he would have to leave for a two day long camp that is three states away. He officially left about 3 or 4 hours ago. Because of my boyfriend’s mental health he has gotten resources from a mental health hospital, but has never had to have had a visit there (no shame if he did anyways). But, his mother has coerced him  into going to the soccer camp by threatening that she would send him to inpatient for five days. my boyfriend did not threaten self harm or suicide or anything that he would have to be sent away for, she simply threatened it unprovoked because he didn’t want to play soccer. 

He is constantly being taunted by his father about soccer, and his mother, who is not innocent, is complacent in everything and is allowing him to be abused in this manner. she has told him from when he was little to hide the bruises his father gave him and has never really offered him a true feeling of safety with her. Even though she never laid a hand on him, I believe her actions are deplorable and her and his father need to be held accountable.

The thing is though, CPS already knows about the abuse he endured as a child, but is there something he can do about the threatening to send him to a mental hospital if he doesn’t play soccer, and would that be through CPS if need be? 

I feel like this situation is very specific and I’m trying to google how to do this, but I feel like it might be good to find help from people who have maybe gone through something similar. I also believe the forcing him to do a physical sport is a form of physical abuse and has to be acknowledged. This has been going on for as long as he can remember and I’ve been dealing with this with him since three years ago when we started dating. I’d also like to state that the verbal and emotional abuse doesn’t just start and end with soccer, but applies to every other corner of his life. What can I do to help him and what can he do to help himself? Legal OR General advice appreciated

I want to be get adted little helping hand 
"Hi so im new on this app and I installed it since i knew theres a lot of people who may be in my situation. My mom is abusive, she is beating me daily for no reason and thinks i own her everything, she also tells me daily how i should kym and she wishes she never had me, even if i got used to it i still get hurt by her words. She loves to make fun of me, calling me names, i have bpd and she makes so many jokes abt it by calling me crazy and how she wish i would get killed some day. Sometimes when she sees me happy she makes fun of my smile, or find a reason to punish me. Im tired of living this way, im poor, i have no one to talk to abt this or to help me, my mom even lie to everyone that she loves me and we have a very close bonding just so she can keep a good reputation. I don’t know what to do, i can’t call any kind of child service since in my country abusing ur kid is normal and nobody really cares. I need help, im 16 and i’ve been thinking about running away but im sure i wont make it or i wont be safe by myself. (ik sorry for my bad english, english is not my first language)
"
"My mom has always been good to me, she never hurt me, but she’s always been a little strange. As a kid, I had the normal weird humor of any kid, and my mom would joke like that, etc. but now I’m genuinely bothered by what happened. 

So I’m at my aunts new apartment to shower because my hot water heater broke and we are looking for someone to install the new one, and I’m sitting down in a chair playing on my phone, and then my mom just walked over, and sat on my lap. Now something to know is that I’ve dealt with sexual assault in the past, so I’m very uncomfortable with some physical touch, and stuff like that, and she even told me she’d stop her normal “jokes” (playfully “spanking” me ever so often) but hasn’t. Anyways I told her “Dude, it’s way too hot for this.” And she just laughed, I almost slipped and said “Dude it’s way to fucking hot get off.” But I didn’t, anyways she wouldn’t get up until I finally said fuck it and just shoved her off. I don’t know if it’s just normal teasing or not, but it’s been bothering the hell out of me. Plus (just me being paranoid I’m sure) anytime I date a girl, my mom will ALWAYS find something to judge them by. “Oh she seems like she’s trying to hurt you” and “oh you haven’t even met her how do you know she isn’t bad” etc. she always finds the slightest detail and tries to pry us apart.

Another thing is she often touches me somewhat inappropriately. (Excuse my language but it otherwise sounds childish) she will randomly slap or pinch my ass, and I’ve told her to cut the shit, she said she would, she doesn’t. I have had to slap the back of her hand away because she would keep doing it, and it’s not bothering me. A lot. "
"there is no physical abuse but my mother is being a real control freak, threatening my sis (10F) with religion (everything she does is based on religion, corrupting my sisters view on reality and life), other kinds of psychological abuse (for example, she just shouted at my sister “shes useless” because she didnt want to read a religious book, this happens all the time) always shouting and she has literally turned my sister into a monster too, they always scream at each other, always because mom tries to control everything about my sis. she is the reason my sister is behind with everything compared to her peers, socially and academically. she still acts like a 6 year old. (because she is being treated like a 6 year old) she doesnt even want to let my sister go to school (not because she wants to homeschool her, because she doesnt think it should happen, she would rather raised my sis closed up in the house, become a saint or whatever) its like those cult movies you see. 

she (sis) never gets acknowledged, respected, listened to. and even when she does she is bombarded with “god, god, afterlife, sins, devil, god” im scared she will grow to be obsessive, paranoid, anxious and ostracized by others. she is already showing signs, scared that god will punish her with every wrong thing she does, shes anxious and paranoid. she always has stomach aches, never eats, shes so thin and weak. also bullied at school, she can never fit in, and this is moms fault. (i know what its like not to fit in, but in this case its mostly my moms fault to turn my sis into this person she is, its like a mini version of her) the bad part about this is she still is by moms side, mom has brainwashed her. she slowly starts to rebel by not wanting to read the books but shes still by moms side a lot, thats all shes known her entire life. 


i really want to get her out of this, but theres nothing i can do. (im 18F and we live the 3 of us) dads kind of out of the picture, i mean not really but mom and dad are already separated, almost for this exact reason. dad cant be an option to take us in, i wouldnt want that either. all my moms side of the family could do is maybe talk to her but they would probably support my mom, even if they didnt theres nothing they can do. but theyre still all better thsn her. 

idk thats it ig i just want her to grow to be a healthy individual"
my mom keeps touching me inappropriately and when i confront her about it she just laughs and tells me to not take it personally. i dont know what to do i feel like sh\*t and i feel like its all my fault or idk but she taught me to always take the blame and suck it up even when i was not at fault. now everything i do i cant go without feeling bad because i made another mistake i dont even know anymore my life is fu\*\*ed
"my mom and sister work at the same company so shes controlling abt what time she wakes up and goes home bcus she basically drives her and her own sister (who also works at the same company) to work. my sister wasnt waking up on time so she kept yelling abt it and when it was 15 past the time she said “wake up i need to go to work and earn a living! if u dont want to then dont drag me down with you! i need to earn a living bcus i have responsibilities not like you BOTH who sleep all day and dont do anything and just think of yourself! selfish!” even tho she told me before that i dont have to look for a job so soon. i left my job in January due to my own stuff, and basically due to burn out and probably mental illness ive been asleep almost 80% of the time. recently ive got back into gyming but damn ykno. my moms sister is also a bitch bcus she always excuses my mom’s behaviour by saying shes the way she is bcus of my father. well hes dead now, so what now yknow? also just bcus my dad is financially irresponsible doesnt mean she can just be a bitch to us and lash out at us all the time. my mom also excuses HERSELF by saying that “well im just mad i just say things and dont mean it” but takes every rejection from me or my sister very very personal. it sucks living with her and i hate her. it feels so alone when i think about it bcus for so long in my life my sister never really took my side when i would talk about her abuse. and even now i feel bad for calling it abuse bcus i feel like it isnt so bad but everytime she reminds me why i feel this way and why i cant say anything to her abt anything. god im so sorry i just feel so tired"
I know it's kinda selfish but I've gone through this crap for 5 years and I'm so sick of it she's angered easily but a few minutes later will be totally fine she gets upset at simple mistakes I understand she has a lot of pressure on her shoulders but her outburst get more and more disturbing leading to outcomes worthy of a call or two to CPS she acts like a child getting upset when things aren't the way she thinks they should be I hate how she pushes this narrative that family should always come first which is good logic but not in this case) I lost love for her a long time ago so much so that I'm unable to feel actual affection towards her she's very racist (but she doesn't see it that way) and VERY homophobic again she doesn't think that but when my brother came out as gay she started talking crap she also pushes everyone away then says everyone is fake and put to get her I can't wait til I can move out  and dump her into a retirement home and let her rot for the rest of her days
"So trigger warning talks about physical abuse. 

I grew up in a brown household, and am the first/only daughter. My mother was emotionally blackmailed into marrying my father, by her parents, and I've known this since I was a child. They had me a year into their marriage, and I've always known that she never really wanted to marry him.

Now, I understand what happened to her was wrong, except she's chill with her family, and has physically and mentally abused, me and my siblings all of our lives.

My father has also been physically abusive occasionally and gaslights manipulates us. But I know that he truly loves me and would do anything for me. Except I can't trust men. My maternal grandfather, passed away before my mother's wedding but he was the one who had initially started with the blackmailing, because ""he had given her everything she wanted her entire life, and in return she should listen to him."" She doesn't think he was in the wrong, and that he was caring. I hate him because I could never imagine taking my child's rights to decide for themselves. Everyone around me constantly praises him and I hate it.

I've never been able to truly trust my father because of this and have grown into a very defensive person. I don't like people taking control of my life, so growing up I would constantly try to draw a boundary. 

Growing up I never saw a healthy loving relationship between my parents. In fact I was the one who had mediate their fights. I would standup for my mother, whereas her only family members would make fun of how they forced her. But in the end they were the ones she loves. It infuriates me, because I consider them traitors. I can't be nice to them because im always reminded of their shitty behavior, especialy since they still make insensitive jokes, and never take blame. Even though they do send me gifts and try to be affectionate, I can't show affection to them. 

Now I'm at a point where I've started financially earning but I can't move out because I have to pay for my university, and it's against our culture( I live in an Asian country), and tbh I'm not making enough. 

I'm trying to change and get rid of the toxic traits that I have in me. 
I'm very loud because I've always had to scream just to be heard. And I wanna get rid of this. And I curse a lot but I've realised it's because my mother used to curse a lot. 

And Ive never been in any romantic relationships, not even close. Because I've completely closed myself off. I'm very emotional when it comes to my friends but I'm scared that I can't open up like that or my partner will use it against me. 

It's like even if I get out of this house, the effects will always stay there. Everytime I start a new relationship, what my parents did to me will stop it from evolving into anything good. 

It took a long time for me to emotionally open up to friends but even now I get scared that I'm a nuisance to them. 

And my parents keep gaslighting me and telling me that they've never abused me. It took me ages to get rid of the shame. I felt as though I was in the wrong and that it was embarrassing to have parents who abuse me. 

It's so scary because they say that they did it with good intentions but they can't see that it ruined me. I feel so broken and I don't know. I just need to know that there's hope, and that someone out there has survived and learnt and actually become a new person. "
"hey, this will be my first and probably only post on reddit. i just needed somewhere to get it out of my mind and off my chest. both of my parents suck and i don't have somewhere else to go. 

my biological father is a monster. he's diagnosed with schizophrenia and dependent personality disorder. he's not a monster because of these diagnoses. he's had many wrongs in his lifetime and a lot of trauma. i did not know about the schizophrenia diagnosis until just this week - when his ex gf reached out to me to discuss. (she was worried and wanted to let me know if i had 't been aware and offer resources with the journey.) 

his mother, my grandmother, is a hoarder. her house can't be lived in and has been unsafe since i visited for the summer in the 2010s. she and my father are horrifically codependent. the doctors had to tell her that my father is a grown man and can take carw of himself at the hospital. 

she's outright a narcissist. i recall multiple instances where she's going off on my disabled brother for not doing everything to her standards and i jump in to defend him.

i had to write a handwritten apology because this 70 fucking year old woman got so asshurt that a 16 year old told her to back the fuck off that she stopped showing up to bring food for a MONTH. she verbally berates everyone. i've had to apologize in public when she goes off on racist rants and, in one specific instance, i had to call insurance when she keyed another family's car when i was 12. 

i've cut all contact with her. she's the first person i've ever had to do that with. she ran the house like it was the military. 

my father is comparatively nicer. he has moments where it feels lucid, like he's an actual person with feelings but that's only 30% of the time. i have vivid memories of chatting with him happily before doing homework and then getting verbally berated only minutes later because i wasn't following his directions to an exact. 

my earliest childhood memory of him was an argument about table manners (my brother did not like to bring the fork to his face, instead he leaned down to eat.) and it into him hitting my 14 y/o brother and shoving him into the closet door. i was too young to process it happening to the degree i know it now, just that it felt deeply wrong to witness and something about it was innately backwards. 

i got diagnosed with adhd when i was very young, in first grade actually. and when my mother told him about the medication i would need to be on, he pulled over and walked out of the car yelling that he would never have a kid ""with (r slur here) issues"". he's always spoken to me like i'm deficient. it's always felt like i had to do something to earn praise from him. 

currently i am in my 20s and out of a job. i planned to be in college at this point in my life, but i can't afford it because the early savings account that we as a family set up, got drained for his goddamn mother to fill her house with more useless clothes. 

the parents i live with (my mother and stepfather) yell at me constantly about getting a job but i keep failing interviews and i don't have enough experience in the field i want to work in, because of aforementioned college fund disappearing 'magically'. they charge me ridiculous rent that by now has ""been piling up."" despite my mother previously promising that she would never do that. they will not listen to me when i try to explain that it feels like i'm just now trying to do the whole growing process again. 

my stepfather has been trying to step in as a father figure. which i appreciate, i think. families are going to be difficult, even in healthy non-abusive ones. but he's oscillating between threatening to kick me out if i don't get a job in the next few months and saying it's out of love. i don't know how to feel about it without outright having a panic attack. i think i'm just far too gone to have a proper parental figure suddenly try to introduce themselves and be a part of my life. 

my mother is bordering alcoholism, i think. it's a hereditary thing in the family and my grandfather on her side started this pattern similarly. a month ago i had to stay up until 2am to make sure she got home safe after repeated nights out of drinking and getting high with her friends. 

she's easily impressionable, and fell into a bunch of racist conspiracies and homophobia during the 2020 lockdown. she's a bisexual woman, i am a nonbinary lesbian. i don't understand how it happened. she makes me feel lost. it beats the hell that my biological father has raised though, don't get me wrong. 

- heres the catch, i have further job opportunities in the city my biological father lives in, but i can't live with him under any circumstances. he's had psychotic episodes as recently as 2022 despite his treatment for it. 

i just feel defeated and hollow. it gets better, i know it does. i just never knew just how bad everything i didn't know prior to this… discovery was. i loved my father and wanted to move in before knowing this. 

im at the point where my brothers and my dog and the potential of things suddenly turning around is the only thing keeping me going. if i didn't have my dog i don't know what i would do. 

i would like to forgive my parents as long as everything changes but i currently have no faith in it. i just don't know what it's like having a loving family. 

thank you dad, you ruined my fucking life before it even got a chance to start. thank you mom, for repeatedly acknowledging issues but not solving them. "
"I promise I’m not an angry person. I try my best to be accommodating and understanding of those around me even if it’s at my own expense and discomfort. However…

Lately I’ve been washed by a title wave of anger triggered by my parents (they are divorced). My dad has a history of abusing my mother and older brother, but “calmed down” after him and my mother split when I was quite young (I am now 19), but he’s always been unstable and as of late he’s assaulted me along with CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT HIS OWN IN PUBLIC and genuinely deluding himself that he has done no wrong. It’s safe to say I haven’t been seeing him since incidents. 

And then there’s my mum. She’s more like a full time bully than a mother and it used to make me so fucking depressed and it still does, but as I get older it also makes me so angry I get scared. Every sentence that comes out of her mouth is negative in some way or another. She talks in a constant shouting/screaming voice when she’s at home and interrupts me mid sentence so often that I’ve mostly given up even trying to talk to her. She constantly says she hates me, that I’m such a burden and that I make her miserable. She insists that she takes control over anything important in my life regarding my independence. For YEARS I’ve tried to communicate with her that the way she speaks to me causes me so much anxiety and anger and anguish, but instead of being receptive she blames ME for her problems and threatens to make my life miserable for trying to make the household a healthier one. 

I also have type 1 diabetes which is managed with diet and medication. Without these two things I can die 😃 and both my parents give me shit about it constantly and berate me when they have to pay for my medication, go to my hospital appointments, or when my sugars aren’t ideal. They will never know the constant anxiety I go through regarding my condition and how physically and mentally draining it is to inject myself multiple times a day, have to be pedantic about what I eat, treat low glucose episodes, ect…For them to rub it in my face and tell me I don’t know how to care for myself probably makes me more angry than anything.

I also have a younger special needs brother that needs a lot of support that is also being affected by our parents and I can see he is also slowly getting more and more angry and anxious with what’s going on in our family and my heart truely fucking breaks for him.

If you read all of this then thank you. I’ve had a really shit day and normally I’d never post something like this but I don’t want to burden anyone in my personal life with my shit. I’m not looking for answers. I just needed to vent."
"Hi everyone, before I get started on anything let me first establish that I’m still a teenager living with my parents. 

I’m having difficulty living with my mom’s rules on what I eat and I don’t really know what to do about it anymore. 
Ever since my mom has downloaded TikTok she’s been altering my family’s lifestyle.

 I have nothing against this, if my parents see something wrong and want to change it by all means. 

But her rules on eating are quite strange, it starts off quite tame like; Don’t eat too much oily food, don’t eat too much salt, etc etc. But she’s so hellbent on not eating ‘sweets’ and by sweets it’s anything with sugar in it like fruits. 

And obviously anything on this list is because she’s taking precautions so no one in my family ends up with health conditions (diabetes). Which is fair, but it’s gotten way too far to the point I can’t eat anything with an overwhelming sense of guilt coming over me. I can’t even eat something in front of her without her lashing out on me about how I’ll get diabetes and it’ll be my fault. 

I’ve been skipping meals to avoid the conflict of my mom and her dietary choices. The only times I’d eat would be early morning and before bed when everyone else is in their rooms, but I can’t help but feel so guilty when I fry an egg and think to myself that I’m gonna get very sick from eating the oil. 

Cooking is one of my hobbies that I’m very fond of, but I’ve started to let go on cooking since I can’t help but think is this what my mom wants. It just felt like I was cooking for her and not for myself. 

I’ve tried talking to her about this in the past but it always jumps to I know what’s good for you and ascends into chaos. I don’t feel comfortable talking to her about this anymore. 

Any thoughts on what I could do?
"
I 25 fm just got disciplined like I was 10 my dad got upset because my brother was talking with a slightly raised voice and came out into our living room and started lashing out on us he hit me in the face and scolded me and I fell and then threatened to punch my brother?? No one said or did anything to antagonize him he just got extremely irate and yesterday he threw his office chair across his office and almost broke it in half and the night before that he snapped his controller in half out of pure rage I’m absolutely terrified of him and how aggressive he is I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him and it’s genuinely sad he never got caught treating his whole family like this for as long as he’s had us 
"I (19 F) am home for the summer from my freshman year of college. My parents are not very good at maintaining my privacy, and especially like to come into my room unannounced or without asking. For the past serveral years, my father almost only ever talks to me when it is to tell me to clean the house, do schoolwork, or something church related (they are active mormons, I don't believe but have to pretend I do to keep them happy). Today is my mom's birthday. Several times this summer, my father will tell my mother that (me) and him will do the dishes and clean up after dinner because she worked so hard on cooking. It really bugs me when he volunteers me to do work. I don't mind cleaning up, but I really value my automomy and he rarely ever actually helps too. He did so today, and I admittedly made a face when he said he and I would clean up after dinner. He proceeded to get really offended, and get really upset that I wasn't willing to ""even do this one thing on my mother's birthday"". I've tried talking to him before about how I feel his love is conditional to how much work I do for him, and he laughed. He said I didn't mean it and I knew he loved me. But he only talks to me to tell me to work, and it's been going on for years. The problem really isn't the cleaning. It's that every time I bring up how he talks to me solely about things I need to do for him, he gets mad and defensive. He often also starts listing all the ways he financially supports me, which makes me feel guilty. I always end up apologizing, feeling like I'm in the wrong and entitled, and wishing I had just kept my head down and done the work without comment. Am I entitled, is he just bad at parenting, or is this emotionally abusive??? I really can't tell if I'm in the wrong for being so hurt about this. "
"i live at home with my ""dad"" if you can really even call him that. he has depression and probably other issues, constantly everyday i dread for the time he is back from work as there is always something he will find to start a huge argument over, again if you can call someone shouting at you and telling you that you are useless an argument as i never like to argue cause it will make it worse. i am constantly being threatened to be left out on the street with all my belongings. i dont do anything to deserve this. he was never there for me or my sister when we were kids and it took him getting into a car craqsh and someones child dying to get him to realise he wanted to see his kids. i barely knew him until i was 13. i clean up after myself and him often, i pay 500 pound per month to him for my shitty room in his council house, i recently checked the bills and i pay more than him to live here. that bare in mind he only got a 2 bed flat from council because of me living with him HIS SON. so we BOTH had a ""home"". instead its constant reminders that i am just living here and its all his because it in his name. i have had to fend for myself money wise since the day i turned 18 he said ""youre an adult now you need to provide for yourself"". he wont even share a pice of toilet roll with me and will hide them from me. he often favorites my sister and treats her really nice and takes her out and spends time with her but never would do that with me. they sit there and eat steaks and live all happily and im always treated like an outsider. i have been struggling ever since and just putting up with the situation as i thought it may get better but it hasnt and i am now 25 and have been putting up with his neglect and emotional abuse and gaslighting since i was 13 and had to move in with him cause my mum couldnt cope with me as a child. i have been trying my hardest to work and earn enough to move away from this and can never seem to get any further, whenever i do well he will notice and put the rent up. i cant afford to move away and get my own space. i feel my childhood and teenage years were taken from me due to all the stress he has caused me. there is loads i have missed out and im sure no one will understand the extent of emotional abuse because i have memory issues and struggle to articulate things properly so i dont know how to write it all in a way that shows my situation. i must have been hitler in my past life to get such a dad. i dont know what to do and i see no hope anymore,. all my friends have heard him how he is and all agree that its not right. i often see them with their dads and how their parents care for them and it breaks my heart that for whatever reason i dont get that from my dad. i haave nowhere i cqn go my mum lives with her husband in a 1 bed flat i dont have any mates with spare rooms. i cant find a girlfriend to live with. is there any organisations or charities that will help or am i just unlucky and have to live and hate existing. will i ever get my hope back for a happy life???"
"My parents don’t think I’m capable of raising my children on my own. I’m deaf and have chronic illnesses, yes, but I also have a supportive partner. We’re engaged. My partner is capable of supporting us and is fine with renting a place where my kids can live under our roof. He has taken my kids out to do stuff when I can’t, like ice skating, driving them around, etc. However my parents are forcing me to stay here in their house. The irony of the situation is that my ex is trying, for the same reasons, to force the kids to move back in with him, and they don’t want to. I have told the kids repeatedly that I will respect their wishes in this matter. If they preferred to be at their dad’s I would support their decision; if they prefer to stay with my parents I’m fine with that too (although we would still rent a place with space for them, so they could come and go as they pleased.) But my parents are saying that 1. I’m not a good parent 2. I’m not capable of parenting on my own (although I wouldn’t BE on my own! When I am feeling unwell my partner would step up, and if they were under my roof I would of course push myself to play an active role.) I am very depressed living here. I hole up in my bedroom, which is the same thing my middle child does at her dad’s, for the same reason. It’s not that I don’t get along with my parents, it’s that they constantly treat me like a child and then complain when I act like one. For the record, I have tried very hard to be more of an adult around them, but living under their roof causes me to fall back into toxic behavior patterns. My body reacts to the stress, so I’m in pain a lot. And my mental health is suffering. I was trying to endure it because I thought that when the school year began, my partner and I would live together in a place of our own. So while I was never *happy,* exactly, I was trying to maintain a facade of normality. Now they are telling me that I must only *visit* my partner but remain here. They keep saying that it’s for the sake of the kids, but I am not doing well here and once they said that I immediately lost all motivation to even attempt to be stable. I’m severely depressed and having trouble taking care of myself. I know things would not be like this with my partner because we’ve had long periods of co-habitation and I was much more functional, despite various health issues that have cropped up recently. I was motivated to get out of bed and take care of myself. Now that is gone. I don’t understand how they can possibly think this is good for the children? I will never be physically well 100%, but when you add severe depression into the mix, the result is very bad. How can I get them to understand that I want to be free? I don’t think I will live to be old, and I want at least a few years of living apart from them. They don’t seem to understand that this is driving a wedge between us, and that when the kids have graduated I intend to move to Alaska full time and go low-contact as a result of this. It feels like a prison. A nice one, yes, but there’s a poisonous lack of freedom that is causing me to suffer."
"I am a 15 F and I have no longer the joy to live
I have abusive parents and I don't know if I should endure it till I become 18 or run away.

To give you and example when I was 5 two boys almost the same age took my toy and mocked me, like any kid I went complain to my dad and he said ""grow up I haven't time for this"" in an anoyed way. I insisted cuz it was my fav toy and he got mad and yeeted me back to the sandbox hurting my back.

When I was 7 I received a fake bird that could fly. I asked my parents if when can we go outside so I can play with it, they said later and i agreed. I waited and days later I asked again, my mom snapped with anger for an unknown reason and said ""break that shit it's getting on my nerve!"" My dad, her slave as always, did it and I was holding my tears up so that my sis doesn't see me crying (she was 4.)

But the worst was at 10.
We were in Morocco to visit family and me and my cousin 13 where alone with my uncle and he brought us to a strip club? And the owner looked at us with a disturbing grin and he and my uncle talked. He payed my uncle and my uncle said to us go to the room 3 and wait I will get drink.
Spoiler alert drinks never came but other things yes.
A guy came in and he started looking at my cousin (forgot to tell my uncle had told us to only wear shorts and tight shirts). He started to approach my cousin and touched her in inappropriate ways. my blood was boiling cuz she was the only one nice to me. When he tossed her shorts off while her screaming to not and trying to fight back something snapped in me. I remembered my multi gadget had a knife and before I know it he had three holes in the chest and my knife was dirty with this man blood. I was panicking but hopefully my cousin made us leave by the emergency exit. That wasn't even the last straw, my uncle is a pedo and he tried to grop us countless times but every fucking time I complained my parents says. ""You are probably miss interpreted him  that how he show love!""or ""he's family and it's your fault cover up"". He even kiss me in the lips multiple times now what doi say to my futer kids? ""oh yeah my first kiss was taken by my uncle!"".
I feel like throwing up remembering this and knowing i have no power against it.

Today my parents made us change country again without telling us so no goodbyes to my friends or having a last hang out. No. For the 3th time.

It's been a year since I am in this country but they want to change again and that would mess up my studies cuz not all countries have the same education system and diploma.
They even make all the chores on me:
Cleaning 
Cooking even the lunchboxes for my parents (not that it bothers me but they only call me names not even thanks or a smile)
Babysitting my siblings in summer so almost no time to go out except after 5 pm and for a good reason.
Therapist and even if i A.L.W.A.Y.S. Talk calmy and nicely they find a reason to snap
Have to be perfect (grades,personalities,have a good knowledge and etc so they can flex)
Bank (they take my allowance or money from my part-time job)

My siblings literally come to me first cuz I am the responsible.
To the point that I don't even see my siblings as siblings but as my kids.

They always argue honestly I hoped they never Married. They always call me names never my name to the point that if you call me by my name I will get weird out.

The only thing stopping me from running away are my siblings.

But should I? Or wait till I became 18 or end it all ?

basically what the top says. 
"Father is quite abusive, growing up in an Indian household, I'm always scared of him, giving up everything I liked through my life, he forces me to read management and misbehaved with my friends and my cousins, he always yells at me and makes me feel uncomfortable claiming I should beg and not study, he stopped me from going to another country and I'm 20, depressed, frustrated, emotionless and made my mind, seeing so many toxic and abusive husbands, fathers, mothers and families, i will be friendless, single and childfree for the rest of my life. 


I'll be there at my dad's Birthday and other functions but I'm going no contact later onwards and I'll be away from everyone, I need some help in how i can be a bit better at avoiding abuse. "
"I am 15f and have immigrant parents who are 42f and 42m, throughout my childhood my mom has been a constant source of hate and anger but I am writing this post because I genuinely do not know if this counts as abuse especially since we are brown and so a lot of this behavior is common in brown households. So I'm gonna give a little insight on some things my mom has done to me while I was under the age of 10 although I don't remember around 85-90% of the things shes done to me while she somehow remebrs every bad thing I've done. So in elementary she took acedmics very seriously and every single day she would make me do extra practice work that would take hours to do and would be above my grade level. Many many times while doing above grade level ixl with her if I got a question wrong she would take the iPad I was doing it on and hit me repatidly with it on my head, also she would scream and scream till I was crying if I made any mistakes. One time when I was around 7 so in first grade I got a question wrong and she took a pencil and stabbed my arm with it which made my arm start bleeding. Also several times if I did something wrong she would grab me by my hair and would drag me across the floor just by my hair which was incredibly painful and scary. Also when I was around 2nd grade she would take a cooking tool similar to a wooden rolling pin and would hit me with it which hurts like hell because its huge and wooden. Throught my childhood if I did anything wrong she would hit me and I would actually be happy if she used her shoes to hit me because they didn't hurt as much. Also a few times she got so angry that she grabbed onto my arms and clawed at me to the point where my arms were bleeding. Theese are just a few creative methods shes used to hit my but often she would just slap me, despite all this what she did to me phycally wasn't nearly as bad as mentally. So ever since I was a little kid my mom can not speak to me or treat me like a normal human being let alone her daughter, whenever I ask her a simple question she snaps at me and never speaks in a normal tone. This obviously makes me reluctant to talk to her and when I still do our conversations always end in agrumnets. She is extremely easy to upset and when she does get angry she spends hours whispering to her self while cooking or upstairs about all the horrible things she wishes would happen to me or my family. I can not recall everything she says and she speaks in our native language so its difficult to translate but she usually says something along the lines of how much she wishes we were dead, all the truly disgusting and sinister ways she would kill us for emapmple my stomping my head in or kicking and rolling me around and spitting on me or murdering me or kicking me out of the house to live with street dogs. All the examples I've just given are extremely tame versions of what she says, her whisperings are very graphic and detailed and they make my stomach turn I don't understand how someone can whish such disgusting horrific things on their own children when most people wouldn't wish it on there worst enemy. Her whispering that she does is still pretty loud so everyone can hear her and its basically her trying to curse us or wish for the worst most gruesome violent things to happen to us. She does this several times a day and does this for very very small things. Theres a lot more insane things shes done this is the tip of the ice berg. "
"So, my mom and her boyfriend have been together for about 10 years now and for all ten years they've argued with each other, usually it's just an argument about something stupid and nine times out of ten my mom's boyfriend is the one to start the argument. My mom is a very calm and peaceful person who hates confrontation, so she usually tries to walk away from the argument but that only pisses off her boyfriend, sometimes to the point where he hits her or puts his hands around her neck. Now my mom wants to move on and he refuses to leave. Literally just ten minutes before typing this we nearly had to call the police on him because he kept grabbing her by the arms and not letting her leave the situation and he also put his hands around her neck again. My mom isn't the only one he has put his hands on though, he has tried to choke me and he has hit my brother. I don't hate the guy but he needs mental help, for whatever reason he doesn't see any of this as wrong. There have been nice times with him but for the most part I've been stressed out over these past ten years. I'm 25 and I don't have the money to move out, all I  want is some sense of peace for a bit, I've spent a large chunk of my childhood stressed out and scared."
My mother invited my stepdad back in for the third time. He’s threatened to kill me. My fiancé. My little brother. And my older brother. He’s put his hands on my mom. Stolen her car. And I don’t have the money to leave because my mom wants 600 a month from me and I wash cars. I’ve tried desperately to get another job to no avail. My stepdad now wants to step in and threaten to kick us out and she says it won’t happen yet when he says something she sits back and lets him. If I don’t find someplace I might actually break.
"So the police found out about my dad and the thing is it isnt that bad, but the court case cost around 5k and we don't have that money. I wanna go surfing but I had to sell my surfboard to give my dad the money to go. Even though he is an abuser he still is my dad and I'm scared. He blames me for everything."
"So I do want to get too into it because the story with my mother is decades long but curious about an outside perspective on my relationship with her. 

Currently my mother is homeless/on the verge of homeless. It's been like this for the past 3 years. She's made no effort in the past 15+ years to get a long term stable job and unfortunately has just squandered away and money she comes across to afford any kind of living situation. However with no job this money goes by quick. We seem to be on an every 6months cycle where she texts me asking for more money because she is again about to be homeless (this has happened at least 10+ times in the past 3 years). 

She claims her various illnesses are what is preventing her from finding a job. Yet she doesn't take care of herself and is letting these health issues be an excuse for why everything in her life is going wrong and not her fault. 

Yesterday I get news that our families dog who unfortunately has been with her in these tumultuous times needed to be put down (she was 7 years old black lab). She got sick out of the blue and I believe this to be a lack of care from my mother to our dog. I just finished college hence why I have not been taking care of the family dog. I also suggested that although painful to give up this animal it would be best for her to have a family that could properly take care of her. 

Regardless because of a lack of funds on her end, I just paid 800$ for all the blood work the did on the dog and her euthenization. Im glad our dog is not in pain anymore but extremely distraught that this situation even had to happen.

She is again after this just happening yesterday asking me for 300$ to pay for her hotel shes been staying at. I just can't keep throwing money at her knowing it will never come back. I am currently supporting myself and my younger brother as well. 

I always feel guilty for saying no to her but after years of this and an unstable childhood  I just can't do it anymore. I guess curious if anyone has dealt with a parent like this and what they did to cope? 

TLDR: My mother has been homeless for 3 years, constantly asks me for money to avoid eviction. She blames health issues for not working but neglects her own care. Recently had to put down our dog due to her negligence, costing me $800. Now she wants $300 for a hotel. I'm supporting myself and my brother and can't keep funding her irresponsibility. Wondering how others cope with similar situations.

this is gonna need some background information, so i'm sorry the post is so long.


my (20F) boyfriend (22M) and his sister (24F) grew up in a dysfunctional family, in which they were fed and given shelter but neglected in terms of: 
- emotional neglect (exposed to parents arguments and personal issues, no family time, ignoring mental health)
- educational neglect (allowed him to drop out of school, made no efforts to encourage study)
- environmental neglect (unsanitary surroundings and food handling, holes in floors and walls not being fixed, not being fed a balanced or healthy diet)
- not having a hygienic environment 
- not taught or encouraged to get a job or higher education, how to write a resume, essentially most basic skills parents would teach their teens/young adults 
- losing/not giving him his important documents like birth certificate that he needed in order to get a provisional license, passport, etc

as well as neglect, his father is frequently in and out of a job due to him not showing up and so they have him and his sister give them money to buy large amounts of cigarettes (they struggle financially already, and his sister is also in debt due to this). 
My boyfriend is also diagnosed with ASD, which impacts his ability to get hired (discrimination, sensory and social issues).

As a result of all this he and his sister are reliant on staying with their parents and are not yet able to move out. 
this has created a very depressing, solitary environment for my boyfriend as often nobody is awake in the daytime, they do not interact unless to ask for money or dump their emotional load onto him, and he is held back from pursuing a happy and fulfilled adult life. 

Onto what the title says, their mother (F60) is diagnosed with schizophrenia, which can largely influence her behaviour. 
She regularly refuses to take her medication, and as a result will act aggressively, say harmful things, make unwise financial decisions, and they don't know what they can actually do as she is an adult, and when they have had to dial 999 did not receive adequate help.

as their father refuses to step up, my boyfriend and his sister take the brunt of this and have to regularly walk on eggshells and act as her caretakers. 

my boyfriend is afraid of leaving home for too long as she has expressed suicidal intent before, made threats, and he feels personally responsible for her. 

he isn't sure if he can contact social services or if anything exists that would help him to develop skills and find work/become self-sustaining as an autistic adult, which 
drives him to feeling hopeless and at times suicidal.

I wanted to ask the *adult adults* of reddit, what can he and his sister actually do in this situation to become independent? are there resources available in the UK for this niche situation? 

it pains me seeing him so hopeless, he is an incredibly intelligent, selfless, and capable person who deserves to begin his own life and thrive.


tl;dr:
my boyfriend and his sister were neglected and abused growing up, and are struggling to move out for a multitude of reasons (boyfriend struggles with autism, sister in debt because of parents, feeling responsible for mother's mental health and providing for their parents). as adults, what services or support is available to help my boyfriend and his sister become independent and break free from this toxic household?

"i 19f am living at home with my parents 51m and 43f. when i was younger they were extremely physically and mentally abusive. my dad once threw me into a windowsill and knocked me out for being too loud while my friend was over. my mom called me a slut and said i looked terrible when my friend did my makeup. they say i did not experience a difficult childhood even though we were dirt poor and i’ve been abused my whole life. now, for the most part, the physical abuse has stopped beyond certain occasions, but now they are set to ruin my life. i want to go to college to become a vet, but they are keeping me trapped here. i got into SIU carbondale, paid for housing, registered for classes, put in my notice at work, everything. all i asked them to do was fill out the FAFSA so i could get a loan. this caused them to take my car to the junkyard, refuse to sign anything, and scream at me for hours. i have done everything i can. i tried to get a private loan but was denied because i don’t have a cosigner (i will never find one) i cannot get federal aid without them signing a FAFSA refusal letter, and i have no way to pay out of pocket. i told them i will commit suicide if they don’t do this for me and they laughed in my face. they do not care about me, they just want to leech off of me forever. i’m out of options. they have beat me. i am seriously considering suicide now, because if i can’t build a future for myself, what’s the point? i said this to my dad, and he agreed i should do it. i cant run away i have nowhere to go, ive tried everything to get a loan, its impossible. if you have any advice, please, let me know, i could use anything.

TW: I talk about suicide and self harm.

PS: I don’t think my parents are abusive, but I thought it somewhat fit the subject.

Something I just realized is that I think my parents have really messed me up. To the point that I don’t know what to expect from people anymore. I don’t know how to expect being treated and I feel like I can’t expect that people are there for me, because everyone I have ever talked to about the stuff my parents did to me have just said that humans can’t be/aren’t perfect.

I was struggling with intrusive thoughts about killing my little sister (I have severe OCD).  I had struggled every day, every single second for a year. I stopped liking what I used to like, like dancing and I struggled to the point where I couldn’t even take care of myself and do basic stuff like shower. I walked upstairs to my mom while crying, then I asked her to talk to me and come downstairs, which I only agreed to after my dad persuaded me to talk to her. We got downstairs and she looked at me with a cold face as I sat there crying and sobbing from being terrified and exhausted, and she told me “why don’t you just do it then?”

When I finally tried to kill myself my dad told me that she had said that she felt nothing (my dad didn’t mean it as a bad thing, he thought it was because she was just tired, so he said it to me because he thought it’d show that she really did love me).

On the night that I killed myself my mom and dad left me alone at the hospital. I was laying there, alone, devastated and sobbing in the dark for the entire night. The one time that night when I tried to call my parents, they both got mad because they wanted to sleep and then they hung up.

I once asked my mom if she loved me. Because I wasn’t sure if she did anymore, she said “yes.” but based off of her emotionless tone, that was a lie. She also didn’t say anything more. Just that simple word. Yes.. I know my mom. When she did love me, when I was younger, she would’ve gotten sad that I believed she didn’t, but now, all I was met with was an emotionless voice saying the word yes mechanically.

When I had tried to kill myself a second time, by cutting, I eventually gave up and called my dad as I had to get to the doctor to possibly get stitched up, and after I had explained the situation to him all he did was complain that he had to drive me to the doctor and so I had to take the bus (which is okay, I’m just sad that he didn’t care at all).

When my mom later saw that I had cut myself, she didn’t react at all. She was still as happy and just kept talking like it didn’t matter at all.

One time my dad and I talked and he said that if I ever died he doesn’t know if he’d cry (he has this thing where he doesn’t think he’s generally able to cry though).

The things my parents have done to me, and the fact that they weren’t there for me when I needed them the most, has created an emotional wound in me that I will have to carry for the rest of my life.

I look back at the pictures of me and my parents from when I was a kid. And even though they are alive, it feels like I have lost them. Like they are gone.

My mom and my dad, who I felt safe with. Who said that they’d always love me and that nothing I could do would ever change that. They aren’t here anymore.

And if it could even get any worse, I now also don’t know what to expect from people. When I was only 16 and needed my parents, the two people who were supposed to protect me. When I was so mentally unwell and so devastated, exhausted, sad and in need of support and help. They weren’t there. Instead, they started doing and saying some of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me.

And everyone I’ve ever told about these things always tells me “well your parents probably does love you” and that humans are not perfect.

I just read somewhere about a girl who had had a really bad day as she struggled with her mental health. She had talked to her boyfriend about thoughts she was having about self harm and that she was really struggling. Later that day when they went to bed he asked to have sex with her. She wasn’t in the mood at all, but said yes. While they were having sex she suddenly started bleeding from her nose. He told her that he could just “throw a towel over it and then she could finish off”. She said that she wasn’t in the mood anymore and started crying as she had had a really bad day and were struggling. And she was sitting there explaining to him that she wasn’t in the mood much in the first place, but as she’s talking to him he stops her mid sentence and tells her that she put him in a weird position here because he needed to jack off to be able to sleep. Then he pulled up his phone to watch porn and jack off next to his crying, bleeding girlfriend. To all of this I thought: “well, I feel bad for her, that was not an ideal reaction from him, but humans aren’t perfect.”. That was my reaction. It wasn’t until after I started reading what others had to say about it that I started realizing how bad he was really treating her and that it wasn’t okay.

Now I am genuinely concerned about myself. On top of the fact that I have lost my parents and that my mom doesn’t love me anymore, all of this also seems to have affected me in the way that I don’t know what is normal and what is not. I don’t know what to expect from people, or how I should expect that they treat me. How can I know when someone is going too far and treating me badly? How can I know what is okay and what is not? 

Even when I read about what I’ve written here and about the things my parents have said and done. I don’t know if I am overreacting and that maybe I am expecting too much from them. I don’t know. All of it feels really hurtful and some part of me thinks it maybe isn’t okay, but the other part of me remembers that humans aren’t perfect after all, just like everyone has told me. All I know is that I clearly have issues with knowing what is okay and what is not, and I need to learn myself what is normal behavior from people and what I can expect from them so that I don’t get abused or end up in bad situations. Where should I start and what do I do? 

If anyone has any advice then I’d love to hear. Thank you so much for reading.

"Hi it’s two in the morning when I’m writing this. I am so scared for my life right now I won’t lie. I had written in a previous post that my parents do not have the best relationship. My dad is very angry and violent and my family is scared of him. My parents are almost always arguing and it literally has broken my family to pieces. 

I don’t have much time to type it all out but I encouraged my mother to get a divorce while my dad and brother out of the house telling her how I don’t like the way he treats her, how he oogles other women, and how suicidal I used to be when I was young because of him (there was more but im rushing). She cried and promised she’d do something. She said she wouldn’t tell him.

She lied.

She just told him what I said at two in the morning and he’s losing his shit and they’re arguing. The cycle repeats. 

I don’t know how to live like this. 

It’s been like this for practically eighteen years and I’ll never be used to this."
"My step dad has almost a hatred for me and I don’t know why. He treats me and my brothers so differently it makes me feel like an outcast. He will not talk to me unless it’s to give me shit for something, yet he will have full conversations with both my brothers. But recently I have been talking to someone and we are getting into a relationship and he all of a sudden is nice to me only when my boyfriend comes around. It straight up feels like he’s trying to make a good impression with my boyfriend only, but he’s hurt me so much I don’t want anything to do with him. I have told my boyfriend some of the things he has done and he knows that I don’t have a relationship with him at all. It makes me upset that he can only have a conversation with me when my boyfriend is here yet when he’s gone he flips sides and becomes the person that shit talks me the most 😭😭😭"
"like one minute they scream and shout and fight. i've been dragged across a room by my hair before, slapped- punched, hurt sexually, once when i was little i had to take my little sister outside in nothing but my pjs and her in her underwear, leading to me taking my top off to give to her while it was winter out there because my mum was screaming and crying that we ate dinner because our dad told us too but our mum wanted us to wait. my mum has told me she wished the cancer i had as a kid killed me- that i was an accident, and that she blames me for the affair they are having.

but then the next they spend some of their money on me and seem to care and are nice to me and tell me they love me, and support me and i seem to think im overreacting. 

it goes 1. my parents hate me and make me hate myself 2. i internalise the hate and self sabotage 3. it makes them hate me more 4. i pull away 5. they are nice to me, and it makes me doubt myself 6. repeat forever

i feel like such a loser and a burden or an idiot and an asshole at all times. is this a well known cycle? idk what to call it."
"So hello everyone I am a girl residing in India and in my teens. I will keep it short and simple
I have been beaten up by my parents since a young age over trivial matter. But recently it has become more. My dad has begun to thrash me rashly so does my mom. Recently my dad became so angry when I asked a break from my studies that he came to my room , made sure he closed all windows and doors and then took me to the dining room and thrashed the hell out of me with a cloth hanger also punched and kicked me in front of my mom and she too told nothing. My thighs were all black blue with bruises and bruised stayed for more than three days. 
He is also continuously threatening to choke and kill me because it is waste for spending money on my education. 
Verbal abuse is also to the max level
Please tell me whta i should do Or should I keep quiet"

"I am 5'3, 19yo female weighing 115 pounds at most. I eat fast and I never go for seconds. I moved out of my abusive household and into my grandparents home and they are wonderful. The only thing that bothers me is grandpa keeps saying things like ""we eat four meals with you here, it's like me, grandma, you, and you"" or ""I know you're definitely hungry"" when ever food is mentioned. ""I'm sure you can finish off what ever left."" They really don't like left overs but are making way to much for three people to eat.

 I eat just as much as him at a meal and unlike him I don't eat breakfast, I don't snack, and I don't eat dessert. His comments are really bothering me and I truly think he thinks I am eating too much but I almost only eat one meal a day and don't always finish that meal. So idk why he is being so rude. 

He is also really pushy at trying to get me to eat any left overs. I don't know how to respond but it's pissing me off. It doesn't help that I have been having issues with bloating and gas lately. It makes me angry and I want to cry. I have never had issues with them outside of this. Idk what to do but I told him today I don't eat that much and he basically told me I was lying and he thinks otherwise (in somewhat of a 'joking' manner). At first I thought it was teasing but now I know it's not. Besides, he is probably 180 at the least with a dad bod so I feel like he is not in a place to judge me, a nearly anorexic teen that still wears smalls and mediums.

I don't want to be mean but I don't want to push this off cause I know it could escalate to a point that hurts me forever. How do I handle it? My first thought is to stop eating and leave the room when ever he does that but I feel like that's passive aggressive of me. My other thought was to just stop eating like I was before I moved but that led to a lot of health problems, probably why I am bloating and having a hard time digesting now that I am eating regularly-ish. 

The only thing I can think of that I do wrong when I eat is that I eat really fast. Growing up I just ate fast. We often ate in the car headed some where or right before leaving or going to bed. It's always been a rush to finish our food so it's really hard to eat slow. 

Ps: this is not the parents of my abusive mother, these are the parents of my non-abusive step father. "
"A lot of messed up stuff happened in my childhood, definitely things that should have never happened. I was always confused on whether my mom liked me or not. She'd say such cruel things to me and in the next breath act like we're best friends. She'd make fun of the way I looked, then copy my style. She'd act weird when I hang out with my stepdad and get jealous of me. I never knew what was true with her and what wasn't. I truly knew she didn't care about me after I told her about the weird stuff my step dad did. He kept pushing taboo topics and frankly disgusting sexual ideas towards me. Luckily he never did anything physical to me but that didn't make it any less messed up. I told my mother and she humiliated me in front of everyone then got mad at me. She stayed married to that man for 5 years after I turned 17 and moved out. It wasn't until recently she messaged me telling me that she believes what I said and is divorcing him. This all happened because he was secretly drugging her since I left. He also admitted to at least some of the weird stuff he said to me. 
After that I tried to reconnect with my mother but it didn't work out. She would bring up memories like they were happy occasions but I remembered it as exactly the opposite. I would see old glimpses of the woman I wasn't convinced and even like me. It was like she was desperately trying to pretend like everything was okay when it wasn't. After all that I wonder if I could ever really forgive her or trust her. I'm not really sure if she ever cared about me. I was always her least favorite child... "
"i don’t even know if she’s abusive or not but (as a girl) being around my own mother has affected the way i socialize with other women. she neglected me when i was born and my aunt was the one who raised me. she was more of a mother to me than she was. anytime i talk to her she yells at me and uses verbal abuse when i try to communicate. i’ve been told that i should respect her, and that i should ignore her, but how can i respect someone who’s been so awful to me? she acts nice to me only when she wants to be. her new relationship with her boyfriend has turned her into a worse person, she’s obsessed and she choose him over my sister and i. this hurts so much. 

i keep hoping that my mom will change and she will become a better person and i didn’t realize i had been hoping for this for 23+ years. this has been such an on going loop. i feel like i should hate her but i never could because she’s my mom. i can’t even move out because i don’t have a source… i feel abandoned by her almost. whenever i text her all she does is fight me and she blocks me. i feel awful. i feel desensitized towards her mistreatment towards me. i don’t know what to think of this.

"Something that makes me want to scream at people nowadays is how they think cartoons like The Secret of Nimh was traumatizing and they are only know realizing this. Or how they are so hardcore because they watched Faces of Death.

Traumatizing is having your mother put on porn to watch with you at 12 and up. Traumatizing is knowing if the day was going to be good or bad if she watched her brother/your uncles crime scene video and having his corpse in a red Mustang burned into your memory.

Please start teaching your kids the difference between reality and fantasy. 

And for the love of all that is holy and unholy please never watch porn with your kids. "
"I had a fight with my mom and she kicked me out. Told me she never wanted to see me again and many more nasty things. I didn't say a word to her. I have too much respect for her to say something back. I picked up my bags and left. I didn't want to speak to her, and the first thing she asked me through my dad was if I wanted to go to Disney with her. Not sorry. Not a hello. Not a hi. Nothing, just if I wanted to go with her somewhere after not speaking to her for almost two months now, what could that mean? That her only way of saying sorry was through money? I obviously said no, but it hurt."
"I’ve always felt like I was kind of weird. I want to say that I felt like I was different, but that would be a lie because I feel like everyone is unique. So, weird would be the word to describe me. Growing up, I was surrounded by family, but not in the way you might expect. During those times, my mom and dad would fight constantly, and I tried acting very unbothered, thinking it didn’t affect me because I wanted to be strong. My parents and I moved into a house in Miami, and my aunt who was in high school was living with us at the moment. My aunt was very smart. She was very brave for coming to Miami without her mom and dad in order to get a better education here, but she was constantly fighting with her Dad.

Later on, my Mom’s side of the family all came to move into our home from Honduras. It was chaos. I felt like I was watching a war. Everyone fought. My mom and my dad fought, my mom and my aunt fought, my grandpa and my grandma fought, my uncle and my aunt fought. It was exhausting at times, and the way I would cope would be to daydream. I loved to daydream. It felt like I was in my own little world away from everyone. It would sort of be my safe space where no one was able to touch me and where I wouldn't hear anyone.

My mom kicked out my grandpa, and eventually, everyone started to leave. I sort of felt relieved but also felt alone. I was always surrounded by people, and even though they were fighting, it was comforting to have everyone together. Since they were gone, my parents shifted their focus onto me and my sister. My mom holds a lot of anger in her, and to be honest, I can’t blame her. The things I heard about what she went through ate away at me. But she was very harsh with me sometimes, and I learned not to share personal things or do anything to give her a reason to yell, her words cut better than any knife.

 When I was younger, I would text my friends, and sometimes I would talk about my mom, which was almost never, and I mentioned how I thought she was scary. She checked my phone one day and looked through everything and saw that I said that about her. She was furious. I meant no harm in saying that, it was just she always yelled; I was oblivious when I was in the fifth grade. She screamed at me terribly. I remember she asked me, ""What are their parents going to think? I’m abusing you. Am I abusing you?"" I stopped talking about her after that. I never felt like I was close with her. What was the point?

"So to start this fiasco,
I woke up one morning, and immediately my abdomen was burning and felt super painful. I had nothing the night before in terms of pain, and no history of this ever happening. There's is however a history of appendicitis in my family. I tried standing up to go to the bathroom but I couldn't even stand up straight. I went to my mom's room and told her, ""Hey I think I need to go to the hospital"". Her response? Nope. Wait an hour.

So I'm sitting there on the couch in pain and feeling awful, and she's just sitting there, pretending nothing is happening. She then keeps asking me to rate my pain. I keep the numbers low only because in the past when I have told her about me being in real pain, she flips her shit and loses her mind. She then goes on to tell me how she has a migraine and how I should pity her and just shut up and deal with it. An hour later, I'm still in pain and she angrly decides I'm going to go to urgent care to prove her right.

So while we're driving to urgent care, I'm in the back trying to stay as still as possible to minimize the pain because it's really bad, and she sees that and hits EVERY speed bump possible. Making it so by the time we were actually at urgent care, I felt even worse.

We get in and the doctor sees me and is immediately like, yeah she should REALLY go to the hospital, like RIGHT NOW. And my mom sends me out of the room and I can here her telling the doctor ""oh she's lying, she's not sick, just tell her she should go home"" and thank GOD the doctor stood up to her and said ""this isn't a game, her life could really be at risk, do you want that on your conscious?""

So we drive to the hospital and the whole time she's telling me that I'm being so self absorbed for picking today to be sick and that I'm doing this to hurt her, and clearly this is a psychological problem with me. 

We get to the hospital and she watches me get checked in then fucking dips out of there. She then calls my neighbor and asks her to watch over me and leaves the entire state, not even joking. The doctors try to figure out what's wrong, they can't in the ER and they tell my to schedule somthing with my primary. So my neighbor brings me home, to which I discovered that she left entirely and I had no food. 

I then get a text later on that night and she rants about how her migraine was probably worse then any pain I had, and then she dodges all my calls and refuses to give me a date when she'll be back. 

As for my health, I don't give a shit anymore. I haven't taken any of the medicine, and Im not schedulling an appointment. I'm pretty uncaring of my life anymore and whether I live or die, so I don't care if I drop dead from this. Honestly I hope it happens, one so I can be free of this nightmare of a life I have, and so that they can finally see I wasn't faking it

"The title is the tldr really. 

This last Christmas I had a huge fight with mainly my mother and one of my sisters. It ended in crying, screaming, throwing stuff, the whole thing. 

I ended up leaving in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. After that I decided that this is it, I’m done. After all, I moved away from home a while ago, and I have a stable job. So I just went completely NC with my parents. 

But ever since then I’ve just felt, empty. It just feels like I’m all alone and like no one cares and that I’ve got no support system. Even though it’s not like my parents were much of a support system. 

There’s one thing my mother said that night that plays over and over in my mind. She said: “If I’m not there for you, who else is gonna be?”. And for some reason it feels like she was right. 

Thanks for reading. I really just wanted to get this off my chest. "

"(Please ignore anything grammar mistakes because english isn’t my first language and I don’t have a great vocabulary 😓)

I 15f have a dad that’s around early mid 40s. Ever since I could remember, my dad has always hit me for some kind of reason. (God bless my mommy, she never hit me, just yelled at me)I don’t remember most of them because I was very young but i’ll tell you the ones I do remember: When I was around 11-12 years old, I wanted to make some noodles to eat. I made some but I forgot the pot was still hot and like a dumb kid I didn’t use cloth to hold it. I was walking towards the kitchen table when I truly realized how hot it was. So I ended up dropping pot with all the noodles. My dad happened to see that and lucky for him, he had his belt on him. (you know what happened next.) 

The hitting has stopped for now but he’s still mentally abusive. I remember it so vividly. I was playing a game on my Ipad when I hear him call my name, so I go downstairs to see what he wants from me. “Go to the dishes. Ugh this house must be a pigs farm.” I got a lil annoyed at the pig joke so I ended making a little annoyed face. Unfortunately for me, he was right next to me while I was doing the dishes. He tells me to look at him with a slight annoyance and I look at him. “Why are u mad for? Stop making that face.” He rises his voice at me, and like my usual reaction I say, “This is how I always look.” And my dad goes, “ How dare you talk back to me!” and slaps me. I apologized and said i’ll fix my face so I smiled. Another similar situation happened but that time instead of slapping me he takes out a charging wire and starts hitting me. That was few months ago. 

Recently he started a truck job where he has to travel through states in North America. Few weeks ago, he called asking why I don’t call him,(like shouldn’t it be obvious)I ended up telling him I forgot and stuff. He’s usually out for 2-3 weeks and goes back to work in a few days.

Last time he came home, I was sleeping(12pm) and he calls me downstairs to clean the kitchen and do the dishes. He starts with his commenting again saying all that pig house stuff and how I as a women should be taking care of the house blah blah blah blah. I tuned him out because I was so tired of his nonsense. He was saying all that while in the kitchen with me so when he left, I start silently sobbing because I am still traumatized by him. I am afraid to stand up to him because he’s the “man of the house” crap. He recently started drinking too so I don’t know how much I have until he starts physically abusing me again. “I wish I could beat you again.” his words to me every once in a while.

Do I want my little sister in my life when I move out? No i hate her i wish she wasnt born because ive tried SO many times to mend our relationship as we are teenagers. Im sick of her and her rotten attitude that shes better than me.
My dad also tells me multiple times that im just like his older brother (his older brother was mentally and physically abusive to him) am i just not selfaware? Idk but my mom said i am not like his older brother that my dad hates. My dad hates me lowk"
"I joined this subreddit not even 4 hours ago and I just feel so fucking defeated. Everything kind of just sucks and I need a place to just ramble and hopefully I’ll feel better in the end. I don’t think my sister is in this subreddit or is even aware of its existence, and I really don’t want to make a throwaway. So, if you’re my sister, don’t read this because I’m not involving you in this shit show. 
Growing up, my sister (we’ll call her Ruth) was (and probably still is) my dad’s favorite. She’s 3.5 years older than me and was developmentally delayed to an extent. Ruth has auditory processing disorder, which is basically like dyslexia for hearing. She can’t focus on one sound with a bunch of background noise, so if you’re talking to her in an area with a lot of noise pollution, it’s hard for her to understand the first go around. My sister was born in 94, and the auditory processing disorder diagnosis came about in 95. She’s the oldest, so my parents were freaked out when Ruth wasn’t developing the way a normal child with no disabilities would. She couldn’t hear my parents talk to her half the time, so her speech was delayed. Before the diagnosis, my parents thought she would grow up to be put in a group home for adults. This never happened, because they figured out the issue and there was a treatment plan in place to help her through catching up with development and help her succeed in school. She turns 30 this year and I’m very proud of being her brother with all the hurdles she’s gone through with her auditory processing.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always felt like I wasn’t good enough for my dad. Nothing I did was good enough, even at 5 years old and dealing with bullying from girls at school because I was born a girl, transitioning when I was 18, and I didn’t fit the image of what the other girls wanted me to be. I got bullied a lot for things of that nature at school, and my sister also was bullied to some degree because of her disorder. She was always coddled by my dad, and I would get scolded. There was an instance of me being a kid and doing what kids do, my dad getting mad and picking me up and slamming against a closet door to yell in my face. When he let me down, I ran and hid in the pantry. He called my mom, sobbing and telling her he went too far. My mom didn’t know what exactly had happened until I had told her years later. 
It didn’t get better from there, because around 7 or 8, I told my mom I wanted my dad dead. I never had a good relationship with death growing up, because the finality of it all scared me and still does. If there were something serious that needed to be talked about, I always asked first if it was about death. All I knew about death at that point is that it’s the one thing that you can’t come back from, and if you’re dead, the person can no longer harm you. And that’s basically what it was. I didn’t describe how I wanted him dead, I just wanted him dead so he wouldn’t hurt me anymore. Terrified, my mom put me and my dad in therapy and I don’t really remember much about going through that. It didn’t fully fix things, but it healed them enough that I no longer would say that I wanted him dead. 
Don’t get me wrong, my mom and Ruth were also victims to my dad’s abuse. I just got the worst of it all. Ruth got slaps in the wrist compared to me and my mom. We weren’t raised religious, parents were both lapsed in their respective faith backgrounds, so Ruth and I were always (and still are) interested in learning about different religions. We learned a lot about Judaism, since my aunt and my cousin on my mom’s side are Jewish from how my grandparents raised them, but never a lot about Christianity. My dad has religious trauma from the religion and hated the notion of us even learning about God or Jesus or literally anything that had to do with the religion. We were (unfortunately) fans of a prominent Christian family shown on TLC and my dad hated that we watched the show. My sister had dated a boy in middle school who was Catholic, and my dad drilled into her about why she would want to convert to Catholicism when she was 14. That’s the kind of things Ruth would get. Meanwhile, I would get yelled at if I missed a goal during a soccer game, dropped a fly ball in softball, made any small mistake that a kid makes, etc. I was constantly trying to be better for my dad and I couldn’t never meet the high bar he had for me.
My parents divorced in 2012, but the start of it happened in 2009 when my dad was laid off from his job. He fucked us over financially because he never tried to get a good job again. He would get min wage jobs and get fired because he called off too much. He didn’t give a shit while my mom bent over backwards to make sure we survived. I won’t get into every detail of why he is the way he is, but it boils down to he’s never been allowed to hit rock bottom, he’s always had something there to catch him before he hits the ground. During them trying to work things out and not divorce, there was a time that my dad was screaming in my mom’s face, calling her every nasty name in the book, in the kitchen with me in the family room not even 20ft away and fully able to hear everything. I was on the computer and I wanted to escape to my room, but I remember thinking I couldn’t because if I did, my dad would bring me into the crossfires and use me against my mom. 
In 2013, the house they bought in 2007-2008 was foreclosed on and my mom and I moved about 40ish minutes to a different state and city. Ruth had just graduated high school, and I had just finished freshman year. I was furious that I was being ripped from everything I knew and blamed it on my mom when, looking back, it’s really my dad’s fault. I was an awful kid for sophomore and junior year, just very short, mean, and rude to my mom, and I regret it every day how bad I was. 2013 was also the year I went NC with my dad the first time. After various situations that happened around my birthday, one that I’ll talk about later, I went NC after my dad told me he wanted to see Ruth off to college after Thanksgiving and threw in my face how I wanted to see my then boyfriend on the day we usually see each other. The only good thing I can give to my ex is that he’s the reason why I got the guts to even go NC the first time. Ex was also not great, it would’ve turned abusive had the relationship continued, but that’s the one redeeming quality I can say about him.
I didn’t speak to my dad for 5 1/2 years. Over that time, my dad would lash out at my mom still, telling her that she’s feeding me lies about him so I don’t talk to him. Eventually, he seemed to get better. He’s an alcoholic, if he drank, he drank heavily, and he stopped drinking at some point during that time. I personally do not drink because of the things that occurred when he was drunk. It wasn’t much except he was incredibly scary and was more prone to yelling at people while intoxicated. He also went into therapy and started actually doing better.
During this time as well, my mom went through a cancer diagnosis (to which she has survived and been declared in remission) my junior year, at one point I saved her life after she collapsed from severe dehydration, graduated high school, had to move unexpectedly a month after graduation, went through trade school and got my hair license, transitioned and started HRT, found out the day after I got my license that we were being evicted, my mom and I were homeless for 2 months, and we finally got back on our feet by the time I started speaking to my dad again. I recognize that I’m dependent on my mom, still am as I live with her, but we are the only ones we can depend on. My aunt doesn’t live in the same state and my cousin lives overseas. During this period, Ruth was away at college so she couldn’t do much to help either. We only had each other, it’s been me and her against the world since 2012. We’ve struggled financially over the years but we always seem to make it work.
In March 2019, about two months before Ruth graduated from college, my dad and I met in a public place with my mom nearby to talk about everything that went on up until that point. From what I remember, a lot of the things I said to my dad were things he never considered and he seemed to take things to heart and wanted to change. This was the first of 3 times he has apologized to me. Things got better somewhat, but Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither do fixing strained relationships between a parent and child. For about a year after this, I tried initiating conversations about the past in gentle ways. Every time, he would freeze up and get very silent and I would feel like I had to change the subject every time. He never once tried talking to me about things whenever I brought them up and, after a while, I just stopped.
In 2022, I went NC a second time because he was hoenstly being a fucking dick over a car he had 0 ownership over. I had gotten a car the previous August and it was a stupid purchase, if only because I spent what I paid for in car payments in repairs as well during the first year alone. He tried telling me not to do something with it, I don’t remember what, and I told him
not to contact me until I reached it to him. This lasted 2 months, we met in a public place again with my mom and this time his girlfriend and talked things out again. This is the second time he’s ever apologized to me.
A common theme of all this is I’m not a priority to my dad. My dad can talk about the trauma he went through growing up, the trauma he caused my mom and assumedly my sister (we don’t talk about our dad in that way, I’m not putting Ruth in the middle of all this and she is the type to want to find a solution even if there is none), apologize to my mom on numerous occasions, often unprompted, but I can count on one hand how many times he’s apologized to me. The third time happened last year out of the blue, where he called me crying about how he feels bad for ruining our relationship for the years we didn’t speak and he wanted to make things right. I felt it was genuine, and I had thought this was opening a door to future discussions. It did not, obviously, since I’m here writing this post.
The weekend of mother’s day, my dad sent me and Ruth several screenshots of a trauma dump he did on a social media site. I didn’t read any of it, frankly, it pisses me off still that he even dumped that on us out of the blue not even considering the circumstances, and I ignored the conversation he and Ruth had about it. I vented to my mom about it, saying that it hurt that he can just dump his trauma on me but I can’t do the same for the trauma he caused me. Later that evening, my dad texted my mom and apologized for the millionth time for a situation she doesn’t even remember. She told my dad he shouldn’t be apologizing to her, as he has numerous times in the past already, and that he should really apologize to me. There was a little back and forth, and eventually my dad texts me the next day asking what my mom meant. So I told him. I told him how I’ve never felt like I was a priority to him, how I wasn’t even on the list of people to make amends with, how I never felt good enough for him no matter what I did, and how I had to basically coddle him talking about this in the past. I told him how it hurt knowing that he’s apologized to my mom so many times yet I can count on three fingers the times he’s apologized to me. I told him it feels shitty to see him be open about his own trauma but I can’t do the same to him. Eventually, I mentioned how I knew Ruth had always been his favorite. That is what set him off. He told me that he didn’t have a favorite child, it was a bullshit statement, and that he no longer wanted to have this conversation over text. I said I would only meet with him if my mom could be there to mediate, because I’m not trusting him to do this alone. He agreed, told me to pick a time and place, and we would meet. He even texted my mom saying he understood why I wanted her there and thought it was a good idea.
The next day, I decided on a park in the city I finished high school in, we have an elderly dog with anxiety and it would be easier to do that than to find a sitter, and texted him asking if that park was okay at this time. He messages me back to ask why that park. I asked, why does it matter? You told me to pick a place and I did. He sends back, well, the last time we were meant to meet at this park, you stood me up. 
This is the situation I alluded to earlier. Because during this time I wasn’t the best, my mom had taken my phone away. I had either just turned 16 or about to, and there was a rally for a tax levee that the marching band was playing at. The rally was at the park I chose. My dad was meant to pick me up from the park so we could go celebrate my birthday. The city I graduated HS from is very small, I lived right behind the high school and I could get to this park in 20 minutes, if not faster. When I couldn’t find my dad, and having no way of getting into contact with him, I figured I would walk home and, if he couldn’t find me at the park, he would assume the same. He didn’t. Instead, he called to yell at my mom, blaming her for why he couldn’t find me and how shitty she is, then yelled at me in the car once I got in. I was a sophomore in HS at this point, 16 or nearly there. I was a kid. I didn’t “stand up” my dad on purpose.
Things went back and forth from there. I told him he’s holding a grudge for over 10 years at this point, that I also have bad memories with this park (HS ex broke up with me at this park in the worst and cold hearted way), and that I didn’t choose this park as a malicious attack against him. I honestly chose the park because it’s small, I know the park well enough that, in the event one of us gets lost, it would be easy to find each other. It’s a fucking park. He didn’t put any stipulation on where it could be, so I chose that park. He told me he doesn’t feel comfortable meeting at this park because I stood him up and tried using my bad memories as a gotcha on why we should change locations. I stood firm, telling him that this is an uncomfortable situation and he should feel uncomfortable. I said we are doing this by my terms, we are meeting at this park or it’s not happening at all. 
He throws back, okay, we can do it at the park, but your mom can’t be there. I said no, we are doing this on my terms or not at all. I stood firm on this, even going as far as threatening to go NC again if he didn’t meet me where I stood. I’ll be honest, I only said it as a scare tactic because he’s admitted to my mom he’s scared of me going NC again. Except he didn’t blink at the threat, just kept going on about how I’m being unreasonable and he isn’t responsible for the stories I make about him in my head, basically calling me delusional. So I told him not to contact me again. I blocked him everywhere, including his number. I messaged his girlfriend to inform her of the situation, telling her if he tries to contact me through her, I will block her as well.
Since then, it’s been hell. I have a laundry list of medical issues, a lot of them being nerve issues. I had carpal tunnel at 18 and got surgery for it while in hair school. I’ve known the whole time I’ve been cutting hair I’m doing so on borrowed time, and this year, I started college to get a degree for when I can no longer do hair. My hands started being an issue again in March. I figured it’s because I take handwritten notes and I cut hair, and it’ll go away once the semester ends. It didn’t, it only got worse. 3 weeks after the end of the semester, my right wrist started hurting but didn’t impede on my work. Until a week later when I had to leave work to go to urgent care because the pain was too much for me to cut hair. I tried cutting hair again the next day, same thing and again, it happened the day before I saw ortho. X-rays looked fine, so I was ordered an MRI that didn’t happen until about 2 weeks ago. MRI doesn’t show anything except normal wear and tear, and my only next step is to get an EMG (a nerve test). If that’s inconclusive, I’m shit out of luck. 
Because it hurts to cut hair, my hours at work have been cut significantly. I can only reception work on the weekends, so I’ve received a 20 hour cut, plus the tips I’d normally get to help beef up my paycheck aren’t there. I’ve already been struggling keeping my head above water since January of this year, and right before my current round of medical issues, I was almost in the clear. My pay has been cut to 20%, if that, of my normal weekly take home. I don’t qualify for help through United Way, the things I need help paying (car payment for a car I purchased after the lemon I had, loans, and credit cards) aren’t listed as options. My mom is lucky to work for a fantastic hospital and covers the majority of our bills, but she’s getting a total shoulder replacement 8/2. She does have short term through her employer, so at least there’s that.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m trying to find a job, but nobody will call me back for an interview. I keep getting rejection after rejection. The one interview I’ve had didn’t hire me, though that manager is trying to get me hired at a different store but who knows. I have bills to pay and I’m only getting a fraction of what I normally get. I’m home all the time and I feel so fucking helpless. I’m reaching my fucking limit on what I can handle. Nothing good has happened to me since going NC. I feel worthless and stupid. I feel like I’m annoying all my friends because I have too much time. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what can be done at this point. I’m lucky I still have health insurance through my job, and I need good health insurance with the amount of medical issues I have. I’m scared every day and I feel like
I’m going to throw up constantly. My appetite is shit, I’ll go hours without eating and only do so when my blood sugar drops low enough my CGM alerts me of it, if I do eat, I have to eat my safe foods because I will go through making something, only to sit down, maybe take a bite or two, before my body decides that it doesn’t want that. My sleep is shit, even worse than during the semester. I feel like I’m on the verge of a panic attack constantly and I don’t want to burden my friends when they have their own shit. I’ve asked for help from friends and family, and only 3 people and $45 have come my way.
I don’t know anymore. I feel like I’m being punished for cutting out my dad again. I know I’m not, it’s just a coincidence, but I can’t help but feel that way. Everything was fine for a week after the semester ended to this all starting. Nothing bad happened until I went NC. I wonder if things would get better if I reached out, but I know it will only cause me more stress. I feel like I’m drowning and everyone is watching and not helping.
Thanks for reading if you do. Be kind to one another."
Ik many people may have this problem but why dose my father just throw things at me and act like he never did?
"So I noticed my dad does this thing where he will listen to my conversations with my sister, mom etc, and I obviously won’t know. It can be something as simple as my sister and I talking about my door sagging and my sister saying someone should fix it. This happened weeeeks ago. A very unimportant comment in my opinion? Today my sister “lazily” closed my door (according to my dad) so the door made an awful noise when it hit the ground. My dad said something along the lines of “I heard you say it should be fixed but you can just lift the door don’t be fuckin lazy.” This time his remark was more tame but there have been multiple times in the past where he will bring something up and sort of use it against me, without me knowing he knew about it. It will mostly be conversations. I sometimes feel betrayed by this.

Am I overreacting? I feel like I have ptsd and am easily triggered. I have been feeling more sensitive since attending therapy and while I have progressed a lot in the past year I feel like I have a long way to go. The fact that Im easily triggered makes me feel like Im going backwards, but my therapist says it might be because I’m surpassing things and setting boundaries so it opens up some past trauma. "
"I'm going to be short, I have parents who abused me when I was little, they liked me to participate in their sexual acts, first as a spectator and collaborator in certain acts such as cleaning my father's genitals with a stocking or inflating used condoms; The most thing they made me do was clean my father with my mouth, they laughed and so did I, I was little and I didn't really understand what happened until I was eleven years old.

All my life they denied what happened, to the point of making me doubt myself, but they continued their abuse, mocking me, hitting me, and humiliating me in every way possible (typical narcissists).



As an adult, when they were divorced, my mother kicked me out of the house and it was only then that I was able to get away from them and have contact 0

Today I am married (marriage in trouble) and with a 5-year-old son who is the best thing in the world, my wife does not believe what happened to me, perhaps because I never gave her specific details (it is difficult for me to give them, he was very small and those ""games"" with my parents were not traumatic events like my mother's beatings were for example) but the fact is that I am firm that if it happens and she says that my parents do not seem like the kind of person who would do that (as if they were carrying a sign that says ""I'm a pedophile"")

my problem:

Yesterday I fooled myself that I was going to take our son to his night job and then with her to a friend's house and in reality he was at my mother's house, I hate her for that, as soon as I found out we argued, I still haven't seen in person at the time of writing this

I love her with all my soul and it makes me cry to have to abandon her, but I don't see any other way out, although if I stopped being close to him maybe my son would be more at risk.



What should I do?"
"Hello! 

Upon reading some post here, most are relatable to my family and my background. 

I’m 22 years old, I work as a call representative full time. I learned to drive on my own because my dad was physically abusive to me as a teenager. He would punch me in the face and spray coke soda on my face. He would turn off the lights and internet to prevent me from submitting my homework. I believe this is what started my cycle of just giving up things I start. 

My mom has pulled my hair, called me ugly, bruised me, and told me to kill myself. 

At 22 years old, I want to move out. I want to go back to school for the sciences. 

Not for them. But for me. 

The thing is I don’t know what I want to do for school. When I went to community to figure it out, my dad punched me in the face during it so I withdrew. 

I know that I can’t enter school while living in an abusive home. But I want to leave. I want to move on. 

What advice would you provide on an escape safe plan with the goals I have? 

Thank you for any upcoming advice. 

And for those experiencing the same, I haven’t gone out of the situation yet, but know you aren’t alone and there’s a way out. Keep going and dream big, don’t let your parents limit you and break the cycle. "
I just need some hope
"I and my younger sisters experience daily emotional and physical abuse from my mother. I don't know what to do. Even today my back got whooped with wire only because I didn't wanted to go to store. Everyday my mother reminds me of how much of a mess i am and without me i would die. My feelings and opinions disregarded. She tells me to kill myself if I don't like something in house. She would constantly remind me of how whore i am and all i can do is please men, even though i never had friends(mainly because she shit my friends behind their back and would always tell me to stop talking to them or else she will break my face or phone ).  She would make fun of me and call me r word for having obvious autistic behaviour. I can't draw or have any hobbies, because what i do is always ""pointless and will only slow me down"". She threatened me that she will break my hands, if i keep drawing. She would remind me how much i look like my father. I hate my father. She throws at me heavy things or even worse, knifes. She would whoop my back if i do something bad like disagree with her. She would beat me even in public. And this whole stuff happens to my siblings too! I feel like it's going to be only worse as time passes. I actually consider harminh myself and i lost all my motivation because of her. I can't call CPS because none of them will take the problem seriously. My father is abusive too, he's not the type of person who would help or love. No relatives will take care of us. I'm scared for my little sisters and myself, i cant do anything. I want normal life but idk how to get it without being left with no home and money to survive"
"When I was learning to drive with my dad, it was a constant barrage of criticism, running commentary, shouting, and being treated as though I was an idiot.

It got to the point where I tried to avoid going out for drives, as I couldn't take his abuse. 

I've had enough. Once I've passed my practical test (UK) and have my own car again, I won't be taking him as a passenger."
"hello, this is my second time posting on reddit and i’m still not sure if i’m doing anything wrong but basically, my dad has been very emotionally and physically abusive towards me and my mother, though i have a younger brother me and my mum are always protecting him from my dads aggression and beatings. i’m 17 and am gonna be 18 in less than a year and i could leave this situation then and live with friends but i want to leave with my mum and little brother, i can’t leave them behind. my mum has been with him for over 25 years tho and i believe she’s been manipulated throughout their relationship to believe there isn’t any help out there for us. so she doesn’t really feel like we should and obviously she’s scared of him too. i forgot to mention but he’s really bad especially when he’s drunk but honestly it seems like he’s never sober now; hes drinking everyday so it’s been a rough couple of weeks. 

onto the part about leaving though. i’m not sure if women’s shelters would take us all as i am nearly an adult and idk if we could stay long term until we can find somewhere to live but i just want out i can’t deal with this anymore (i live in england if that helps with your advice) ive spoken to my mum a few times recently (past few months) about this but nothing ive said really gets her to understand we would be better without him so please if you have any advice for services i can talk to which dont contact the police instantly please comment. i want to be sure there’s a plan in place before doing anything because i want us to be safe before anything.

"My best friend, who I will be calling Duck, has an emotional abusive mom and I want to get the police involved.

  
Duck is 12 while I am 13, she is like a sister to me. We grew up together, even lived with each other for 2 years. her mom is a really crappy parent. She does not give Duck privacy, lets her boyfriend call her names and laughs about it, favorites Duck's younger brother over her, and this morning she told Duck she doesnt care about her feelings. Plus a lot more is happening.

  
Now as a kid who also has an abusive mother figure, I understand what its like, though Duck has it way worse. I want to help any way I can. Duck's dad is very supportive of her and we already have told him everything going on. He has been trying to get custody of Duck for a while now and I want to help him as much as possible.

  
At first I wasnt sure if I should get involved but I don't really care anymore, I will do anything for Duck at this point to get her out of that house.

  
What I plan to do is first get evidence. I am going to tell Duck to try to record a few times when her mom is being a jerk. Then next time I go over to Duck's house for a sleepover I am going to call the police, I will tell them everything and show them the evidence Duck recorded. I want to be there in case things get bad with her mom. Currently her mom is pregnant but should be giving birth soon so hopefully she wont be pregnant by the time this happens for the sake of Duck's little sister.

  
I try my best to support Duck and I try to plan as many sleepovers and hangouts as possible to get her out of her mom's house. I comfort her when things get hard and give her advice. She knows how bad her mom is too and hates it. Both of us are hoping to get her away from her mom. 

  
If anyone has any advice on how to get her dad full custody or make the police actually take any of this seriously, I will happily take it. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I went out to my friends bday party and I came home at a reasonable time (10 pm) and my dad was so mad. I am 20 and he is telling me i have to ask him for permission whenever im going out. and everytime i come back from somewhere fun with my friends they ruin my mood at the ride back home. i am so tired of being depressed at home i wanna be happy. i hate my parents. he is punishing me for going out by making me wake up at 9 am to cook breakfast for everyone. i feel like a maid in my own house. i havent even properly got time to sleep 
"My relationship with my father has been complicated. He's told me before that if any other parent had to deal with me they would've left a long time ago. Lately he's been telling me how he hates his life and how he doesn't get anything out of going to work and providing for everyone. Not just with him but with my mom as well, I feel like a trauma dump for both of them. Both of them complain to me over and over again not only about each other, but about their own upbringings. Even after I got sent to a psych ward due to self harming, they didn't bother to even try to change one bit. But back to my main point, my dad told me not to be surprised if he drives himself off a cliff and even went as far as to ask me if I'd forgive him if he killed himself. So I'm really worried about him now and if he does do it, its gonna be my fault and I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. Earlier today he was yelling at me for not sleeping with my ex(It was my first relationship so I wanted to take it slow but that's a whole other topic)and he said that it’s my fault she left me. Then he went on to talk about how sex should be my number one priority as an 18 year old boy. At that point I just broke down crying to which he started yelling at me asking me why I was crying and threaten to leave for good if I don't tell him why. He didn't seem to have even an ounce of sympathy. A couple days later when I told him that she broke up with me, I got yelled at like 3-4 times. Even when I asked him to leave me alone multiple times he just kept continuing to yell and yell at me. He went on to tell me that it's all my fault because I didn't sleep with her. He then went on to tell me (yelling) how women only want two things: sex and money. and when I don't listen to him, he again, threatens to leave the family and take everything away. I feel like I'm watching my whole family fall apart and there's nothing I can do about it. If you read my last post, you know my ""family"" isn't really a family. I just want all of this to end. All I wanted was I don't know, a hug from my father? That would've been nice... maybe for him to not yell at me when I need his support the most? A couple weeks ago he told me about how if he was like everyone else, he would’ve disowned me a long time ago. I feel so alone... not even my own family cares about me it seems like... I've been considering another suicide attempt and I'm really scared."
"Im 18 yrs old, live in the PH and I think it's time for me to voice out about what my parents did to me.

Mom currently threw a plastic plate in my head which resulted to gush out a lotta blood. I only stopped the bleeding when I finally apply cloth to it. The worst part is? My lil sis witnessed this whole situation. It would be really traumatic for her despite not really knowing what's going on. Ofc this includes myself as I'm crying and panicking a lot when it bled.

I would've gotten stitched my head but I don't really have enough money for it so it's really difficult. Physically I'm dealing with a headaches, fatigue, bruise and swelling (mostly at my head injury) and mentally I am dissociating, depressed, and confused.

I only got checked up publicly so since I can't get it stitched- i drink a lot of antibiotics and painkillers. It's what the doctor prescribed to me. However the healing process won't be fast. I know.

I won't get a job for a while bc of my head injury. I don't wanna think too much as- this triggers me more headaches.

Anyways back to what my parents did. They were ashamed of what they did. But I fear they might do this again. Since in their minds I believe they have some sort of generational trauma where abuse was tolerated and won't really realize that it's fully wrong. Mentally they also emotionally abused me a lot. And I haven't responded to them nicely which yeah- resulted to put myself in a dangerous situation.

I would've report them to the authorities but I have the fear of them going to prison. I only want them to realize that it's wrong. I don't want their lifetime to be spent in prison.. I don't want gossips to be heard all over by my neighbors or my relatives, coz yeah that would be really stressful for me and my lil sis.

So I just had to make excuses about the cause of my head injury. Like I got tripped at the corner. (When that's not rlly the cause I know, kind of pains me)

Currently she's taking care of my wound which is expected because it's my mom's fault. But its kinda really boring to stay here at bed for the whole day. And when I get better, I'm looking forward to get out because it's dangerous to put myself and my lil sis here for too long. 

It's not always they'd do something this physically abusive. But yeah I always fear it gets there due to their lack of emotional management/intelligence.

And about my dad.. he was not there when this situation happened. Since he's currently working. Ofc it is frustrating for him to witness this. But it seems like he's not really taking this as a big deal so.. I'll say that dad hasn't been the greatest dad himself. He's got a past history where he hurts my mom and is a massive cheater.

This family is just messed up and I don't know what to do except to escape outta here."
"So my Mother is now a bit older (64) and i just got 20 years old (Male). I think i have been verbally, emotionally and physically abused for my, i dont know, whole life. One of my problems is that i dont see how i can get out of this situation and the other is that i feel great shame and guilt. I always ask myself if i was better, would it be that bad? 

To state some things that she did for context:

-Once when i was 13 years old, i wanted to go with a friend (girl) of mine, which i really loved and cared for for a outdoorpool. To just hang out a bit with her and some other friends of our class. My mother had a little nap. I had to wake her up so she lets me out of the house, because back then, if i didnt tell my mother i would go outside, she wouldnt let me in, till we would clash again for an hour. So i woke her up to tell her i go outside. She then bashed out, screaming loud asf, and then took a knife and rushed at me. I fell backwards on my back running from here and hit my head (ouch) and started crying really hard because i really got scared. Dude i  really thought i was about to die, and that that was it. This was the first time she rushed at me with a knife and where i got hella scared. There were many other times she did it, where she said shed kill me and stuff but i kinda got used to it over time, so i wasnt scared anymore that much. 

-She verbally abused me my whole life, told me i was shit, that i was dumb, that i cant sit still ( ihave diagnosed adhd but she doesnt give a shit), cant behave, that i should fuck my self (even at a young age!). There were thousand different things she told me. And the thing is that i dont give a shit about it no more. She still slurs at me to this day. When i think about it: It scares me, that i dont care. Do you guys get that feeling? I told my new GF about this topic with my mom and she was so surprised and stuff and told me that she couldnt imagine that. I was kinda confused because i didnt think its a big deal to that point. I knew i was getting abused, but was it really that bad, i was asking myself. I was reassuring myself, that this happens also to other etc.

-She bite me multiple times, literally. It kinda hurt and i was confused and scared. I was kinda young.

-I cant wear the things i want, and if so, i have to go through a big Conversation (AT 20 YEARS OLD BRUH)

-She forced me to go to school and be a doctor lmao (the normal thing immigrant parents do). Well now im starting with University but im studying History and Philosophy (for the start: i might switch up some things; literature interest me as an example). My mother is really disappointed in me because i want to study in these fields. Well, i actually believe she has a valid point in this critic as a parent. But still, these fields are what interest me the most and what i love to do.

-I just finished school last month, and she then told me that i am a lazy prick that doesnt go to work, because i had some freetime. I then found a job, applied and got accepted. It pays decent and its a cool job because you help people in need and i thnik thats better than workin in Mcdonalds feeding into the consumerism of people nowadays. Well, as i got the job, she said: No YOU CANT HAVE A JOB, YOU HAVE UNIVERSITY STARTING. And i got confused because she told me to get one, now i got one and then this. And then she tells me paranoid shit like: They might sell your organs and kidnap you (Btw my mother is blatantly stupid, im glad im adopted and have not this monkey genes in common with her, but she is still my mother) Then she told me that i have to give her bank account info so the money goes to her. When i said no she screamed, hit me (it didnt hurt, but the screaming is hella annoying), then wanted to call to my job and say i wnt do it (bruh?)

- She physically abused me in my childhood, where i was a really vulnerable child. She doesnt hit me nowadays as much, because she realized that i dont give a f\*uch about her. She got weak.

- She is sick and constantly tells me that she is dying and i dont know what to do. Well she goes to the doctor and does all the stuff yk. But it still hurts her telling me that she is going to die. She always plays this card when were arguing. For example when i want to go out for a little while, she tells me that shes sick and is dying. (She aint even that sick for context, she still is able to perform as good in life as before, she just gets into these sick phases some times. and then i have to do everything. She mainly does the cooking and the rest is often up to me like cleaning etc.)

- My mother acts as if im her property. She wants to decide everything about my life, she wanted to marry me to a girl i absolutely hated, i refused, she screamed the shit out of her soul, got nearly a heartattack, proceeds to give the faults to me

- Often when i want to go out with the boys she overcomplicates everything and says that i love my friends more than her Blah blah blah. Im not even going out for a party or doing drugs. Then she wants to call the police because of my behaviour. (i was fucking 19 years old, is this normal dude i cant even get out of the House man) She ends up calling her brother for reassure herself and tells him how bad i am etc. her brother always tells her to just let me do these tings and that it is normal. Btw My whole ass family back in my country hates me because of the portrayal my mother gives of me, but they dont like her that much either (I fully understand them)

-She is the most irresponsible human being i have ever come across. She always gaslights me into thinking every wrong doing of her is because of ME. Occasionally, when she walks and just nearly slips, she screams at me, for no reason. I believe she is emotionally unstable. 

- She hates  one of the only person i love right now and wants to ruin our relationship. For Context im from Swtizerland, my mother is an immigrant from Kosovo. We both live in switzerland and she alsways accused me of becoming too much like a swiss peson. I always rebuttal, i tell her that i just want to be myself and that i dont see myself as albanian nor swiss because i always tell her that i dont give a fuck about nationality. My girlfreind (19 years old) is such a cool person, i love it. But she is swiss, which is no problem for me, but for my mother. We often fight over her. She tells me i have to marry an albanian girl. I hate albanian people, i dont know why, just had bad experiences with them. I dont want to generalize things, but i guess im a bit racist then.

- My mother is hyperconservative, traditonalisitc, hella racist, hateful about everything, nationalistic, dogmatic, and really into islam. (I left islam. I kinda hate religion. Islam in particular. The arrogance of it surprises me) 

- She always makes me feel guilty about everything that happen to her. Telling me i cant leave her or else bad things will happen (guess what)

- She doenst know how to talk about topics formally and constructive. Evrything she says is destructive and dogmatic and dude im dead angry about it. Im always surprised when i see others talking to their mothers like normal people. Dude HOOOOOW????!!

- My dad died. I believe my mother is overly controlling because of that, because she has noone left. Her husband is dead, he suddenly died in an accident, which is why my mother doenst let me go out of the house without a big dispute. I believe my mother is a really broken person.

- When i told my mother that i have a psychiatrist she got angry at me and told me to not say anything that happens under the house (so the main problems in my life) I told her that i just wanted to know ways to handle shte stress of schoold better with adhd etc (I never had stress in school, it was easy and i had never put any effort in it, and only skipped classes, I mean i still passed everything so all good). She didnt belive me and hit me, screamed at me, and then i cried again. 

- My mother is ashamed of me and openly tells everybody about it, how ugly i am, how dumb i am, how i only read books ( i dont know what her fucking problem is abot reading and i am not even that ugly my girlfriend is a hell of a grilfriend, really pretty and she thinks i am pretty too.

Now to the bigger problem. I sometimes feel great shame and guilt about the life of my mother and i cant imagine the pain i would feel if i cut her off. She would feel lonely. Sometimes it feels as my responsibility to make sure she might have a good life. I told my Psychiatrist that i really feel bad for my mother and that i want to help her but its hard and i dont know how. My teacher told me i should get out, but its hard. THIS is so easy said but its hard, its not even a financial thing dude, just the emotional thing that destroys me. My psychiatrist told me about that i have built a defensive mechanism because of my mother, which explains my emotinal numbness sometimes. But sometimes i have moments of great psychological pain where i start crying and feel bad about everything that has happened. Im sure my mother had a really hard life but i dont know what to do i feel so stressed about it and pressured. I just cant figure it out. Everyone tells me to just get away but it feels wrong to leave a broken person behind alone!! How is she gonna manage? How is she going to feel? I think its blatanlty egoistic to just leave her behind. I mean doesnt she need help too? She might be just as broken as i am right now? I mean i already feel bad about not spending much time with her, i berricade myself in my room so to speak haha. 

Anyway, my qustion is.. How would you handle such a situation without moving out? I want to have a good relationship with my mother. I really do. Thank you for reading:

Here is some things about me (I have also flaws)

- I have ADHD, which is why i am really disorganized and forgetful

- I am a very lazy person

- I am very sarcastic and too open. I am very direct, which sometimes can hurt people, but i dont mean it with bad intent.

- I had a phase where i locked all my emotions up and never told anyone about it (Now i feel in very good touch with them)

- I am suicidal

- I am a very indifferent person at times, and i rather laugh at my life than take it seriously ( My best cope)

- My humour can get very mean to peoples feelings

- I am everything my mother hates and the reason why she feels ashamed, she thinks i looks homeless and ugly and she wants to cut my hair off make me bald bro i dont want to be bald. 

- I am very insecure about my self (My girlfriend helps me with this, i love her so much dude, i love love its so fascinating how she can see love me so much, i miss her rn :( Im seeing her on thursday :D

- I have anxiety issues but im trying to fix them

- I am overly self critical

- I have hated myself for a long time, and was really afraid of making bounds with other people

- I can get disrespectful towards authority figures 

- My mood is shifting very often

- Im very cyncial and nihilistic, really pssimistic at times

So yeah thats about me. ive seen most people on here only pointing out flaws about their parents so here also about me so you have a bigger picture of us.

"So I contacted the authorities on my parents and they're aware that social services are coming round to our house on Thursday this week. My parents were extremely shocked and angry and now I feel like I was being dramatic and I want to kill myself. Like my parents are going to flip out about what i said, about how they're abusive and how I tried to kill myself multiple times. 

I honestly need to know what I should do and need comfort honestly.

"I'm a 26 year old woman and a friendless neet,I'm stuck living with my family and I suffer of some kind of untreated mental illness that gives me rage attacks and I tend to fight a lot with my siblings and my parents, but the latter always tend to be more sweet to my siblings and angrier with me, even when I'm in the right.
Also neither mum or dad believe I have psychological problems and think I'm just a lazy person who enjoys doing nothing all day and being always alone (last time I had friends was 10 years ago) so they do absolutely nothing to try to help me in a serious way.
Yesterday I had a rage attack and mum and dad told me to take my own life while pointing to the balcony and today mum laughed at me while I was having a panic attack which made me suicidal and I don't know what to do anymore,I just wanted help to understand if they are abusive or it's all my fault."
"(tw for swearing, and suicidal ideation) so i (15), live with my mom the majority of the time, my parents are divorced so i see my dad a few months out of the year. my mom is pretty damn abusive. Im still coming to terms with it but she has done a whole bunch of shit that is 100% abusive or neglectful. A few of them are leaving the house, turning the internet off and never telling me where she was going or if she was coming back, threatening (and actually doing it at one point) to take my door off, also picking the lock to my room, I literally had to use duct tape to tape it shut so she wouldn’t break in.

I have an eating disorder also, but she just refuses to even attempt to understand it. She will buy a bunch of food that I literally cannot eat and then will get upset that im not eating anything. She always plays the victim, always. I called her out on it once and she just straight up walked away and refused to apologize. every single thing i do is her fault. I cant get out of bed? Oh poor mom, dealing with such a lazy child. Room isnt clean? Im so sorry i let this continue for so long, im such a bad parent. not finishing schoolwork on time? We should send you to your dads, you always finish schoolwork there.

speaking of dad, yeah, he also fucking sucks. Like genuinely he is the worst human being i have ever met. Mom knows about this too, she just refuses to comfort me because ”you have to see him again eventually, so theres no point in complaining. Oh yeah, hes also borderline transphobic, and also sort of homophobic. I came out as asexual a while ago and he just straight up said i was lying and i will change my mind. He refuses to take any accountability for why i very vocally hate being at his house. Its always that the dogs are too loud, or that bedtime is 8 pm (which ??? I mean yeah it sucks but its not abusive), or that i just hate my sister. Shes really young, like less than 5, and shes actually way nicer and genuinely the only reason why i dont fight to hell to not go there. I love her more than anyone else is that house, and shes the only reason im considering not fully cutting contact when i turn 18, and probably why I haven’t killed myself yet.

anyways, he constantly makes fun of my interests, my appearance, my clothes, my friends. Everything he can make fun of in some way he will. I wanted a computer and got so much shit for calling the computer a she, like i just thought it was pretty?? people with boats do that too, you didnt have to make fun of me for a straight hour at a restaurant, in front of people. He also will rant about how he has to “dumb down his language“ around people and how smart he is. how much of a good father he is. He literally gave me a fucking trauma disorder, and then parades around like hes father of the year because he didnt immediately murder me for saying i might be nonbinary. Still makes a bunch of transphobic jokes, and also misgenders me all the fucking time.

he yells at me constantly. He yells at literally everyone actually. my sister, our dogs, our cats, anyone he can yell at, he will. I got screamed at for leaving an empty soap bottle out, my mom reuses them, i forgot he didnt. And i got fucking screamed at so hard i started crying, over a fucking soap bottle. oh, also he jokes about things i say either when i was crying or during an argument. Its his fault as much as moms, because shes the one who tells him everything i say. I am five seconds away from either completely staying in my room 24/7, or killing myself. Dont know which yet.

yeah, thats pretty much it, ANY advice would be helpful, i am genuinely unsure of what to do. Sorry if the grammar is sloppy, i just really needed to vent. edited it to clear something up and general grammar"
"I dont really know what to say. My parents had a huge argument. As they have for a long time now, I couldnt handle it anymore and I opened their room door and joined in against him. He disrespected my mom, my entire family on her side and me. He started calling me things and started telling me to come st him if im such a “big boy.” I charged at him, didnt really hit him, just pushed him down against his bed and my mom tried pulling me off, but as soon as he got bsck up i pushed him right back down. I hate myself for it. Although my family fought a lot, things were slightly showing signs of improvement, but now he threatened to call the police, file for a divorce and try to take my sister(his and my moms) Forgive me if this has gramatical errors or if its completely incomprehensible, my minds all over the place."
"Hi I’m 15 years old. I made this account because I need help on what to do. I have tried to reach out before to child protective services and absolutely nothing was done about my situation. My mother has always been physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my younger sister who is 10. Yes, it has affected me but I’ve learnt to cope with it and I’m doing okay. My sister on the other hand is not okay with it at all. My sister is completely dependent and attached to my mother. I’ve seen it before but I only realized the extent of it tonight. My sister wasn’t being very nice to my mother so she locked her out of her bedroom (that is where my sister sleeps every night) my sister began crying and banging on her door to let her in and when she did they began screaming at each other. Both of them calling each other crazy. My mother threatened to take her to the hospital to get her “mental help” (she would never do this because she’s scared that she will get caught for everything she is doing. I was in therapy for a day and I wasn’t allowed to go again because of this) My mother then began to try and drag my sister out of my room so I interfered and took my sister out. I sat with her in the living room for a few minutes and then left to go to my room. She then began hysterically crying and couldn’t breathe (I’m not sure if it was a panic attack of some sort) I kept going back to try and get her to calm down. She told me she was scared of my mother. Later when she calmed down I told her to sleep in her bedroom. She said she couldn’t. I told her that she can’t sleep with my mother for the rest of her life and she needs to start now. She began crying again saying she couldn’t. She is too attached to my mother and I’m scared of what it will lead to. This has happened in many other situations before. What should I do?"
"
My mother prioritizes spending on herself and her boyfriend over my siblings and me. Last month alone, she spent $100 on lingerie while I've only received a $10 pair of jeans in the past year, despite the fact that my clothes look really worn out. I've stopped complaining because begging her only results in being screamed at and getting called spoiled. She basically saves any money that she should spend on her kids, so that she can invest it in her own stupid stuff.

Recently, I asked her to buy a $30 music event ticket for me as everyone in my class is attending. Normally, I would never spend this much, but I have been excited about this since months and was overjoyed when my friends asked me to go with them. Despite initially agreeing and purchasing them, she abruptly changed her mind within like 5 minutes. Now she insists I give her the money back and has resorted to insulting and calling my friends “retards”. She labeled me an ""asshole"" and sternly reminded me that I'm no longer a child anymore (her usual “subtle” threat of her being able to kick me out). Furthermore, she declared she'll never buy anything for me again.

I'm hurt and confused. I simply wanted to enjoy a common activity with friends, yet I ended up being berated and belittled. Feeling completely pathetic being hurt over something seemingly so unimportant. I don’t even know what I am supposed to do, I don’t have any money on my own and I cant’t even pay her pack now as she already bought them.

"Social services came round today to discuss housing. I tried to tell the social worker that me staying with family isn't an option. Social worker wasn't very happy about that 😅 so I tried to work with the social worker and tried to contact the only person I could think of to stay with. My cousin. She's always been there for me, always been supportive of me. Pretty sure my mum got to her like she did the rest of my family because she has blocked me. I have no family I can go to anymore. I'm 16 and homeless. I didn't think my mum would go this far but there ya go I guess? I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no options. I feel like I'm screwed. I knew social services getting involved again was gonna be bad and here we are. I just wanna cry"
"(Tw: Rant)

I have never had the best relationship with my dad. Growing up, he would beat me whenever I stepped out of line. For most of my life I would never get even a temporary escape from him as he was unemployed until I turned 16. So every day after school I'd have to stay with him. Some days he'd say he had meetings or job interviews and then just go cheat on my mom with some random on tinder. So as you can see, I don't really like him much. He's beat me less considering the fact that he had child protective services called on him by an old therapist I used to have for pulling my hair and slapping me around. Since then, he doesn't really hit me as hard as he used to or as frequently.

 Growing up, he'd force me to do fencing, a swordsman sport you probably see in the Olympics. I've never liked it much outside of doing it recreationally at my high school but as of last year he's forced me to take it more seriously and go to national competitions. Last year I went to an annual competition and did pretty terrible. My asthma kicked in and I felt like I was dying as soon as I got out there. My dad swore never to invest in me again as the expenses for that tournament were far more than we could afford but here we are again and in three days from now I’ll be competing in the same tournament in Ohio. I’m literally sick to my stomach. I begged him not to waste his money on this because I know I’ll do poorly but he didn’t listen he just yelled at me for not being positive. But how can you be positive when you lived in such a negative household your whole life?

I’m so scared to to be left alone with my dad Wednesday through Friday (competition time). Normally I’d text my boyfriend (that my dad doesn’t know about) to cheer me up but I don’t really want to tell him about my dad and our problems.

 I have a 3.6 GPA UW and my dad thinks if I preform well in this colleges will be more eager to accept me. But I know myself and I know my my limits and I know I won’t do well. I know a beating is waiting for me the day I get eliminated from the tournament. I’m so scared."
"balders gate 3 really highlighted this for me lol (I didn't buy it, it was gifted) 



Does anyone else feel the same way? We're dealing with near homeless atm and I'd rather chew my own foot of than to ask for any help. I just wish I had a parent that was helpful. Even just a little bit. "
"I am a girl living in India. A place where beating kids is seen as “appropriate “ and “discipline”. I have one of the most emotionally and physically abusive parents who are absolutely great at gaslighting you.

The thing about these parents are that they show even their basic duties as a gift. In fact, my dad says that beating me up is his right. My “parents” are these psychopathic people.

I once told my mom, (who is extremely judgemental btw) tht its ppl s choice to have sex before marriage and its ok whether they want or not. She got crazy and tried to touch and rape me to tell me how “dangerous” it is. Do uk when she tried to do it the first time? when i was 9. She was telling me how guys rape women and to make sure I understood she tried to “demonstrate” it. A mother is supposed to be a place of warmth and happiness but not for everyone in fact for some she causes horrors that leaves a lifetime impact. I hate my mom’s smell, looks, the way she talks and walks and everything, not because she is ugly or unattractive but because I detest the woman she is.

My dad is no better, he screams and yells at me and beats me up with a bat or a broom. He doesn’t have patience and is a pathetic cheater. What icks me off the most about him are not his beatings but his words. I can’t say those words for they have hurt me so much, so damn much. I hate how everyone thinks he is this “calm” and “intelligent” person when I am the only one who knows what he does and what a cheater he is.

My mom has a victim complex. Once there was this tuition teacher when I was 11 years old, she used to hit me a lot and always used to degrade me(I am not a dumb kid, I scored 96 percent in 10th recently). I guess because I already used to get beaten up at home, I couldn’t take any more of this. So I refused to go to that tuition and started crying. My mom dragged me out of the home to go to the tuition. Since I was just a 11 year old kid, I started crying. So my mom took me back to our house furious at me for crying in public. At home, she was so angry at me that she started yelling at me and telling me how she wanted me to die. All I could do was cry on the floor. But then she pounced on me and started pulling my hair so hard that I was sure I would die. I tried to push her off me because a grown 35 year old woman was trying to choke me to death. I swear that was the first time I saw death. My survival skills took over and I pushed her with all the strength a 11 yr old could muster but of course she was too heavy for me. So I pulled her hair back and when she loosened her grip a little, I escaped her hold. Then she called all her sisters,my cousins and my tuition teacher to tell them about how “I hit her and slapped her”. At 11, I was labelled as an abuser.  Then her sisters talked to me about how I was an abuser and that I should be handed over to police. I couldn’t understand what was going on and all I could do was cry. Suddenly the tuition teacher comes through our door, and I am sitting outside on our couch. She comes and slaps me hard on my face and I am shocked. Then she drags me to tuition where she makes me write a poem about how much I love my mother. At tuition, I was insulted and put forward as an example of what not to be in future. Then when I came back home, my dad said “if your parents are trying to kill you, its a blessing” and then I got beaten up by him.

So few days earlier, my mom was pulling this same thing and then she tore up my diary. I had been keeping this diary since I was sexually assaulted (another story) and tht diary had been my only consolation. Ever since that day, I am on edge and I hate myself."
hi I turned 18 last month and I graduated high school on the 20th of June how do I run away without too much drama happening and what do I need please this is dire
"from a young age everything was about them. their feelings. their hobbies. their passions. etc. this bled into my adolesence which basically caused me to have a lack of identity. everything was all about them. i had to defend myself against verbal ause, severe phsycial abuse everytime I tried to do something that prioritized myself. i was told that i was supposed to priortzie housework, cleaning, wathcing and babysistting my younger siblings before doing things for myself. when i refused i was beaten and called an evil selfish child. i was not allowed to do things for fun for myself i wasn't allowed because my mother and ather (despite making just under 200k a year) somehow 'couldn't afford' to pay for a baby sitter for us. so we had to be locked up in a closet for hours on end until my mother came home from work. no hobbies. no joy. no freedom. jsut depiration, neglect, beatings and constant verbal attacks. constantly being put down by my narc mother while my e-father sat there and watched while doing nothing (sometimes even joining in on the fun if he had energy). 

Didn't even let me go to bed at a decent time. nope. kept me up til 1 2 3 in the morning, beating me up. kept me up doing their fjpsidjijdc hosue chorsee constantly. cleaning the hosue in tip top shape eevery night jsut o be beaten up th enext morning for being tired. all i wanted to do was go to bed at a decent hour so I would have energy for school. but they would say i'm stuck up for wanting that. 

  
i hate them for what they did to me. how they continue to infantalize me yet put too much responsibility on me as a way to get me to do more work for them without asking for more. such horrible people. "
bro im so done w my dad hes been reallg horrible to me these past weeks like he fucking touched me he took my pants off and started touching me nd shit i js kept crying and couldn’t do shit he also has hit me more recently since ive been staying nights with him again kts js besn horrible 
"The fact that our parents abandoned and neglected my younger siblings and I to such an extent that we’re literally fighting to keep each other and ourselves alive as very young adults and teenagers is infuriating. 

Like literally fuck both of them. "
my dad did it in public in front of my friends. ffs 
"children are supposed to be loved. :( 
I've literally seen a mother threaten to slap her toddler in public by holding her so she couldn't move away and raising her hand as if she was going to hurt while nearly shouting at her    just because she was angry and couldn't control it as if they are supposed to be able to control how they act at that age."

"My parents seem to have a cycle of bullying me and threatening my safety, saying they will kick me out onto the street or saying they will take away all access to internet, and then trying to fawn over me and obsess over and coddle me. My dad will occassionally apologize and say that he overreacted, but within a few days they will find something else to shout at me about and say I am lazy and entitled and that they should kick me out because I am taking advantage of them. And the cycle repeats.

But every time, within hours of the event, they will act as if they never did anything. They will see me and smile and be offended if I don’t smile back. Every time I shut down around them, my dad says I am going into “autistic mode”. My mom plays the victim if I don’t want her to touch me and she says that she just wants connection. I tried to come out as queer with a new name to try and start over, but my mom gave me the silent treatment for days after. And then it’s like they forgot about that part of me and if I bring it up I am being unfair and threatening their emotional health.

When I ask why they won’t acknowledge my being queer, they either say it’s because their religion says it’s wrong, or mom says that my deadname is the name she gave me when I was born, and it is imortant to her (I am not allowed to change my middle name either). They say that both of them can’t think about me in any other way. If I talk about my mental health struggles at all, they say I obsess too much and I should just get a job and that I don’t work hard enough and have not suffered enough. I acknowledge everything would be better if I get a job, even though as much as I try I don’t even make interviews. My dad says that if I wanted a job I would have one by now.

I know they gaslight me. I know they are emotionally immature. I just don’t know how deep it goes in their perspective, and I don’t know if they are consciously aware of the pain they cause. That when I try to say I am suicidal, my mom gets triggered and she shouts at me (once said that my being suicidal makes her suicidal). She’s grabbed me and not let me get away. And she always seems to act before thinking, like if she’s emotional hurt she will remove all my access to family account connections like Amazon so I can’t use Amazon Prime shipping when needed.

I feel like I am insane because these parents give me top-tier iPads for Christmas and really expensive tech. But then they turn around and say they can take it away. I feel guilty for even thinking of how they treat me as abuse. My dad says my mom loves me so much and would do anything to protect me and feels so much pain for me. My dad has also said that if it was an ultimatum between me and my mom, he would always choose my mom. And then blames me if mom leaves late at night after an argument and says “we’re getting a divorce. This is what you wanted; are you happy?” (To be clear, I don’t want them to divorce. I don’t want to hurt them even by estranging myself from them.)

I don’t know how to reconcile any of this, the side of them that coddles me with the side that makes me afraid I will be homeless and without medication management support, that makes me feel so unsafe and struggling emotionally. I am 25 for reference, graduated from college as of December after almost seven years, but have a few disabilities that make it hard to even find work (I am using Vocational Rehab). So I am currently dependant on my parents. And suicidal depression makes it hard to even focus on getting a job when I am just trying to make sure I stay alive."
I thought my parents would change when I came out! As transgender! Female! At first they accepted but as I’ve been living here last few months particularly my dad’s behavior is getting worse! He’s been being extremely political lately which is part of the problem is he watches stuff on YouTube! I don’t agree with it! Apparently he sees me and my mom as slaves now we’re supposed to clean the house! And do everything he doesn’t want to do! He has kicked me out before for refusing to clean! I told my mom that if he did that I wouldn’t speak to ether of them again I would leave! He also said after I had decided to clean that he was going to raise my rent! Not to mention I currently feel fatigued and ill because I’m sort of sick! I’m at my literal breaking point rn! 
"For context he's been abusive my entire life, both physically and emotionally. On top of a *lot* of other sh-t in my current years. He's been also controlling my mom financially apparently and was really.. emotionally unstable. And now he's coming back soon after a couple of days, I'm not sure how to feel but my siblings seem excited to have him back soon. They don't know that he's abusive and think he's absolutely darling.. I don't want to tell my mom about this because she's stressed enough, a literal scar has been left from him leaving. He hurt her and I'm not sure I like the idea of him coming back, nor do I feel bad for him. But I don't think I can change it."
"So I've been coughing up white mucus and have been having shortness of breath and chest pain for the past two months

And today it got really bad, I couldn't breathe properly, I started feeling dizzy and faint. It took a lot of effort to keep myself straight, and I felt weak. I started crying because I thought I was dying. That this was my end. I seriously consitered jumping off my balcony so I wouldn't die of suffocation, that I could at least have a quick death.

My mom ignored me the whole time. She just kept taking her bath. She told me to go to bed, but I was afraid to go to sleep. I was very sure I wasn't going to wake up if I did. Eventually i started mumbling about how I was going to die, and I begged her to take me to the emergency room, I begge because i felt like I was going to fucking collapse. 

She started screaming at me, calling me a drama queen, saying I'm faking it and that I just want attenchion. That I was an attenchion-seeker. She grabbed me, shook me and eventually started hitting me. All while I contunied to beg to go to the damn doctor. 

She told me she hopes I die, that I'm such an attenchion-seeker and she was tired of me.


She kept hitting me everytime I coughed, but eventually she took me. She screamed the whole way about how she was a prisoner and that she can't have a life because of me.

 I'm 16, this is the only time she's taken me to one. I've had other issues, but she just yelled at me to shut up. And hit me untill I was to afraid to ask. That's why I never ask anymore, but I really couldn't breathe. It was either get hit and go or stay here and possible die

The entire appointment took 80 minuites.. she couldn't even take less then an hour and a half to take me to the doctor.

The emenergy room wasent sure what was wrong with me. My blood pressure was a little higher then it was supposed to be. And they kept suggesting asthma. 

They eventually just told me to go get an X-Ray, since they thought there might be something wrong with my lungs. They also have me some antibiotics and an inhaler. Well, they told my mom to go get them. And hasn't yet. I hope she does. I don't want to die next time I can't breathe. 

I have ADHD, so by law I'm required medicaid. She didn't have to pay for the appointment, it wasn't a money thing. She just didn't want to waste her time. 

I don't know, I'm tired of this all i think. 

She's always been like his, I kept getting ear infection as a younger child and it always took her months to take me, as I screamed in pain. 

She never took me to the dentist until I was 15 and finally called social services on her, and they made her take me. 

I think I might have some kind of PTSD or something since I'm constantly paranoid about my health. Since I know there's nothing I can do , worst comes to worse. 

I hope she gets my medication. I don't want to die."
"Please excuse any spelling errors I’m dyslexic 

I (16 ftm) believe my father (50 M) is watching me. 

Now I came here because 1: I’m not sure if this can be considered abuse. And 2: I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic.

Ever sense I was about 12-13 and it was known that I had started my period I’ve noticed that my father has perched himself outside of my door whenever he’s “suspicious”

If he comes into my room and notices that I’m laying in my bed doing absolutely anything at all, after he leaves I can clearly hear him outside my door standing there listening. 

If I turn on music on or move around he bursts in pretending to have forgotten something.
I caught him multiple times when I snuck over to my door and opened it as he was standing there listening, he would pretend that nothing was happening.

This has happened periodically sense I was young, once when I was 12 the same thing had happened but this time he made me keep my door open the rest of the day. Whenever I asked why nether him or my mother could make up any excuse and just said ‘because’

My family is vary religious, and that probably has something to do with his behavior but is it not weird that my father (only my father not not mother) would burst in at any chance at seeing something? He never has seen me doing absolutely anything and there’s no knock or warning. 

Am I being dramatic or is this weird??
Other odd things he’s done that seem unrelated are that when I was young 7-13yo he would slap my butt (in a teasing way but especially when I bent over). I always told him I didn’t like it but he continued until I was about 13 and stood my ground telling him to not do it anymore, he told me I was being dramatic but stoped.

Plus some other odd things. Again I don’t know if these are related or at all any concern, I get told by any family I tell that I’m being dramatic so maybe I am, what do you think?

"I don't think my parents were outright abusive, but I don't know where else to post this. Maybe they were neglectful in some aspects. I apologize in advance that is a very long post. I'm 16ftm, by the way.



My dad used to be an alcoholic, and would allow my siblings and I to watch really raunchy movies and the show BoJack Horseman when we were younger. I watched the 5th and 6th seasons of BoJack with my dad when they came out. I was 10. I also saw a lot of South Park when I was younger. One time my dad picked me up from a volleyball game told me he was ""fucking hammered."" My dad has made a lot of inappropriate sex jokes about my siblings and I. One time, he joked about my sister being a lesbian and having a large tongue. My dad asked me if I knew what masturbation was when I was in 7th grade. And he tells my family that it's funnier to add the words, ""in bed,"" to the end of fortune cookies, and I got a fortune cookie that said something like, ""It takes a long time to figure out what works,"" and my dad said that was true. My brother told me that olive oil was used as lube, because that's a mildly interesting history fact, and my dad overheard and said he tried it, and it didn't work very well. My parents have had sex in the same room as my siblings and I. It would happen in hotel rooms and the camper when we were camping, and my parents always thought we were all asleep, and I don't think my sisters have ever heard anything, but my brother and I have. Also, my parents' bedroom is right above mine, I don't want to be hearing them have sex. My dad has gotten extremely drunk and had some kind of breakdown. I'm not sure what to call it, but he yells at people. This has happened three times. The first time this happened was about 3 years ago. My family and I had just come from a basketball game, and we were trying to walk back to our car, but my dad kept walking off and talking about how he wanted to die. I cried, and my mom got mad at me for crying. When we got back to our car, my dad left again. My siblings and I went after him. We told him not kill himself, and a stranger told him that it gets better. My dad said thanks, and eventually we got back to the car and went home. The second time this happened was almost 2 years ago, on my sister's birthday. This is the only time this happened and my family was at home. My dad got drunk, and he started screaming at my mom about how he needed to find his phone, and how my mom needed to help him find it. She said no, and my dad took the van and drove off. I don't remember if this was before or after he left, but my dad told me to not cry and that it wasn't my problem. My dad crashed the side of the van into a tree, and now you can't open the right door of our van, because it has a really hard time closing. The third time this happened was about a year ago, and it was the most stressful. My family and I were going on a trip. We had to do a layover in Florida, and were going to spend the night there. My dad got drunk in the airport, and he called the hotel and kept asking for a shuttle. There was never a shuttle. My dad kept insisting there was a shuttle. The hotel was asking about the reservation, and asked for the code that was emailed to my dad. My dad started saying there wasn't a code, and I offered to take the phone and finish the call myself, but my dad said that would just make him angry. I started crying in the airport because he was being drunk and angry and I'm sensitive like that. My brother's girlfriend, who was with us, called over a taxi because she was fed up with my dad and we needed to get to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, it was a whole other situation. Apparently, we didn't have the money to pay for the hotel night. I'm fairly certain we did, and my dad just wasn't figuring it because he was extremely drunk. My dad started crying about going to jail because my dad was taking care of his dad and Adult Protective Services were charging him because he wasn't taking care of my grandpa well. My dad was yelling about how he was going back to America, and my sister told him that he was still in America, and my dad started yelling about something else. Then, my dad tried paying for our hotel rooms again, and started talking to the receptionist about how there wasn't a shuttle. I told my dad that it didn't matter at this point if there was a shuttle or not because we are at at the hotel now. My dad told me to, 'not fucking talk to him like that.' I started crying harder, and my mom was so fed up with it she paid for our hotel rooms herself, even though it was supposed to be a vacation paid by my dad. We had 3 rooms, one for me, my brother, and his then girlfriend, one for my sisters, and one for my parents. Anyway, we got the keys to our rooms. The receptionist was a very nice person who didn't speak a lot of English, and my brother and I apologized to him profusely. The receptionist gave my brother and I 2 free bottled waters, and told us to have a good night. I was still crying, and I told him to have a good night too. I actually think about him sometimes, because he was so patient with my dad even though my dad was being horrible. In the hotel room, my brother, his then girlfriend, and I were just trying to distract ourselves with the internet. No one could fall asleep. Eventually, my mom came into the hotel room, and thanked me for telling my dad he was being shitty. She told me she couldn't do it anymore and that she had to go tell him that she loved him and that he's not a bad person. I feel so bad for my mom because I know this has happened to her a lot more than it's happened to the rest of my family. In the morning, my dad said he was sorry ""from the bottom of his heart"" and one of my sisters said she forgave him. I didn't. That's not okay. Also, my dad got drunk in a hotel a few years ago and threw his phone on the floor so hard it broke because he got mad about Door Dash not working. My siblings and I still joke about that one, because that was really stupid. Any time my dad drinks now he gets physically sick, so he can't drink anymore.



My parents starting dating when my mom was 16 and my dad was 31. My dad was my mom's debate coach, and my mom became a high school dropout when she was 17 to go live with him, and they got married when my mom was 19. I didn't know how my parents met until I was about 12, and I only learned because my brother told me. I did think my parents' age gap was weird, though. I once made a joke about underage drinking in front of my mom, and she said she only underage drank when my dad gave her alcohol. I overheard my parents talking a few weeks ago, and it was interesting. My mom has been thinking about getting a divorce or going to marriage counseling for the last 6 months. My dad doesn't want to do either. My mom said she was in an inappropriate relationship with him when she was a child. I didn't hear what my dad said, but soon after he said he doesn't like the way my mom treats him. I was in the car with my dad a few weeks ago, and my dad told me how my mom has been talking to him more and more about their relationship, and my mom told my dad that she didn't think my dad is Catholic. No one in my family, except my mom, is religious. My dad has been lying to my mom their entire relationship about how he is Catholic. My dad actually got baptized as an adult, and told me about how ""fucking wasted"" he would get before those meetings. My dad told me that my mom wishes she had a good Catholic family, and how he never wanted anyone to go to church in the first place. I honestly wish my parents never started dating, because I believe they would both be happier if they never did.



My mom doesn't listen to anything anyone says. It's extremely infuriating. Recently, I had a big argument with her because our dryer was broken, and I asked her if she could call someone to get it fixed. She said no, and I asked why, but she just kept saying she wouldn't do it. I cried a lot about this because this was a problem that affected our entire family, and she wasn't doing anything about it. My brother fixed it, he's good with machines. A few years ago, I got into a really big argument with my mom because she kept putting bread in the freezer. I live in a family of 6. Putting bread in the freezer is doing nothing, and was only taking up freezer space. Apparently, I asked in a mean way or whatever because my mom said, ""I don't want to help you if you're freaking out."" I gave up trying to win that argument. I got into a lot of arguments with my mom when I was about 12 but I stopped trying to win them. I have learned that nothing I say to her will matter. I still have a poor relationship with my mom, but I don't care about fixing it. The rest of my family has similar issues with her. My dad's main issue with my mom is that they can't communicate and my mom not listening is part of that. My mom used to sign my siblings and I up for alter serving and mass readings without asking, and this would always bother us so much. About a year ago, my mom signed my sister for a mass reading and my sister was infuriated and called my mom a bitch. My sister ended up doing the reading, but my mom was really mad at my sister. Any time I get into an argument with my mom, one of my first thoughts is, 'I hate that goddamn woman.' This has happened multiple times, but I do not know if it is true. I can get along with my mom, but I would rather not talk to her. Everything she does bothers me in some way, which I think is unfair to her, and she is the only person in my life who I seriously dislike.



I started self harming at 12. The first time I ever cut myself, it was a few cuts, and I went into my living room to show my parents these ""weird cuts."" They didn't say anything or seem to care at all. I mainly self harmed on my legs for a few years. My brother got a girlfriend who self harmed, my brother was 16 and so was his girlfriend. When I was 14, my family was at my brother's girlfriend's house because our families were actually really close because our parents got along and all the kids were similar ages. Well, my brother's girlfriend cut her arm while we at their house. When we driving home, my mom told my siblings and I that if we ever wanted to hurt ourselves, we can always talk to her. I remember thinking, ""No. I've been doing this for 2 years, no."" When I was 15, my mom saw self harm cuts on my hands. She asked me if I ever did it anywhere else, and I lied and told her no. She told me that some people ""are into weird shit,"" and I just laughed awkwardly. I told her I wouldn't do it again. A few weeks later, one of my friends reported me to my school counselor for self harm. My counselor asked me if I wanted to tell my parents about my self harm, and I knew that it was required for them to tell my parents. I'm still mad at her for giving me an illusion of a choice even though I knew there was never one. So my parents told me they loved me and told me to not hurt myself again. I lied and said okay. My mom wanted me to go to therapy, so I went to a single online therapy session. I really, really did not want to go to therapy. I told my parents I didn't want to go to therapy again, and my dad defended me because he didn't want me to be ""put in a box."" My dad also has some weird beliefs about being medicated. My mom said that I didn't have to go to that therapist, but maybe I could try again in a few months. So, a few months later, about the same time I was I was supposed to go to another online therapy session, my parents saw more self harm cuts on my hands. My parents told me that when I'm hurting myself, I'm hurting them too. That's not helpful, assholes, don't make it about yourself. I said I was sorry but I refused the other therapy session. My dad kept defending me, and I didn't have to go.  Also, my mom told our extended family about my self harm, and never told me. I only know this because my grandma gave me a photo of Jesus holding someone like me and she told me it would help with my 'anxiety.' I hate that my mom told anything, I didn't even want her knowing. This was nearly 2 years ago. I accept now that I need therapy but I will not be asking for therapy while I am still living with my parents. I do not feel comfortable asking for it. I do not feel comfortable asking them for almost anything.



I'm trans and my parents don't do a great job of supporting me. I am fully socially transitioned, and have been out for over a year. All of my friends and people that I know (except extended family) use my correct name and pronouns. My dad uses my name in front of me, and I'm fairly certain he doesn't when talking to other people. My mom doesn't even try. She only thinks of me as her daughter, and nothing I do will ever change her mind. I came out to my parents twice, and both times it was over text. The first time it was really basic, and I told them my name and pronouns and I told them I loved them. The second time was a few weeks later, and I told them that I wanted them to start using my name and pronouns because I was hurt that they weren't trying. My dad said that he was using they/them for me, and my mom said we never got to talk about how I'm trans. I use he/him pronouns, and what is there to talk about? I'm trans. I'm your son. The end. I have a really hard time correcting people about anything, so I don't even try to correct my parents. It seriously hurts my feelings, but I'm not doing anything about it.



I have always had a really difficult time understanding math, even though I do fairly well in other subjects. One time in 3rd or 4th grade, my mom was 'helping' me with math homework, but all she did was call me stupid until I cried. My dad actually watched this happen and didn't say anything. When I was younger, around kindergarten age, my mom slapped me twice at different times. My dad asked me if my mom had ever hit me, and I told him no because I didn't want my parents to argue. Anytime the topic of child abuse is brought up, my mom asks my siblings and I if we are traumatized. My siblings and I never answer, but almost every time my parents are out of the house, my siblings and I talk about the annoying things our parents do. My dad has told me that his parents beat him, and I know he didn't have the greatest childhood. I know my mom had helicopter parents and grandma is still weird to be around. My grandma always thinks people are talking poorly about her and thinks everyone around her is ungrateful. She makes a lot of people in my family just straight up uncomfortable, especially my aunt. Also, my mom usually makes dinner, and always puts the food away after maybe 10 minutes. This has caused everyone in my family to eat really quickly, and any time I eat with other people I am always the first person to finish eating and it makes me so self conscious. My mom rushes everything. If something is brought to her attention, it needs to be taken care of immediately. If we need to go somewhere, she rushes everyone to the car as fast as possible and gets really passive aggressive really quickly. This is sometimes helpful, but most of the time it's just stressful. My parents do not listen to me when I talk about my interests. This hurts my feelings a lot because I really appreciate being listened to. I have very strong interests in certain topics, and I used to tell my parents about them all the time. I realized they do not listen to me when I was about 14, and this hurt my feelings very badly. It still does. When I was younger, my parents had this 'rule' that my siblings and I had to go to school unless we threw up. Like it didn't matter if we were sick unless we threw up. I believe they started this to deter my siblings and I from faking illness, but we weren't the kind of kids to do this in the first place. One time, in 5th grade, I really was sick. I don't remember all of my symptoms, but I had really bad headaches and was extremely exhausted for a week. But I never bothered telling my parents because I never threw up, and I knew they would make me go to school anyway. In 6th grade, I got sick. I really, really wanted to stay home. So I tried to force myself to throw up in order to stay home. I didn't have the puking kind of illness, but I was sick. My mom caught me trying to vomit, and got mad at me, but she let me stay home. I don't think she believed I was sick, but didn't care enough to force me to go to school. My parents thankfully haven't enforced this rule in over 4 years, and if I'm really adamant about not going to school, they don't make me. I don't overuse this, I skip about 3 days a school year. My parents argue a lot, by the way. It used to be a lot worse, but it's still not pleasant, but they haven't argued really badly in a few years because my dad seemingly gave up. Anyway, I prefer being around my dad than my mom by a lot. I do wish my parents were better. I wish I could tell them about my interests, and they would listen. I wish I could my parents that I had a hard day. I want them to be better, but I don't think I am ever getting that.



When I was 9-11 years old, and my brother was 11-13, he sexually abused me. I still feel really weird saying that, because I don't think it was actually that bad, but I do not know what else to call it. I'm not going into detail of what my brother did for this post, but rather what my parents did. Because the answer is nothing. My brother and I slept in the same basement, in the same bed for 2 years. I have no idea how our parents didn't think anything could be wrong. One time when I was 10, my brother took pictures of me shirtless. Well, my mom found them, and confronted me about it. I clearly did not take the pictures, and she was mad at me. She told me about how someone could use the photos for child porn, and she deleted the pictures, but I seriously have no idea how she didn't think about how I did not take them myself. During the last year of this, my brother and I slept in the attic together. Again, I have no idea how my parents never thought anything was wrong, but mostly I'm mad at my mom for not thinking anything was wrong when she found the pictures of me shirtless. 



Thank you very much for reading, I really do appreciate it. I just want to know if my parents could have been better. I don't think they ever wanted to be bad parents, but maybe they could have been there more for my siblings and I."
"Please help me is she abusive ? 

Anyone have an idea of what is wrong with my mum 
I’m aware smth is wrong with me but she’s a problem 

She’s always been bad but got worse after her dad died two and a half years ago 

And I’m not nice either but we gloss over that for now cause I am working on it 

For starters she can’t ever admit she’s wrong 
I think in 17 years I’ve heard her apologise to me once after slapping me on the face and scratching it (which she still tried to say she only meant to slap me not scratch me ) she then asked me to lie to people about what happened 

She has called me all sorts and can’t ever say sorry 
Today i said pretty awful things in an argument she started (which she denies ) and she said pretty awful things (like calling me a pig) but doesn’t see she was in the wrong 

2- she lies all the time and twists my words against me 
I said I wanted a mother who cared about me because I don’t feel she does when she treats me like this . She said that I had said she should have never adopted me. She often tries to gaslight me into thinking she didn’t say things to the point where I wonder if I’m imaging things but I don’t have this problem at school so I don’t think so (I have a lot of friends ) 

3- she refuses to get a thearipst I’ve literally begged her so she can learn to be nice 
She barely has any friends 
She blows up over small things and then blames me 

She has hit me many a time and I have to her 
My dad hits me too and vise versa

"I (16f) live with my family. I grew up with an emotionally abusive/neglective mom and a physically abusive little sister. Sometimes my mom would join in on the physical abuse but it was never anything serious until a year ago. I have past trauma of being sexually assaulted by my ex step dad 4 years ago and my mom keeps putting off therapy. About a year ago my mom started spanking me out of the blue. It wasn’t as punishment or anything, she just did it. I would be minding my own business and she would come up behind me and smack my butt. I’ve expressed how much this made me uncomfortable multiple times but she would pull the victim card and accuse me of calling her a pervert and how I hurt her feelings. She kept doing it and I had to bare with it. I was ok with dealing with it in silence until recently. About a week ago my mom smacked my butt again but this time I told her straight up that it makes me uncomfortable and I don’t appreciate her touching me like that. She just ignored me and complained about me to my now step dad. I thought she would stop after that but the VERY NEXT DAY she did it again. She never stops no matter how many times I’ve asked her to stop. She knows about how I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times starting back when I was 4 but she won’t stop. I don’t have the money to move out and I have no friends/family to stay with. What should I do? Any advice? "
"I have no control over it. My mom wants to give him away because she isnt patient enough for him to grow up a little and learn to behave better with the help of a behaviorist. Now someone else will love my sweet, sweet pup the way that I did. I can never get him back. They'll play all his favourite games with him. They'll get to pet him. They will take him on walks and take him around. He will get all the love he deserves, but I wont be the one doing it. I might see him in another house, in someone else's lap, getting all their love. And I will never get to do it again. He will have a new name, new house, new favorite humans- and he will forget about me. People who dont know the truth will judge me and hold me equally responsible for giving him away, they'll shun me, while I sit by myself, helpless, missing such a big part of my life that I can never have back. "
"Hi, I'm a teenage girl and I have two older brothers and a single mom. Ever since I was little guys have come in and out of the house. Usually they are weird or sketchy, as in the do drugs, alcohol, criminal past, etc. This is due to my moms rough childhood past and her broken boy slection. She also has a rathelarge savior complex. She is also a crazy minopulator, so when the guys realize it they tend to get the he'll out, I don't blame them 

So basically my mom's new bf moved in with his little 6 year old. The 6 year old does have some behavior issues ex:lies, repeatedly asks for things, spoiled, annoying, screams a lot, but personally I don't consider them to be that bad. She has gone through her own personall trauma. However my mom (since she is licensed to work with kids) thinks she can fix her. She has been doing all sorts of disciplines which I believe have now gone too far 

Ex
Feeding her spicy Strachan when she misbehaves
Making her repeat 100 tomes that she's not in control
Spanking her multiple times rather hard
Making her weardiapers because she peed in the bed
Making her cut apart her own stuffed animals 
Making her do lots of exercises upstairs naked
Screaming and yelling at her

Would you consider this abuse? I personally am starting to, and I havenever seen my mom like this. I think she is taking her frustrations out on the girl. What should I do? My mom is a manipulator and at this point the bf is thinking of moving out."
"(I'm not gonna throw my whole story about my mom but to sum it up: Was going through the worst time of my life (I was 12) and became super depressed, ended up almost dying intentionally and she told me I was being dramatic when I revealed I tried, then babies my brothers, acts sexist, racist, homophobic, and always belittles and berates me, constantly says things and lies and manipulates. My worst example yet was I asked if my brother was okay when he was being taken to the hospital and they said yes, so I didn't worry and continued on with the week, only today to hear my mom telling everybody he almost died later, which freaked me out. I went to bed that night crying on the spot in the couch he was laying in, alone. Since I was alone those entire 2 days.)

So... little rant here. My mom can be nice, and gives great advice, but she also can be terrible. Like when I was 12 and she told me that everything happening to me was my fault and I'm too blame, to her getting mad at me for standing up for myself. And more recently, her looking at me and telling me ""looks like you need to get your but on the Peloton"". She's made me hate myself countless times, and is the main reason I can barely eat dairy, gluten, and sugar anymore, because she ignored me when I would cry in pain and tell her everyday I was hurting, until the point I almost had a stomach ulcer. It took me 8 whole years to convince my mom I wasn't faking being in pain, and now I'm finally better, however my stomach got heavily damaged and now I can't eat any of that really... Another great example was I was laying on the couch in pain and she came back home from going shopping and started yelling at me, causing me of just wanting to hang out in my iPad while I was laying there crying in pain. I didn't know why until she said ""oh it's cause you ate yogurt"" and I was confused, then she said ""oh yeah you're lactose intolerant""... I THINK YOURE SUPPOSED TO TELL YOUR KIDS WHAT THE ALLERGY AND INTOLHERENCE TESTING SAYS. Also she was the one who made it for me, knowing full well it would make me be in pain!

I have a great example here, I get hot flashes often since I'm going through puberty, and my mom got mad at me for wanting to wear (LOOSE) shorts in 7 Celsius. Keep in mind, I'M BORN AND RAISED IN CANADA. She told me to go put leggings on and I calmly explained that they were too hot and told her I checked the weather and everything, I also had a sweater because my legs were just really hot (in both ways, jk). She then started screaming at me, and told me if I wore shorts in this weather I would look like a ""freak and an attention whore"". Funniest part is. MY DAD WAS RIGHT BESIDE ME, WEARING A T-SHIRT AND SHORTS. I was more dressed than him! And my brother was wearing shorts too, shorter than mine! She also constantly tells me I need to start working out more and will squeeze my legs or my but as she says that, great, I'm going into highschool I don't need to be more self conscious. (And I am not overweight by any means, but then again I also don't know my weight since I'm not allowed to know, that's just what doctors have said in medical examinations).

Another thing that's pissing me off is my brother recently went to the hospital, which of course I feel terrible because he could've literally died, luckily it's just a condition (not serious or anything), no organ or brain damage so he's okay, he'll be back to normal in a couple of days. But because of this huge development my parents cancelled my entire birthday (which is 3 weeks away), which this is the one year I actually got one. See, every year for my birthday my mom would ask people to bring cans of food and then she'd donate it all, which is awesome! I love that, but as a 7 year old who really wanted a scooter, it sucked. And I wasn't allowed to have friend birthdays either, just family. I'm not mad about gifts or anything, I actually specifically told my entire family to not get me anything for my birthday because I don't like getting gifts, my ""birthday day"" was going to be my family actually spending the day with me. That's all I wanted. 

She also acts like I'm lesser in many ways, I'll voice a concern, such as me almost passing out and throwing up after using a tampon, and she'll tell me I'm being over dramatic. But the second she sees my brother even slightly sad, she legitimately went ""HES DEPRESSED""... I WAS LAYING IN BED STARING AT THE WALL WITH TEAR RUNNING DOWN MY FACE FOR WEEKS ON END AND YOU DID NOTHING. NOTHING. DON'T FUCKING TELL ME I DONT KNOW WHAT SUICIDAL DEPRESSION IS. 

Not to mention her obviously being sexist, and being okay with my great uncle gropping my butt (he is mentally challenged, I understand that, but she still makes me hug him whenever I see him which is alright I guess, just uncomfortable because he's very touchy...) 

She also gives me these rules: Work out 3 times a week, do all the laundrey, do all the dishes (I mean for EVERYONE for both those things), hang out with friends once a week, get A's in everything, 2 hours of homework every night, no wearing pajama's outside of your room, not allowed to mix two baggy clothes together, at least the pants or the shirt has to be tight, no spending any of your money (All of it goes into savings), and also maximum amount of gluten a day: 2 slices of bread, maximum amount of dairy: 1 fudgecicle, maximum amount of sugar: 1 popsicle, RARELY a couple chips. Also no soda at all, since it causes cancer, and not much meat, since it also causes cancer, and also nothing not natural, because it all causes cancer...

She also yells at me a lot, like she once yelled at me because I couldn't find her shoes and stayed screaming at me in anger, and I will ask her something like ""hey, can you help me with a projec-"" ""NO IM ALREADY STRESSED ENOUGH."" UGHHHH- ITS SO ANNOYING SOMETIMES. She rarely lets me finish sentences and tells me ""don't be negative"" when I tell her about this girl I don't like at school. I'll also tell her ""hey don't tell anyone this"", like some really private stuff, we're talking like stuff about my body too, and she'll go and tell everyone and then say ""I didn't know I'm sorry!""... AHHHHHH-

Sometimes I don't know what to think, she critiques me in every way possibly, I bring home a report card of all A+'s and she says ""good job"" and that's it, she hasn't even let me seen my own report card, she gets mad at me for not working out for 2 days straight and for eating junk food (a popsicle), and tbh I would go outside... but I don't have anyone to go with. I don't like the kids in my class, I've made that very clear, yet my mom continues to get mad at me for not being more social. I linked up today ""How To Get Outside More"" because I am trying to cut down my screen time, and all I saw was family activities... I didn't realize spending a whole day with your family in summer was normal. Like just, waking up, and going to the beach or something, or grabbing ice cream and talking, I didn't know that was normal. And now I'm starting to question everything..."
"Long Story Short, I Need Help. My Mother Has Been Emotionally And Vocally Abusive For A Large Portion Of My Life. I Think I Was Barely A Preteen When It Started, But My Memories Of The Early Incidents Are Hazy And I Don't Remember Exactly When She Began Targeting Me. I Know I Grew Up With Her Berating And Belittling Dad Whenever He Misunderstood Something Or Got Something Wrong, Or Sometimes For No Reason At All. She'd Scream At Him And Cuss Despite Her Children Being Right There.

She Still Does That, The Only Difference Is She Takes Her Frustrations Out On Me Too. She Especially Loves Targeting My Insecurities And My Health Conditions, Both Physical And Mental. She Accuses Me Of Faking My Tics For Attention, She Calls Me 'Lazy' And 'Ungrateful' Because My Depression And Arrhythmia Make Moving Around The House A Chore. She's Mocked My Sensory Issues On Facebook In Front Of Everyone And Called Me A 'Crybaby' Because I Hated The Texture Of Some Clothes She Bought Me. More Than Once, She Has Compared My Issues To Her Own R@pe Trauma, Saying I Should Be Grateful I Don't Have It As Bad. Gaslighting, Traumadumping, You Name It.

Now She's Even Tried To Throw Me Out Of The House Because I 'Refuse' To Get A Job Even Though My Unmedicated Depression, Anxiety, And Arrhythmia Make That Nearly Impossible. With The Arrhythmia Alone, I Often Have To Sit Down To Bathe Myself In The Shower Or Wash The Dishes Because My Heartbeat Skyrockets And I Might Pass Out Otherwise. I'm 24 Now And I Can't Call Child Protective Services Or Anyone To Help Me Escape, However I've Called Both The APS And The Police With Little Result. My Panic Attacks Have Gotten So Much More Frequent And I'm Constantly On Edge, Just Waiting For The Other Shoe To Drop And For Her To Blow Up On Me Again. I Can Barely Even Eat Anymore Because She's Always Around, I've Had Maybe Two Whole Bananas Split Across Three Unfinished Ones In Over A Week. Now My Heart Is Really Starting To Fight Back. My Boyfriend Has Recently Started A Fundraiser To Help Me Out Of My Situation If Anyone Is Willing To Spend Any Money Or Just Share The News. I Can PM The Link."
"(F 15) I was in the heat of a panic attack and I was asking my mom for reassurance that I’m okay and she starts screaming at me and almost hit me like 2 times and I asked her to stop yelling she said “how else am I supposed to make you listen this is how you make kids listen back in my day.” When I was crying and shaking and she knows I don’t go good with people yelling around me because of my dad and she said “how do you think I feel having to put up with your shit like this all the time” I can’t call anyone (like police wise) since if she goes to jail I’ll be stuck with dad and he’s not safe to be around due to addiction and if he gets arrested I’ll be basically homeless idk what to do this isn’t the first time something like this has happened this happens on an almost daily basis but I need others opinion on what this seems like because no one is listening to me irl.

"for context I'm 24, my little sister is 20, I haven't been in contact with my dad/stepmom for a little over 3 years, my sister texted me asking for help with computer questions and what started all of what's below this is me not replying to the questions they were making my sister ask me ...



My abusive/manipulative step-mom made a new phone number to text me again after a whole 3 years of not being in contact with them because of everything they've done to me, between abusing me, pointing knives at my neck, gaslighting me, manipulating me, etc ... they will not leave me alone and now I apparently cant talk to my own little sister when she asks me for help.

they have done everything under the sun to try and manipulate me or get my money which is not obviously not working, they've essentially conditioned my poor little sister into not even being able to function and I mean to the point where she's scared of using a microwave to heat up food (i wish I was joking)

they invited jerk into their house who was a previous abuser of mine and they treated jerk like a good family friend despite knowing what he's done to me (beating me, abusing me mentally/physically, implying several different ways to my mom that she should take her life, abusing my mom, not letting us go to the doctor when needed, etc)

I called my mom immediately after because these horrible people (my dad, stepmom and abusive ex stepdad) stress me out to the point where I pace back and forth and don't even realize it... I love my little sister but taking my ability to talk to her away is horrible, I'm stressed out and very anxious on top of that I'm going through a major depression episode currently and I don't know what to do or how to prevent them from not letting me talk to my sister, I'm worried they're going to make her block me and delete my number, I'm not in the same state as my sister either. I'm sorry that this is all over the place I just cant really focus right now."
"I’m just recently, at 29, coming to terms with the fact that my mom was abusive. She hasn’t really done most of it since a few years ago now for some reason, idk why. She still love bombs and makes me feel really guilty for not wanting to be around her. She has always love bombed but was also abusive and filled with hate. Maybe I’m just not remembering but as the middle kid, I don’t think she was like that with either of my brothers. I’m still the one most messed up in the head but I don’t know if she abused me because of that or if I’m like this because of the abuse. Was anyone else here the only one of your siblings that you remember or are being abused? If so, do you have any thoughts on it or anything? Thanks.

"At least five different people have seen her and concluded the mother has extreme envy but when questioned she even becomes violent and contemptuous towards the child mocking it showing malicious envy. When the child has something she wants she tries to get it for herself first and when the child does better than her she tries to destroy her to a level where she doesn't look as bad. She involves herself gratuitously with the child who she has betrayed in an issue with the father who therefore wants to cut off contact with her, but always to try to slander, mock and try to cut the child down and determine what she can and can't do. She refuses to see the child as an adult and when asked to either support her child or eff off she says she never wanted to be a mother. 

She then tries to misgender her child or say horrific things about her passing opinions she has no right to pass anymore given she economically abused the child out of the claim she didn't ever want to be a mother. Just sheer hate oozing off of her. 

Essentially she is raiding the daughter's life for parts as her mother, while trying to claim she never wanted to be a mother. Extreme malicious envy to the point of violence apparent.

What would you do? I've never seen someone this bad. It's really hard to be the child of someone like this who people actively can see is in malicious envy then denies it then denies ever wanting to be a mother while passing opinions when she shouldn't be involved but then claiming the mother card when she gets caught in involvement."
I’m a junior in college and haven’t been financially dependent on my step mom and dad for years and currently working 2 hours away in the middle of nowhere with barley no service which they know and two week prior was yelled at cause by my stepmom who said me and my girlfriend who have been traveling for 24hours btw said we had bed bugs which we didn’t ( my girlfriends dad is a pest technician) she was yelling at me and called me almost every name in the book and me and my girlfriend left my stepmom and Dads place immediately and haven’t been there for the past two weeks and not once have they reached out to apologize or anything but bills I have to  pay for stuff college and yesterday I was blow away by these texts she sent calling me butt hurt and that I need to get over myself I’m just exhausted of them and really don’t know what to say or what to do anymore this has been going on my whole life but now that I’m an adult I want to decide what relationship I want to have with my family?! 
"I’m 20 now still living with my mom, This is hard for me to write as I always suppress everything my mom has done to me and move it to the back of my head to the point I forget it. But today marks the final straw and I want to share my story. My mom has been mean to me for awhile now. She always yells at me for forgetting things when I have adhd and I have a memory problem. She tells me I have to have a gf that she accepts and the girl I’m with right now she doesn’t like just because she has tattoos and piercings but I love her to death. She acts 2 faced with people, says “ thank you honey” to her friends but when she’s alone with me she’s sometimes nice but she gets so mad easily. She blames me for her working so much, and she also has my bank account information and she sees my finances and also takes money out. I ask her why did you take money out? She says I needed it for bills don’t be penny nickel and dime with me I’m your mother.
She also tells me I have no controll in this house and no rights, she also tells me I am so close of getting kicked out. None of my family takes my side when I tell what she does because I thought it was a normal things mothers did. But she’s gotten worse. I’m 20 and I now have a cerfew, she hates that she now wants my location. She takes shit about me behind my back to her fucking 
Co workers she blamed me for going to another state for extra money and just todsy she got mad over me sleeping in. I don’t know still is this normal?

"My partner broke up with me a month ago in a severe mental health crisis. He’s currently hot and cold and caught between wanting me back and feeling scared of how he treated me during the break-up (he was verbally and emotionally abusive, that’s not typical).

I kind of knew throughout our relationship but have been really putting the pieces together that a lot of our issues have come down to his family accepting him back. Not just for me, but for the mental state he’s been in.

His family is generationally poor but ran into extreme wealth right before he was born. His entire life was planned for him before he was born but he turned out to be disabled and gay. He had a super tumultuous upbringing, was kicked out and spent his teen years homeless & in active addiction with his family turning a blind eye.

I have some family with money and their dynamic reminds me a lot of mine, it’s a very “we’ll give you reward money if you’re doing well but if you don’t meet expectations we’re not gonna help you, you have to help yourself” type of system.

A year ago, my boyfriend was given a check from his grandparents for the first time since he was 13. Shortly after he found out he has an inheritance. I started to notice a shift after this. He started denying his parents’ abuse and being self-critical in really intense ways that reflected his upbringing. This was obviously concerning me but I have been down that road before with my family being nicer to me and I know it’s just so hard when you just want family. I was really expecting this shift to kind of run its course.

When he’d go home without me almost every time he’d call me having a panic attack unsure of why. I’m honestly questioning now why I didn’t try to find a kind way of saying it, I was worried he’d get upset or start to break down. He wasn’t in therapy until very recently (was trying to get him in for 6 months before he made that step). I just know how jarring and unnerving it is to remember how bad things were and I didn’t want to push that work or let him go through it unsupported outside of the person telling him. He’d come back from these visits totally shaken up but denying it.

But something I didn’t quite realize the full extent to until recently is how much the ways he treated me were influenced by his family dynamics. He started to be ableist toward me (we’re both disabled), obsessive around money, I’m pretty sure he was playing a money game with me that I wasn’t aware of (in that I think he was expecting me to “hold up ends” on certain things without telling me because I make less than him). His behavior and treatment of me started to feel really off like I was missing something around the start of this year and honestly the only time I’ve seen something like this was from people with money having “expectations” they don’t tell you about.

And this is super opposite to who he is. He’s an anarchist, he’s struggled more with physical disability than I have, being bed-bound for long stretches of time and having to use mobility aids at certain points. At the start of our relationship, he lent me some money he told me he was more than comfortable giving me because I was struggling to pay rent. He actually insisted. He has continually upheld that he’s more than happy to. Through this break up, he’s told me if I’m ever struggling financially to let him know. But, sometimes when he’s mad he says things that are just a little bit off, feel like a little resentment.

And I’ve kept my concerns about family and the impact on him mostly to myself. If he ever outright denies his past I say “hold on, xyz happened.” And he kind of shrugs it off. He started calling his mom a lot before he broke up with me and both times he broke up with me, most of what he talked about was his career and financial success. I asked him one time to question if a specific thing his mom said aligned with what he wanted and he screamed “don’t talk about my mom like that.”

It’s just so tough. I’m the only person who’s seen this development and it’s getting to a really concerning point. His family’s inclusion of him again is supporting all of his biggest fears around financial insecurity tied to his homelessness trauma but it’s all conditional love. I think he feels afraid that he won’t be successful enough to be good in the eyes of his family. The shitty thing is my dad went down this road to an extreme and I know that even when you do everything you can, you’re just never enough. He’s pushing himself way past the point of burnout in terms of work and career success and he cut me off instead of the work. After telling me he was planning the opposite. But then he called his mom again.

I’m really scared for the day he realizes that he chose conditional love tied up in money by people who abused him over unconditional support and love from someone who holds him while he screams and cries, who encourages him to tell himself that he’s enough and to do self-work for himself and him alone, until he believes it.

He always tells me I give the best advice, that I’m the kindest and most patient person to him. He has other wonderful supports in his life that he doesn’t use. His mom gives advice that’s super questionable sometimes, all about success and sometimes she just says the meanest off-handed remarks when he’s trying so hard.

But even though I tried to stay out of the game and let it play itself out, it became me vs. them. And I’m worried. This isn’t about our relationship anymore it’s about the slippery slope for him, and the way he’s been treating himself.

I wrote some pages about my dad’s experience of embracing abusive family with money that honestly has so many parallels to him, just went way too far unnoticed for way too long. I can’t think of another way to express concern, I worry about talking to him directly with how it’s gone in small moments before, but I also question if I should express concern at all. I don’t want the whiplash of not trusting anyone, not right now. But his family are not good for him in this way. You can keep family but you have to keep them at a distance when they’ve hurt you like this. You have to question their advice. I had to. 

He does still trust me but there’s some broken trust, it’s hard to tell where he’s at, he started to have false memories about me and believe I was manipulating him (I honestly weirdly think it’s because I was always honest with him, he’s used to people lying).

We’re low contact until he stabilizes enough to hold a conversation with me, his extreme mental health episode is swinging the other way. He’s undiagnosed rn but the swinging has me having some ideas of what might be going on.

Do you wish someone had told you? Did someone tell you? How did they tell you? What do I do?"
"I have come to Reddit for the communities opinion. I am 15, and so is my now ex girlfriend. We met online, and she thought I was cute so we started dating. Through are relationship that lasted around few months, she had opened up to me about a few deep things. I feel bad sharing it, but I won’t say anything about her so her identity is still covered. Anyways, she had started telling me about her life. She has been raped multiple times, her mom was arrested because a bad boyfriend got her into drugs, etc. She opened up to me about one topic that truly stuck out and broke my heart, but now I’m wondering who is telling the truth. 

So my ex. She had told me about MANY occasions of her being abused. I have about 135 screenshots of messages from her telling me about the living hell her dad and stepmom have been putting her through. When she was 11, her dad threw her off her bed and threw her into a Barbie Dream House, and many occasions of her dad hitting her. Then her stepmom made it even worse. She told me that it started when the stepmoms younger son wouldn’t give my ex her stuff back, he grabbed her stuff, I believe makeup or her phone, and wouldn’t give it back, so she took it from him. She said she wasn’t aggressive, not like she threw him to the floor to get the item, but her stepmoms reaction was a 11 because of a situation that was max a 3. So she said after her stepmom saw her, then tackled her to the ground. My ex said she tried defending herself by throwing a metal cup at her, but it didn’t work. She said after her stepmom tackled her onto the tile floor, she started yanking her head back and forth, smashing her head against the floor. She said her stepmom was on top of her, and she was loosing chunks of hair because how she was pulling. She ended up with a concussion, went to the hospital, told the nurse, and since her stepmom acted nice, they didn’t believe her. When she told me that I was literally on the verge of suicide, and homicide because I was so upset. 

Anyways, please, tell me what I should do to help. I tried telling CPS multiple times, and do even got an adult to call and I called back later and told them who called and they just did nothing, my ex said she tried the police to, etc. I also believe it because someone from her school who she never talks to said she noticed some bruises, and when she got the concussion, she told everyone her and her friends had just been playing rough. 

Edit: It was all lies. She was a total liar 😐"
"im 15F and i really need help and im so fucking lost. 

I have abusive parents, extremely esmily abusive parents. So i contacted a child helpline who got into contact with my school and they contacted social services. They told me they had to contact the police cus of the severity of the situation. but theyre making jt worse. They want to contact my parents and have a meeting and make them sign some papers.

 Im so fucking worried about my safety and contemplating calling the police. Please help me decide what i should do n if i call the police what do i say? "
I stopped going to my dad's a few months ago because my step mom hit me one night Claiming I Threatened my brother now I live with my mom and sometimes see my dad and two younger siblings when we go to eat at a restaurant or something that are 5 and 3 I want to stay in there life's but how
I have a little brother that’s much younger than me and still living with my narc father. My father is emotionally and physically abusive to my mother. I grew up with a messed up perception of relationships. I would endure so much abuse. Since my brother is a male I’m worried he will grow up to be an abuser.
"I was verbally and physically abused by my dad from ages 5-10. My parents divorced when I was in 5th grade and he moved out that’s when it stopped. I am now 14 and he has entered a relationship with a new woman who has 2 younger kids 4 & 5. 

I can’t tell if I’m projecting my past experiences with him but the way he talks to the kids makes me anxious and uneasy. I don’t know if it’s just in my head or not but whenever he talks to them I hear an aggressive and impatient tone like the one he used to speak to me in. 

Has anybody else had the same feeling and am I valid for feeling like this?"
"It was a long time ago, probably back during the late 2000's-early 2010's when my father used to inflict physical abuse upon me. He eventually changed, however his behavior hasn't. He now inflicts verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse onto me. He calls me names, he yells at me, he yells swear words at me, he makes fun of my interests and ruins my day etc. And whenever I talk to him, it seems like he plays the victim and compares how his parents used to beat him despite the fact that he was born in the 80's and I was born in 2008. It's also not just towards me, but also to my sister and stepbrother. And he also does this when his wife (my stepmom) or any other adult is gone, and talks smack about them behind his back. I can't take this anymore, I don't want to be with him. What should I do? Especially since he often gaslights me into trusting him and how his wife and mother defend him. "
"I apologize if I seem a little scattered right now. This all happened today. For some background, I, (f 33) have been living on my own with my husband for about 5 months. Unfortunately, we moved to an apartment and I could only take two of my 3 cats. I opted to keep my oldest cat, Cinnamon, 16 ginger cat where he was the most familiar. He was very frail and wouldn't have tolerated being moved safely. 

Well, my mom asked me to come over to help take care of some paperwork. After she asks me, she goes basically oh yeah, Cinnamon has been missing for a few days and I haven't seen him. I went over today to look for him, and confirmed that she had not seen him in at least 2 days. We got into an argument over this, which I recorded. I will post the link here. 

TW heavy language, direct mention and innuendo of abuse. 

https://youtu.be/PmeIU7ryhj8?si=qpjDg_iKyxXbXC2w

After this argument, I searched to no avail and decided to get something to drink and eat at home, and for a chance to gather my feelings. I went and looked a total of three times. Each time confronting my mother about where my cat was, as well as the bubbling forces bottled up of all of the abuse I've experienced. 

Then, the third time I went over, I noticed what looked like a decomp stain on the carpet, in the exact shape of a cat, positioned in a 3/4th loaf, as a cat does, with its head touching the ground. The stain alone wasn't enough for me to confirm exactly. Something told me to check outside. I slowly waded through tall grass and jaggers on the property, as it's on an acre. There, I found a fresh, square shaped grave that appeared to have sunken since the ground was damp. My mother lied to me the whole time, and my cat was unfortunately already deceased.

"Not bothering with a throwaway because none of my family really use Reddit, and if they do I doubt they're in this sub.

My (M, 22) father (M, 68) is abusive as all hell. He hasn't been physically abusive since about two years ago (though the brunt of it was before I was 16), when he became too crippled to do much of anything. Now he sits on the couch all day listening to political youtubers loud enough for me to hear with headphones on from my room across the house.

Here's a list of stuff that he did in the span of 3 months.

* Emptied the bathroom trash can all over the floor because no one had taken it out yet during cleaning day.
* Cussed out my older sister (F, 24) when she called him out on that (He's always professed to be a Christian who hates strong language like that, this was the first time he had ever said ""fuck you"" to anyone in the house).
* Attempted to get me to physically fight him when I called him out on acting like a child, and then laughed when I told him he wasn't worth it.
* Told my sister that he wants everyone who supports trans people to go to Hell (this includes all 3 of his kids that still live with him, and he later tried to step back saying he didn't mean us).
* Mocked me when I tried to calmly give him Bible verses that preached against hate.
* Forced my mom (F, 43) to cut contact off with her cousin because he thinks she'll cheat on him with the guy (This is gonna get more context in the body of the post, because there is more information on this).
* Called my mother a whore after finding out she sold herself to make sure we could eat when we were toddlers, trying to gaslight her into thinking that he didn't refuse to deal with any family finances during that time.

Previously he's also ran off basically every one of his kids from his first marriage except for like, 2, including the one that I was actually close to.

I will give that his distrust of mom with her cousin does not come from out of nowhere. They were sexting (I know. It's disgusting. None of us approve), and he found out about a year and a half ago. However, he didn't ban her from talking to him then. He didn't do that until two weeks ago, after he had driven my sister out of the house because of how bad his behavior was, specifically because he said that he thought she was planning on leaving him too.

He has consistently reprimanded my mom for unfaithfulness, but all three of us were born while he was still married to his first wife, and this entire relationship only started because of an affair. He blames her for how long it took to get divorced when he was the one working at the time.

I want to get out of this house, but I'm only a substitute teacher right now, and there's very few career options at the moment. We only have one working car (two are broken down and one can only really go around town), so getting a job outside of town isn't possible yet. Additionally, I live in Florida, where housing is insanely expensive even above national averages because of how many people come down here to retire.

As stated earlier, my sister tried leaving, but she had no money saved up and got fired from the first job she got because her car wasn't clean (she got a job as a pizza delivery driver), and will likely need to come back here. I don't want to repeat the same mistake and leave when I have no money.

I don't have many IRL friends, and none of them live in this town except for my brother in law, who lives with us, so I don't have an out for now. Any ideas for how to get out of here? I'd need to basically leave the state in order to have a chance of affording a place."
"I can't do it anymore. My father wasn't even sober week ago, on my last day of school. My friend's parents were and I was do jelous."
"My mother has kicked me out twice before at 16 and 17 years old. She is about to do it again. I am 18 now and have 3 months until I move out for university.  

My mother has been mentally, emotionally and verbally abusive to me all my life. It used to be physical until one day at school as a kid, I told my homeroom teacher I didn't want to go home and explained why. The school kept me there until the police sorted out the issues with my mum and she has rarely touched me since. However, this has led to her getting worse in other ways.

My mother is disabled, I look after her and her many conditions have made her worsen each day; so it's thought in theory that I'm just her punching bag when other things in her life don't go well. She is verbally abusive to me everyday, I take notes of the things she says and does sometimes and even have PTSD moments recently of the things she has done to me.

Around the age of 16, I started standing up for myself, this would lead to me yelling with my mother, arguing with her and talking back. I only did this when I couldn't take her abusive talk and nature anymore. My mother is the type to say and do horrible things and never admit to them.

To explain the current situation:

- Yesterday my mother and I had an argument just because I wanted to ask a simple question. This was not rude, disrespectful or ill-mannered.  
- This resulted in her deciding she wants ""nothing to do with me, just wants me out of the house"". My mother left later that day and said she wants me out of the house or she's not coming home. When I didn't leave because I couldn't and would have nowhere to go, she called the police and they never turned up. She said she would not come home until I was gone.  
- My mother ended up coming home at midnight when she realised the police never came (she has cameras all over the house).  
- My father lives 2 hours away and cannot come get me because he has work during the day.  
- I was going to quit my job this week but last week my mother pressured me into staying at my job last week, which has now left me in a tough situation because she wants me out now, meaning I can't work.   
- My mother was going to pay for my studio where I'm living for university, I'm not sure if I'm still doing that.  
- I am currently learning to drive and she pays half of the lessons with my father doing the other half.

Today, I tried to talk to my mother and she said ""I have nothing to say to you, I just want you out of my house.""

I have no friend I could stay with, my godparents are all busy and my father cannot come and collect me.   
I have work tomorrow and I have an electrical key that she can deactivate. If I leave the house she may deactivate it and I will have nowhere to go. If anyone has any advice please help.

I may add extra to this because I feel like I'm missing a few things.

"My mother is abusive. I have two sisters, one is autistic. She constantly beats them up, especially the autistic one. She used to do that to me too, but I can fight back now. I did today. I hit my mother and I snatched my sister away from her. She ruined my room. I ruined everything. I can't run away yet, I'm not 18. Even if I do run away, I don't think I can take my sisters with me ince they're too young. I tried to run today but she blocked the door. I apologized just necause I have to but i don't think she's ever gonn ttrust me againt. I ruined everything. I cant escape. what shudl i do"
"My mother is an alcoholic and a narcissistic personality who struggles with accountability and ever since my brother died a year ago she’s been getting worst. 

From blacking out to calling me names randomly and even physically assaulting me and now I feel that she is exploiting me. 

My mom, stepdad and 3 sisters live in a Dc home. For context I am 21 and my sister’s are 23, 18 and 16. 

My mom has me paying her 500$ for rent for my room monthly although I have NO air conditioning or Circulating cold air. (everyone else in the house has an AC except me) We moved in a few months ago. I can’t open my windows for circulation because there are tens of flies outside my window constantly from the garbage cans in the back yard. The weather is 74 degrees outside and it is 4am (I woke up from the sweating) The humidity is exhausting and my room feels like it’s minimal 87 degrees. My room is the first room to heat up so quickly and harshly and it also gets the hottest in the house. 

Here’s the thing
When the summertime started I noticed everyone had a AC except for myself and my mother. (My mom had an AC at first but they broke it) One day I was in the basement looking for a fan and found a fan and an AC, The fan was clearly from the previous owners as it was full of dust so I had to clean it off with baby wipes and paper towels for usage, I also spotted a broken AC and decided to take it upstairs and fix it. 
I completely fixed the Ac and started using it until my mother came into my room two days later and noticed the AC and demanded that I give her back the AC that they had broken and left in the basement even if I fixed it to use now. So now I am constantly waking up because it feels like 100 degrees in my room and it gets so hot that it physically frustrates me. I regularly have to leave sometimes because it gives me a mental break down with how hot it is and how it makes me feel.

Why didn’t my step dad or mom buy a new one when theirs broke and why did he tell my mom to take my AC and leave me with nothing right after I fixed the AC and brought it to my room after they neglected it and threw it in the basement?! 

I know this will cause problems but I don’t know what to do and I cant afford to buy my own AC right now. 

For anyone that made it this far (thanks for reading) What should I do?"

"okay hi reddit, this is my first post and it's a lot, but i need advice. i just turned 18 this april and have graduated high school the month after, so i'm on my summer break right now before i start college and major in art to possibly become a ceramicist/ potter. i don't currently have a job right now (i'm trying to get one, no one's been hiring or accepting me so it's very hard atm), but i wanna save up money and move out from my abusive parents and family and live my own life, do whatever i want whenever i want and be with whoever i want. basically just be free and start a new chapter of my life!

my parents are very religious people (they're muslim and worship islam and allah, but i'm not), so it's hard to talk to them about certain things relating to my love life and sexuality (i'm bi and trans, but they don't know that). i'm gay and have a boyfriend, but they don't know that either (if they did, i would be homeless). another thing to mention is that my parents are also bosnian, so even more struggle!! :3 they're immigrants and came to america fleeing from the bosnian war that went on and they wanted to build us a life here, so here i am

they don't really let me go out a whole lot because they don't trust me with things from the past (for example, i missed some days at school bc i would skip, but i still went and finished), them catching me sneaking out of my window and house, the excuses and lies i would give them, and they constantly interrogate me and ask what i'm doing in my life. they're physically and mentally abusive and i've been having many hurtful, evil, and inhumane things said about me to my face from them along with some of my other siblings. they comment about my appearance, say that i'm not good enough and never will be, how i'll never meet anyone in life, how i won't be successful in the future, basically everything there is to say, they've said it to me. they've also said how they should've never gave birth to me and how it would've been better if i wasn't here, my own parents too!! unbelievable, but what can i possibly do about it lol (move tf out and leave them for good). my older sister (turning 24) moved from my parents bc they also found out that she had a boyfriend (at the time) and she didn't want this life, so i helped her take her things out her window and said my goodbyes. we still keep in contact and see each other today, but she started saving her money when she was 16, and i have some bad spending habits, but i've been getting better at it and been realizing my wants and needs. they've cut off contact completely and don't speak or see each other. she hasn't seen my parents in years, but they've known where she moved from and where she would go, which is really scary and super stalker-ish because idk why they care when she's an adult and has her own life with someone else???? super weird.. i don’t want my parents to find out where my boyfriend lives or where i’ve been going so they can camp out and stalk me (like they have before)

here's my situation:
recently, i had a fight with my younger sister and our childhood friend who we're really close with, and they've said many things about me and how they don't like the things i do (like smoking weed with my bf) and i've apologized for my mistakes and told them that i would be better from now on. they're not talking to me until they've seen that i've changed, i understand that, but what they don't understand is what my boyfriend is like (they've never met him or talked to him once) other than the stuff i tell them (the good and bad). my boyfriend and i have been facing some problems in our relationship recently, but we always find a way to thoroughly communicate with each other and try to see what we both need to do better so that we don't make the same mistake again in the future. i've been telling them about how i feel about the stuff he does (not mentioning bc it doesn't matter), but they think it's best for us to completely break up and they've been trying to separate us after we've been dating for over a year and this is the longest relationship i've ever had and the most happy and free i've ever felt from anyone else. they think that he's a bad influence and that i can meet someone else in college, but i don't wanna breakup and he doesn't either, it's just not happening. with that, my parents have been suspicious of me drinking or smoking weed because i went to the movies and took a couple edibles and they saw that i wasn't okay, when i felt like i could speak and walk fine (i don't have any weed or alcohol on me). the only time i smoke weed is when i'm with my boyfriend, and i'm not with him 24/7 every day, i can only hangout when both my parents are at work or go to a friends, and even then, i still sneak out and track where they are (i can see on my messages where they're at be you can send your location indefinitely, but have to delete it from their recently deleted so they don't know ur tracking them, you can track them but they can't track you). i've been a lot more safer recently, coming home before they do and been taking my car out sometimes because me and my boyfriend don't go on many dates, but started to more recently. they haven't caught me until my younger sister told my mom that i always go out, and she also started telling my dad in spite of anger when i’ve BEEN trying to gain their trust back and have been in good terms with them, no problems or suspicions until now. since then, my parents haven't trusted anything i said or where i tell them i'm going when i've texted, called, facetimed, sent own pictures to them and they STILL don't believe me all because of my younger sister who snitched. my relationship with her is over, she's told me how she feels and i told her how i feel, but she's so hardheaded and doesn't understand what my life is like and doesn't wanna be in it anymore, so i'll let her make that choice, but when i make a choice, everyone gets in my way of it for why??

when i was at my friends house with her, both of them went through my phone (which isn't okay AT ALL btw????? it's privacy and basic respect, why tf would you go through my phone when i wouldn't do that to you even if i was that upset?? lifelong childhood friend who i thought i could trust allowing this to happen btw) and were looking at the messages between me and my boyfriend and said how disappointed they were in me because they think that i drunk and drove the night of the movies, when i tried to explain to them that i didn't and they still didn't believe me. i went to his house later that day to try and talk about what we're gonna do (i came unannounced, he was confused), and they kept calling me along with my parents asking what i was doing and i almost got hit about three times because i was stressed while driving and told them that the number one cause for crashes/death when driving is texting and driving, not drugs or alcohol or lack of sleep, yes they can be contributors, but it's not the number one cause. i'm also not that dumb enough to drink and drive, i can kill myself and others and i know that, i don't know why they won't believe me when i've told them the truth about taking too many edibles and how i've apologized and said that I would quit completely (i'm gonna cut back a lot, but i'm not doing it or talking about it around them anymore, around anyone; my friends smoke too but idk why it's a problem when i do it, i’m only trusting myself bc they made me realize that, do not trust anyone no matter how much you love them or how long you’ve known them for because they will stab your back someday just like me. i’m still smoking weed and doing what i want, but barely than how much i was doing which wasn’t even a lot btw but sure, they think i’m some kind of crack head who has no money and looks for only weed in life when i don’t need it at all and can walk away from it, i just like how it makes me feel bc it’s relaxing and calming, the only time i don’t feel constant pressure and it’s MY decision, i don’t see a big deal with it when my same friend vapes nicotine and posts tiktok’s of her ghosting constantly when i don’t do that? in her car too but sure yeah i’m the high one driving “dangerously” when you’ve never been in the car with me and when you constantly vape and are with your boyfriend too). i know that they're worried for me and don’t want me to get hurt or get a dui and go to jail, but i've never drove high once and i've felt fine the whole time, i'm a really good driver and my boyfriend agrees, i took a driving class and know how to be safe on the road, i’m not an imbecile. after that, i turned back around and went home. my younger sister took my keys away from me, threw a water bottle and spilt it all over my face, yelling and crying and we had a talk later that night which she walked away from. she said she doesn't know what to do anymore and i told her the same thing, she wants me to go back to being the “old me”, but people change and i’ve changed, i love myself now more than ever, not the past version of myself. like people say, the past stays in the past, only focus on the present and future. people are so worried about the past and future, nobody really takes time to appreciate the present. just slow down and live life to its fullest, you’re not in a rush and don’t ever make yourself or anyone rush you. 

recent situation:
i was hanging out with my boyfriend this morning because we go to this store every tuesday with cheap stuff (they open at 8am, but the line starts forming around 6-7am), but i go to my boyfriends house before so i can see him and his dogs for a little bit before i leave. my mom starts calling me around 6:30am asking me where i was (she had to take my dad to work) and i told her i was at the store, but ofc she doesn't believe me and says that she's gonna go and see if i'm in there. i quickly rush out and start driving trying to beat her (he lives 15 min away from me, but about 25 away from the store) and i made it in line and she facetimes me, i answer and she asks me to show her and i showed her and she believed me. when i was about three away, she was six and it was really scary because i didn't want her to see me on the road. my bf met up with me later. my mom never came to see if i was there, but she came later before i left to give me money to put into my bank account bc i recently broke my phone and had to use my own money to pay for a new one, but they didn't know until a couple days before. she told me to go to the bank and go home after and that she would call my sister to make sure i was home at 9. i went to chick fil a to eat breakfast with my bf and then went to the bank and to a thrift store across from us. he left his car at chick fil a, so i thought i could drive him because i checked where my mom was at and it said that she was at work (she works at 10, this was around 9:30), but she was in the parking lot at the thrift store waiting for me and saw my boyfriend get out of my car!!! she called me and was yelling telling me to come over there and we had about a 10 minute talk in the parking lot about life and shit which i couldn't wait to get over. i was freaking out, we were both crying and she was telling me how she wanted to be nice and just have a good relationship with me, but i go out and do this stuff to her and ""make her sick."" (she had breast cancer last year, but is healthy now and blamed it on me saying that i ""caused it on her"" and if i'm trying to kill her) she asked if he was my boyfriend and why he was in my car, i told her that i didn't know him and he just asked me if he could have a ride because he didn't have a car on him and i said sure because i wanted to do something nice when no one else would and he had a foot injury (which he actually did). she said that she understands that, but i shouldn't take people in my car other than my sister (when i've been driving for over a year and have had my license since october but ok, 7 months of having my FULL license and i still can’t take anyone around but my little sister lmfaoo little do they know). she said that she was gonna go inside and take a picture of him to send my dad (he left before she went in there thank God, a guy he knew drove him back to his car and my mom didn't see him again, i think she was saying that to threaten me and that she didn't actually mean it bc i told her that she could go ahead lol it's not like it matters bc idk him anyways) and that he knows where i am at all times but doesn't wanna tell me, how if i wanna move to just tell them and leave, how she wants me to find a bosnian man and marry him (most of them suck and have the same morals like my parents and cheat a lot, and i already have someone in my life), and how if she saw me dating that man in public, she would rather see me in the ground on my deathbed than with him. yes you heard that right, my own mother who gave birth to me said that she would rather commit suicide than see her own child with a white american man. she said she would rather kill herself than see us two together, and when i heard that, it fucking broke everything in me. imagine hearing that from your mother?? looking right in her eyes too, she asked me if i was lying and to swear on her life that i wasn't seeing him, and i swore on her life and mine and i think she finally believed me, she kept saying how she feels like i'm just covering up making some kind of story because i'm beautiful and how i need to find someone in the future and she said okay, go home don't let this happen again.

after all of this, nobody likes me being with my boyfriend when he tries to be there for me when he can, but he knows how my parents are like and has apologized multiple times and wishes that i could live a normal life away from them and be with him and his family, but i can't because i have a younger sister and brother to take care of, and they wouldn't have anybody but themselves if i were to leave. everyone is dependent on me when i try so hard to be independent and live my own life without anyone getting in the way of it, but they still do no matter how hard i try. i'm getting so exhausted and drained for having to live my whole life in pure fear and survival, like when do i get to finally be happy and free and do what i want and come home and eat whenever i want, have my own job and be a tattoo artist, get an apprenticeship for that and actually start living my life? why do people constantly have to ""make"" these decisions for me when i know myself better than anyone else and what's good for me?? my parents think that all the stuff i like (rock, heavy metal, cowboys and westerns, music, 70s-90s, rap, clothes, piercings, tattoos) are all “satanic devil worshipping” things, even though it’s not, but they’re too dumb to realize. i can’t even wear a crop top without being called a slut before i leave the house in one hundred degree weather, but when someone with a smaller chest wears one, it’s fine because it’s socially accepted and normalized, but when i do it, it’s not okay and i’m called a slut for it???? it’s so unfair and i can’t keep getting mistreated and beat down in my young adulthood, my best years. i know that people are just trying to look out and want the best for me, but going about it this way is so toxic and makes me fall heavier on depression. everyone looking through my stuff, my mom finding my empty flask of liquor that i drank from long before, my cart, my sex toys, thongs, lingerie, all of it. even when i clean my room, she loves to dig for any secrets i’ve been keeping to find some reason to kick me out, have one less mouth to feed. i feel like nobody has been wanting me in their lives and feel like everything is my fault and that i'm the cause of it all, when everyone else is living their life with ""no problems"", or they're at least not thinking they did or caused anything onto me, when they’re at fault too and i’m waiting for an apology back. not to mention, but i had a year anniversary post on my insta, and they were texting saying how upset and betrayed they felt that i would choose him over them, even though it’s not true and i’ve said that.. i didn’t mean it to spite against them, and i can see how it might’ve come across that way; they thought i was ignoring them, but i didn’t wanna read their messages bc i had so much on my mind and wasn’t ready, and i apologized). 

i was originally planning to move out next summer so that i could get my first year of college done with and get used to my schedule and campus. i have my whole first year payed for, and i would be paying out of pocket for textbooks, meals, student loans, etc. in december, i have a month long break where i'll be working the whole time trying to save up. i could move that month/semester, but i wanna try and get my first year of school done so i know how things work and am more familiar. my dad, sister, and i had a long discussion about his plans for the future and he says that in four years, he's taking my mom and brother and moving back to bosnia (leaving me and my younger sister here, i'll be in my third year of college, my sister will be a freshman in college, and my brother will be a freshman in high school) and my dad said that he's willing to give my sister and i the house because he knows that apartments are really expensive and how it's dangerous living beside a bunch of strangers and how we were born and raised here, so he more than understands and will give it to us to decorate however we want and to do whatever we want. we'd have our own garage, backyard, pool, rooms, etc. that would be in 2028 or 2029, and i don't know if i can wait that long just to get a house with someone who i don't wanna live with just to get a year out of it paying for cheaper bills, there's just no point in making my parents wait when my sister wouldn't wanna live with me by then and my parents wanting to take the money from selling the house. if i go my first year at college and get financial aid and have my parents pay for the second year, i could move out that summer and they wouldn't even have to know. we're planning on going to bosnia next year i think? so that could be our last family trip together, i could probably have a car by then (my sister gets her full license in march/april, but idk if the title will be in my name bc i asked my dad about that and he said the only people who ask that question are people who wanna move out). i have a car, but it's in my dads name so it's technically his, but if i don't, i can get my own or drive my boyfriends car. i don't know the first step of moving out (if you have abusive, narcissistic, hypocritical parents like me) or understand anything about how much you should have saved up, what to look out for, getting your own car, transferring banks, transferring mail addresses, getting a credit card, getting a new phone plan, etc. any advice would help, should i move out this year or next year before things escalate and get worse? i can’t stay four years, i know it’s better financially, but i know that i can’t hold out that long with the past trauma i already have. i love my boyfriend so much and he wants to help me in every way to try and get me away from lifelong abuse and trauma. i know that i’m young and it might be too soon moving in with him, but i know that he would take the best care of me as i would do for him, and we’d have everything figured out and properly planned. even if we run along problems later down the way, we’ll figure it out together and we made a promise to stay together and not leave each other for someone else. as dumb as it is, i love him and would do anything for him, and he would do the same. i could move in with his parents for a while until we find our own place, or i could stay with his grandma or we can get an rv/trailer and live in there for a couple of months, maybe we can build our own  house in his backyard bc he has a smoke spot for himself, so i have options, i’ll have a roof above my head. i only have about $200 on me right now and i know it isn’t enough to move out, but i’m starting somewhere and i’ll have a thousand before (hopefully at least 3k) i move out since i’ll be getting a job soon. he has way more money than i have and comes from a supportive family, so if i told them my situation, they would understand and try to help me since i have a good relationship with them and they like me, they also have a family owned business and could get me a job right away (i’d get paid more than i have before with $10.25). my mom says that she’s gonna ask my dad to retrieve all my phone numbers and messages and ask who i’ve been texting and calling when idk if he can check my messages, but i know he can see my numbers. would he still be able to check my messages if my carrier is t-mobile, or are they saying that just to threaten me? if i changed my phone plan, would they be able to know like get notified or something? can they actually track my phone and see where i am at all times, or are they lying about that too? just another threat that i shouldn’t take seriously, or should i start taking them seriously? i know a lot of parents say that as a threat, but can’t actually do it, but my parents are very smart, so idk if they’re lying about that or not. my boyfriend and i have told people that we’re “breaking up” bc we know that’s what everyone wants, but we’re just taking a break from each other for a couple of months and keeping things on the down-low so that nobody suspects anything. we’re still gonna see each other sometimes, but the only difference is that i can’t have my own sister knowing because she could be the whole reason of why or if i get kicked out. i don't wanna get kicked out because of the man i love being with and the quick, harsh judgment from others, please help with anything you have"
"I'm going to tell what happened to me (33F) because I no longer wish to cover up for anyone: All my life I suffered verbal and physical abuse from my mother. She blamed me because, according to her, when I was born, her ex-husband ""showed his claws"" and began to mistreat her. I tried to help her the best I could, believing that once we were alone everything would be different. But it wasn't like that. She blamed me for making her report him and would get furious with me for no reason, saying I had promised her she would be happy without him. After a painful breakup with an abusive man similar to my mother, I decided I didn't want to live like that for the rest of my life. Then I met a man (30M) who seemed good. Knowing about the abuse, he proposed living with him...and his parents. His father kept to himself, but his mother was very intrusive. All our arguments were about her, never our relationship. One day, after an incident with his mother, he raised his fist at me while driving and accelerating a car that wasn't even his but his mother's. It was traumatic. He always said I had traumas because of my mother, but he generated that trauma in me. My heart broke because the man who was supposedly loving and protecting me had the intention to hurt me. The worst part is he blamed me for everything. He insists he's not violent, that I've pushed him to the limit. I'm still affected and cry every time I remember it. I'm no longer with him, I live with a friend and don't have the problems I had at his mother's house. I wasn't the problem. It's true I need to heal, but he has serious problems as well. I don´t want him back, I just want to heal to have a good relationship.

"Officially going no contact with my cheating narc father. I posted on another forum but I need all the advice I can get. I finally confronted him after years of him cheating on and emotionally and physically abusing my mother and his responses were “Sure. You had such a difficult childhood. I don’t know how you survived.” And “it’s none of your business” 
I just want to feel validated. Will he ever admit the truth? And why does he stay married to my mother when he clearly doesn’t love her?"
"Note: Im 19, mother 45 or smth, my older sister is 20, younger brother is 17  
  
I've been confused recently and it's just the situation I was placed under and how it is altering events. Recently I tried to commit due to my mother's outburst as she destroyed everything I had; including my clothes, my art, and my items within my room, this was all because of me being myself in dressing the way I wanted to. Note that in the past she has been aggressive and abusive including, starving me, calling me a wh\*re, or any other derogatory terms. She never loved me and always told me I was never part of this family. So I decided to do her a favor and remove myself permanently. I was on the verge of overdose and I tried my hardest to just pass out but I decided to talk to my counselor that I was going to commit leading me to the doctors trying to take the toxins out of me. When they were allowed to visit, no one came besides my aunt who was there and said if my mother did not accept me as her daughter she was always there. For the first time, I realized my mother never treated me like her own child like she treated her other two other children. My mother did eventually come but all she did was tell me that it was my fault for being here and she should've just talked it out when I had the chance and she was not really that mad. She only said that because she did not want to cause a huge fuss over what happened in front of everyone it was so fake; I believed it though cause I just wanted closure even if it was fake. I ended up going to the phyceward for a 51/50 stay but when I was gone it got worse my brothers noted that I called her a b\*tch for the longest time as if they never said told her that. When I was there she did try her hardest to get me out of that situation and put me on track because they were thinking about putting me there longer. Knowing that made me feel like she might be ok and accept me but when I got out I was ready to meet them all. It was like this wash of reality that I did not know them and it all seemed clear that it was just fake talk for a while to make me feel safe but in reality, it was not.   
She made it clear that I am not her daughter and I do not address her as a mother. She made me apologize to her about the lack of respect but not once did I hear her say sorry for the torture and abuse she put me through. She made me starve, beat me around till I bled, forced me to separate from my grandparents, and forced me to not have friends bc she was scared I would go around and tell. There is more to that list but those were the only things I wanted her to know that she did to me no she wants an apology for the circumstance she put me through and I needed a release of anger and took it out like that. She is no mother, she is some monster I deal with. Sure she may have given me all this but at what cost she did this to herself, and now I am turned out like this all at her expense.   
It's worse now, my siblings have separated from me because it's too much for them to handle when I talk about my mother and tell me to go get therapy. When I was in that phyceward they promised me it'd get better and be there for me. When I was out, they isolated me, shut the door off, and went out with their friends and did not even talk to me once because I had to learn a lesson. It's been harsh and I gave up on this entire family and already accepted that I am no longer part of this family. All I want is peace and be able to live freely, so im planning on leaving next year and never looking back at them. I've been lashing out in anger now at them and I don't know how to control it when I see them, they get me so annoyed and disgusted.

I've been putting guilt on for just existing but now I want to understand if my anger is justified now or am I being dramatic. Am I even allowed to give up on them or should I still try? My older sister is offering therapy but complains she needs to save up, I don't even know anymore, im so lost in what to do with this family and how to be a part of it if theirs even a chance. "
"Hi. I’m 20, non binary, and have struggled with anxiety, depression, and undiagnosed learning disorders for years. 
I moved out of my house to live with my boyfriend and it’s been wonderful. But right now I’m on a trip with my mother overseas.

I’m on the autism spectrum and my parents don’t believe me. Especially my mom. She constantly ignores me when I ask for accommodations such as staying home for a day or needing to go to the mental hospital (she refused to take me).

On this trip, I had about enough of this type of treatment. She yells at me all the time, treats me like I’m the worst thing to happen to her, threatens to slap me, calls me names such as a “shit ass child”, and I constantly have to be careful about what I say to her because I never know if she’s going to be angry with me. She yells at me when I slightly disagree with her or tell her I need help. I used to be afraid to get in her car for the fear of being yelled at. I could never tell how she was going to react. 

She disregards my feelings for her own. She said “parenting doesn’t come with an instruction manual”.

I finally snapped on this trip… I had 2 huge meltdowns and all my mom had to say to me was “this trip was expensive” and that “I’m ungrateful”. Which I’m not… I’m very thankful that I get to travel.. just not thankful that it’s with her. She said to me last night that she “doesn’t know who I am anymore” and “maybe it’s the medication but you’re not my daughter” (again I’m non binary and have told her this multiple times). I yelled at her last night telling her that she’s the reason I act like this. I couldn’t take it anymore and I just yelled and screamed and told her all of the shit she did that messed me up. I can’t remember a good portion of my childhood anymore. 

Now she’s upset and will most likely blame me for ruining the trip. All she had to say to me was “I’m sorry I ruined your life” and cried. And complained that she was sick.

I don’t know if I did the wrong thing or not. I feel bad but I don’t. I’m tired of being treated like my best is never good enough for her. 
My grades, my “attitude”, everything. I told her she needed to go to therapy because she has some unresolved issues she needs to take care of but she doesn’t think she does. 

AITA? Or was this bound to happen?"
Did that get to anyone else? My dad told me that after my mom was screaming at me all day and chasing me around shoving me like she would do all the time. I believed it for a while and it really drove in my depression farther but I’ve recently been thinking about it realized that my cat loves me plenty so it’s proven false now. I hope that someday a human could too but I know it still won’t happen if I can’t get past my mental issues. Has anyone else here been told that they’ll never be loved as much as their abusive mother does and had it get to them?
"I’m writing this because I need to know that I am not the only person who is living it, it’s hard for me to open up but I finally reached to this point where I need to hear others opinions, my dad left when I was very young, my mom developed a rare neurological condition that almost paralysed and killed her, there’s no cure for this illness, and it’s very progressive, that was 13 years Ago, ever since my dad left my mom needed financial support and the only way she was able to get it was through the help of her brother, a very controlling inconsiderate hurtful person who never let us live, throughout those 13 years my moms mental health was getting worse, she started abusing pills and smoking cigarettes in insane amounts, of course she was spending the money where it shouldn’t be spent, my dad lived with his parents and was secretly married, his family always pushed us away to a point where they actually cut us off completely, of course my dad never stood up for us (back then) so we were very much involved in my mothers family, because again  her illness is progressive, it got worse and worse recently, we spent the past 3 years of our life in hospitals and  ER,  saving her life because she has now multiple illnesses, of course our health was and still is neglected and our needs were never addressed, the focus was always on saving her life, she is very unhealthy doesn’t have a basic understanding about her illness and doesn’t chose what is best for it, she is that self destructive, she’s disabled and can’t be left on her own, me and my siblings put our lives education and future on hold to be able to save her, but her brother sees otherwise he keeps blaming us controlling us and holds us in to not do anything ever that would take us away from them, he knows that she is irresponsible but keeps feeding her self destruction and whenever it goes wrong we get abused for it, 13 years of inconsideration, 13 years of neglect and control. 13 years forced to take all of the responsibility 13 years of not even being able to express thoughts  or opinions because we grew up tip toeing intimidated and living under the mercy of people who don’t know logic, and so many other details, I’m so scared of traumas I will be finding out about later on , if I ever get the chance or the space to take care of myself…."

I think I’m just sensitive but I want ppls opinions

I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) since high school (went to same school). We’re about to have our 5th anniversary coming up in the summer. We truly are compatible. I’d be lying if we of course didn’t have normal tiffs, but nothing very serious where we ever considered ending/breaking the relationship (basic stuff that I get over dramatic ab like wanting to go on more dates and such). He really is a dream. He treats me VERY well, more than I deserve. Has never made me feel less and always makes sure I’m loved. We’ve been thru a lot together. 

I’m starting PA school in the fall and he’s finishing up his Bach/master degree (combined program) in Dec. I’m going to PA school very local to me (15 min drive from my house). We’ve done long distance since we both started at a different colleges, and I’m ready to continue in our relationship and take it a step further (living together). I also have this mantra that no matter who I marry I want to live with before to ensure we are truly compatible (you learn a lot about a person when you actually cohabitate with them). So our plan is to live together beginning Jan 2025. 

Broke the news to my mom today. She was extremely against it. She just doesn’t think that he’s “enough” for me. She hasn’t made an effort to even get to know him. I come from a cultural background (middle eastern- but not Muslim- so not as strict as you’d think, but still pretty strict), and it’s often looked down upon to even date someone let alone move in with them. She’s been unsupportive since the beginning (hid the relationship for about a year or 2 before I even told my parents). She is so upset and I’m upset and idk.  I never had a close relationship to my parents anyways so I’m not HEARTBROKEN I’m going against them, but there’s some sort of “oldest daughter” guilt in me that I need to please my parents and be a “good girl”.  Haven’t told my dad yet, I’m not sure how he’ll react. He’s been a bit more supportive of the relationship, I’ve kinda hinted I would want to move in, I just don’t think he thought this soon. 

I think I just want reassurance that I’m not a failure bc I don’t follow what my parents want. I’m not being totally insane and horrible for wanting to live with him right?? And also please play devils advocate, I want to see from the other POV too! Idek if I’m posting this in the correct thread but I thought I’d give it a shot. I know it’s not a crazy juice AITA, but I’d love any insight:) thank you everyone"
"I'm 26 and my mother was horrible in the sense she put herself and her children through immense stress and trauma for making bad decisions.   
I grew up listening to their fights with my step father, anxiously aware of when her attitude had change even slightly and spending the rest of the day having to deal wirh her and knowing she was going to blow up with me or my father and later with me.   
As you can imagine this is just the tip, they luckily never were physically abusive but I wish they had been instead of everything else they did.   
I'm a hermit, I have no social life, no hobbies, no life plan or goal, I began contemplating suicide from early adolescence and I lived life waiting to die because I just couldn't picture my life changing for the better.
With the years this issued have just compounded and my mother's attitude changed, she has ""read"" a lot of spirituality, of the soul, the ""journey"", the psychology of ""letting go of the hurt to grow stronger"" and a bunch of other shit, all basically leading up to now where she sends me video after video after tiktok after tiktok all about ""your parents did what they could but now you are older and you need to see they werent so bad and find a job""  all while avoiding the fact I'm fucked up in ways that make it impossible for me to just ""man up"" like she so pushes me to do.  
I've had fights with her for for a decade by now about this, I wish I could leave here that i could find a job, but i get panic attacks from just being in public spaces and simple arguments and discussions make me so weak that I start to tremble and sweat, but she never stops gaslighting me that ""everybody has anxiety they just deal with it and go to work"". 
I just wish I could say something to change this situation, if I could I'd live in s shoe box just to get away from his house."
I was trying to relax after how humid it was today at practice (cross country). I was just relaxing downstairs with the lights off. My dad came down to take pictures of my bed to sell it (they’re getting me a new one). So then dad turned on all the lights on. So when he left and I went to turn them back on my stepmom shouted from upstairs “Turn the lights back on stop being emo” and “Stop acting like your depression was as bad as it was” I’m really hurt by this but can’t cry because if I do I’m going to get a lecture.
"I have always been abused by my parents , physically , emotionnaly , and they would do horrible things to me , and i also have bullies at school . I struggle with many mental health problems now . I have a lot of dreams and goals in life , and i want to cut ties with them and with my family so that i can heal and build myself a beautiful life . Actually , i'm 13 years old and i'm planning to get into a college into a foreign country and distance myself from them . ( I don't know  if i'm overthinking)  But i'm really scared of them to say nasty things about me in social media or in tv  to affect my life ( even thought i would be in a different country ) , and i'm also scared of that to ruin my social life ( like would someone like to befriend a person that has cut ties with their own family and parents ? ) . I feel lonely , and i don't know if it would get better ."
"I'm a (20F) first-generation immigrant who grew up in the UK with South Asian parents. My upbringing was harsh, and I often wished for different parents. >!Between the ages of 5 and 8, my father would force me to memorize times tables, using tree branches to hit me when I made mistakes. !<I hid this abuse from my teachers because I feared the consequences at home and didn't want my parents taken away. My parents downplayed my feelings and discouraged me from making friends, claiming they hindered success, which in turn made it difficult to socialise.>!In high school, I struggled with my home life and contemplated suicide.!< Eventually, I pushed myself to make friends and become more confident. I love my younger sibling (12M) immensely but fell into the trap of acting as a third parent, being responsible for his school work and behaviour at a young age. At 18, I moved out to create a life for myself and set boundaries with my parents, but I now struggle with hyper-independence. Despite my efforts to please my parents, I always feel like it's never enough and that I am to blame when things go wrong. I visit my parents every few months to maintain a connection with my sibling, but their negativity takes a toll on me. Despite the trauma, I work in healthcare, providing rehab to mental health patients and find fulfillment in this. I have a supportive long-distance partner who helps me heal. However, he holds a negative view of my parents, which makes me feel guilty. I feel emotionally exhausted and traumatized at 20. I often vent to a close friend who understands, but we don't know how to find a solution. While I have received counselling in high school and learned to set boundaries, further therapy and medication don't appeal to me. I acknowledge that my parents have made mistakes, but I don't believe they can change. I struggle with showing and receiving affection from them and resent the fact that I had to mature too quickly. I want to move forward with strategies from others that have similar trauma in order to avoid feeling terrible whenever I see my parents. I want to break the cycle and have healthier relationships.

Thanks in advance <3"
My father has been abusive since the day i was born he would always tell me I'm a fucking pussy or im a retard and worthless.

"I was raised in an upper middle class household. I never had to really worry about money when I was younger so I always felt I was blessed. Around 8th grade, my father began to show signs of mental health deterioration. He was an alcoholic and always in a terrible mood. He wasnt too physical with me unless it was for normal parental discipline but it was an ABSOLUTE PAIN to be around him. He would often fake punch me when I walk past him (like a fucking kid) and one time he got me on my nose and naturally I got mad at him and instead of apologizing or anything at all he yelled at me for yelling at him. I would rarely ever even attempt to talk to him on a daily basis because it would always end in him getting angry and staring angrily deep into my soul and trying to belittle me. The most annoying example is when I would try to give him advice. It was like a fucking sin for me to try to give this dude advice since I was a kid and he was an adult. It really pissed me off when it would smoke (he would smoke 2 packs of cigs a day) and then come inside and start kissing my dog. It made me stay away from my dog because then they would both end up wreaking of cigarette smoke. One time, I asked him if he could maybe wash his hand and rinse his mouth after smoking before touching the dog after (I worded it kindly with a positive tone and wasnt being confrontational) and he flipped out on me and made it such a big deal saying that it was disrespectful for me to tell him to change something he was doing.

This stuff got really bad during covid, but sort of in a different sense. My dad stopped antagonizing me. I think its because I had a pretty big growth spurt and I was putting on a decent amount of muscle so he couldnt intimidate me like he used to, so he basically stopped communicating with me all together. We lived in the same house for about two years straight without a full conversation (this was so fucking weird). I almost would have rather been yelled at than this. We would still see each other around the house but he would just stare me down without a word as almost as if he were trying to intimidate me. I would always try to avoid him around the house. Sometimes I would wake up and not go downstairs on weekends. to avoid him and just listen through my door and wait for him to leave or go somewhere. during covid I would either stay in my room or the basement for multiple days at a time only coming out for food and water. 

My parents got divorced literally right when I turned 18. I dont even care about the implications behind this, but this is when my real depression started. I was already riddled with anxiety (before the stuff with my dad) and that stuff just made it much worse, and then going to college on top of all of this had me in a terrible place. I thought about my relationship with my parents a lot during this time and started to think that I was the problem. I would rationalize my fathers actions thinking that he was just really depressed and upset that nobody was helping him with it thus causing him to resent his family. The sad part is that the only reason I even thought that maybe thats what he is going through, is because that is how I started to feel. I love my mother, but I also always resented her for never caring about my mental health. Ever since I was a little kid, I had these anxious tics where I would scrunch my face uncontrollably. My mother would always yell at me for this (my father surprisingly didnt care or even acknowledge this like ever). She was call it a bad habit that I needed to stop and I always wanted to tell her that I couldnt control it. I learned over time to not do it in public, but still, to this day (im 21 now and a rising senior in college) I do it when im alone sometimes. 

Now for the resolution of this long ass post, the mixing of memories. Once my father left (im 18 at the time and a freshmen in college), It was just my mom and my sister. I was super depressed and I remember I would either act out and be super bland and whenever I was home for breaks. I didn't realize this at the time but I believe I did this as a way to try to get my mom to acknowledge anything about my mental health. I started smoking weed in the house the summer after freshman year of college (this was a pretty strict house and I had never once EVER even so much as cursed out loud) so this FINALLY made her say something. But this kind of upset me even more because all she did was suggest I go to therapy. The thing is, my mother seems to care a lot about me at times. She makes sure I am fed well, she works her ass off to help pay the interest for my tuition, and cooks me nice meals every once in a while, and it makes me feel like such an asshole to resent her. I still love her so much, but I cant really tell if I am truly wrong for this. I didnt read this post over so I hope it even makes sense, also this is my first reddit post ever an I have never told anyone about my family life not even any of my closest friends. I didnt even talk to my mother about feelings immediately after the divorce and it was treated like any other day. I feel like im losing my mind sometimes keeping all this shit in. I feel like my friends wont take it seriously if I tell them. I mean, there are so many other kids who are beaten by their parents and have no money and I feel like shit when this stuff makes me depressed. Am I crazy?"
"To Give background I got a lease with my mother in a two bedroom apartment. When we first got it both of our names were required to be on the lease agreement. A year later I got into law school. I left late August and the lease was up in October. When that time rolled around she begged me to sign for another year so I did. I came back for Christmas break and everything was fine. When I came home for summer she moved someone into my room. This individuals name is not on the lease and is a ex felon. When I came home all of my stuff was gone through and multiple things were unaccounted for. Since being home my mother and I have been arguing most every night. I don’t like my stuff being touched, but that keeps happening. The individual is up at all hours keeping me awake. And when I get upset about it they both act like I am dramatic. Basically my mom says nothing and lets him run the house and do whatever he wants. I have started a job at the airport and have crazy hours and need my sleep but he will be up cooking steak at 4-5 in the morning. They are both great at playing the victim. Something that blew my mind was I was woken up and the grwn man had his mother come over and have my mother and I “Talk things out” I did not ask for this and did not say she can move this in, in my legal binding contract. She claims it’s to help her get on her feet with finances but she does not work all but two days a month. I feel disrespected and uncomfortable in my own house. I don’t know what to do they are good at making me seem crazy. In their minds I should work crazy hours. while they sit around all day and all night, and do whatever they want ( including dealing with a smell of a strong burning substance that filtrates through the whole house)and I should keep my mouth shut. My food and drinks are also always being taken and eaten my car was also stolen a few days after coming home so I have been working hard to get myself another car so money is tight right now now. Again I don’t know what to do I’m trapped until August. I also don’t think it is healthy to continue a relationship with my mother because not only has this situation put a strain on my relationship with her. I have caught signs of drugs. She has put me in a situation that I don’t think any mother should do. She has defended him and sided with him. She has put me in a situation where if the complex finds out I can be in some serious trouble but she doesn’t think about me but him first. She almost got us evicted from this apartment for refusing to work and pay rent. And I don’t think they would hesitate to kick all of us out if they found out. Which means I could not get an apartment to head back to law school. I think what she is doing is selfish and if she knew she could not afford it she should not have renewed this lease. I am constantly told by her to go to hell, to go fuck myself etc. any advice or comments are appreciated. Also I am starting to lose my temper. "
"I went no contact with my parents last year after my mother went on a tirade because she was jealous of other people in my life. There were good moments with my parents in my childhood, but also a lot of bad and scary moments. My mom is an alcoholic (most likely narcissistic or BPD) and my dad has anger issues/low emotions. My mom was obsessed with me. She would say she was jealous of boyfriends for being able to touch me, friends, etc. She has tried to blackmail me in the past. She kicked me out once because I told her I couldn’t come see her during my college finals. There was also an element of sexual abuse but I am trying to be vague so it’s not too obvious. 

My mom texted me again today asking me if there is any hope for our relationship. I think she desperately wants a relationship with me, but every time in the past that I’ve tried, it has ended badly. The second I set boundaries, she loses it and claims I “can’t hold things from the past against her.” My heart breaks to know she is hurting. I don’t want that and I think everyday about the pain. It’s the last thing I want. But I do not think it is healthy for me to be around her. Being around her puts me on edge. My nervous system still reacts to her as it did when I was a child/undergoing the abuse. I’m so much happier and healthier the last year of my life and the only thing that changed was removing them. 

Has anyone ever reconciled and it actually worked? How did you know you were ready?"
"I left the house hold. I am free! But it still hurts. I thought the pain would go as soon as I left but it hurts worse now. I'm glad I am not in the fire but now it's like I am noticing the burns I didn't before. What do you guys do to cope? I am starting to get depressed again and it's scaring me cause last time I got depressed I couldn't sleep, I couldn't wake up, I couldn't eat, I was vomiting randomly, I had a seizure, I was self harming, I was unmotivated, I had constant headaches, I just felt horrible, I feel tired. I am starting to feel like that again. I always watched porn to make things better, to feel better, but I had gotten out of that cycle. I don't feel like I need it anymore... Except lately I have felt that way. It hurts. I don't want to hurt, this is why I left. I don't get it. I don't know what to do. It just hurts. It's getting worse because it got better? Does anyone understand this?"
"I'm beginning to realize some of this stuff isn't normal. The root seems to be my parent. I am a male in my teens and my parent is a good kind man, but he's often angry and says and does stuff sometimes that I now realize he shouldn't do. Somewhat unpredictable. For example I remember him giving my little brother a nosebleed by a punch or picking me up by the shirt and pinning me against the wall. He's also said some stuff like, we both are good at using charm to get what we want out of others. I didn't think to much of it at the time and other stuff like threatening to break legs or jab us in the throat. This stuff has made me a very apathetic and cold person causing me to hurt animals and sometimes people. Due to my very strong impulse.I know I am a terrible person I just need to put this here before I delete this account. I have parental controls on my phone so who knows what might happen. But back to the title. Sometimes my brothers, my dad, and me will joke about killing the dog my little sister loves by leaving her out in the street or just killing her in some other way. She is very sensitive and cares a lot about animals. I just realized that this is hurting her. And every time she complains about we all tell her to be quiet and stop being sensitive. I realize that this is a very evil thing to say now. I do not feel bad for this but I realize this is wrong. I know I am not a great brother. I don't need to be told this. I am honestly looking for some form of reassurance? I'm not sure. Am I lying to myself? This stuff is normal to me."
"I wish I was exaggerating, but yes. Today, years of breeding, propagating plants, and thousands of dollars has all gone to waste because my mom thought my room smelled bad. I owned 20 fish tanks all bigger than 10 gallons stocked with every type of fish you can imagine. I had recently gotten a new set of cory catfish for $200 from a breeder. My mom really didn't like them because of their whiskers so I think that fueled some of it. Today I went to school, and came home to empty fish tanks and some broken glass. I screamed, and ran to my mom asking her what happened. She told me she just cleared up my room for me and I should be thankful. All fish, including my 2 foot long catfish were flushed. My plants and coral  were thrown away and my fish tanks broken. No, I cant just start again because some fish are hybrids you wouldn't find anywhere else."
"I grew up with tons of abuse from both parents. They’re both awful people. I don’t hate them, but we haven’t spoken in three years and I don’t miss them one bit nor do I feel love or connection towards them. Is this normal? I look at my boyfriend and how he has an actual family that he loves and feels connected to. They fight sometimes, sure. But it’s different. My family just felt empty and lonely and like there was never love but rather just used each other for attention seeking. Is this normal? I feel like an outsider and don’t understand the concept of family even a little bit. "
"I'm new here and I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now. I grew up in an Asian household that took education and grades very seriously. I was punished or demeaned whenever I did something bought home a slightly lower grade, or perhaps did something that my mother wasn't very fond of (no matter how small) I open the fridge for a second, I get nagged at ""don't leave the fridge open, what the hell is wrong with you, you're adding to my already high electricity bill"" as an example. However, whenever I do accomplish something, I don't recall ever being praised for it. I've always been ignored whenever I did something my mother wanted me to accomplish. ""Get a job"", okay I got a job, but it's not enough because I'm not making enough money to her standards. I tried so hard to get a sense of recognition from her. She's told me several times to kill myself because I didn't want to go to college, or that I was a horrible useless person for choosing community college. She wanted me to go to a prestigious university. I worked my ass off at community college (took 61 credits and obtained my associate degree within a year) because she didn't want me to stay at community college. I ended up getting accepted to my dream school (also the school my mom wanted me to attend). I also applied and ended up getting a scholarship worth 165k, basically giving me a full ride scholarship to any university in the U.S., and guess what? No recognition, no congratulations, nothing. Just yeah that's expected of you. Despite the fact she insisted on me going to college in the first place. It just seems like nothing I do is enough to her, no matter what I do. I feel empty despite my successes in life. I still feel worthless and all that I've accomplished is done for nothing. She never showed up to my graduations either due to commitments to ""work"" because she needed money. I should feel happy for myself, I should feel grateful for all that I've accomplished, but no. I feel nothing, I feel empty, alone, and sad. I recently got a summer internship that pays 2k a week which would add up to a 100k annual salary, but it still means nothing to her. She doesn't care. 

TL;DR: No matter how much I accomplish, my mom doesn't and never will give a shit about anything I do. "
"***tl;dr*** **25yo living with Arab-American family, feeling trapped and resentful. Dad's frustration and rage escalating since I got mentally ill and couldn't pursue medical career. He's controlling and toxic, forced my brother to marry cousin, and I'm scared of his retaliation if I try to leave. Want to break free and find healthier relationships, but worried about mom's dependence on me and dad's potential anger and possible violence.**
___

I've been living with my Arab-American family for almost 26 years. It's hard to not be grateful for all of their help. They've been paying the bills, doing the chores, cooking delicious food for decades. However, recently I've come to a dark realization. I got mentally ill, and I couldn't pursue my career anymore. And it seems like now that they know I can't make them proud, Dad is getting really frustrated. He probably thinks we're all lazybones who'd rather leech off his hard work. Now, he's a lot closer to his family abroad, and is even thinking of moving back permanently. Fights have become more common. Communication is completely broken, and resentment builds up. There's no such thing as unconditional love. I feel like a commodity, only to be loved if I complete the transaction of making him proud.

He's successfully forced my middle brother to marry his paternal cousin overseas in Iraq. The other day, he got so randomly angry at Mom that he screamed, destroyed items in the living room, and nearly beat up my mother. But I couldn't go downstairs: I'm too emotionally unavailable and mentally sick to feel like intervening. When your family solely depends on you for your happiness but you're too sick to do that, it becomes a living nightmare.

I want things to change. But I'm worried. My mother depends on me for basically everything she can't understand in English. I don't want to leave her out in the cold, metaphorically speaking. I'm also worried about my Dad, fearing his retaliation. If he can force his own flesh to go through a painful marriage, why can't he do more? I'm trying to get ready for prospects as far-fetched as him trying to kill me. But I know I have no other choice. Just like they eventually moved out of their families' homes, I must move out sooner or later. I'm tired of wasting hours every day stressing about what my Mom or Dad would think of me. I want healthier relationships, where I feel understood and cared about while being accommodated, where we can set boundaries and communicate clearly and directly.

If there is one thing I found out about my family, it's that they don't know it all. In fact, they may be doing the most toxic things, but because you're their son, you're supposed to accept it all along as normal and respect their authority, until you can't bear it anymore."
"My best friend, one of the people who's treated me the best and kindest of anyone I've ever known, who's always been there for me and who I have a very high opinion of, identifies as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns. I'd never had a nonbinary friend before, so at first I'd catch myself calling them ""he/him"" by accident, and I very occasionally still mess up now but I've gotten better about correcting myself. 

I see it as a respect thing. I was raised Christian conservative and was taught that using any pronouns outside of the ones you'd use for your assigned-at-birth gender is ""delusional and mentally ill behavior, not to mention anti-christian because Jesus made you the gender that you are."" I don't see it that way. If my friend feels happier being called they/them, then I think it's only right and respectful of me to call them by their preferred pronouns.

Well anytime I visit my parents, of course because I've adjusted to saying they/them and have been doing my best to avoid he/him, anytime I talk to or about my best friend, I refer to them by their preferred pronouns. My parents often will interrupt what I'm saying with ""You can just call him ""he/him"" here, you don't have to cater to his delusional bullsh*t here."" It makes me super annoyed and uncomfortable.

At this point I've stopped talking about my best friend as much as possible, because not only will my parents interrupt literally anytime I talk about them with ""he, (your friend) is a he."" But they both also want me to just dump my best friend over that ""issue."" My parents argue that my friend obviously isn't a very good Christian (obviously not 🤣 they're also an atheist) if ""he"" insists on me ""catering to his sinful delusions."" 

It's ridiculous. Obviously I'm not going to get rid of one of the kindest and most amazing people in my life, but I don't even know what I'm supposed to say to my parents when they tell me I should stop being friends with my friend other than ""no I'm not doing that,"" and the constant interruptions of ""he, your friend is a he,"" gets so irritating. 

The way my parents see it, my friend is a delusional anti-christ. The way I see it, my friend is important to me so if respecting and calling them by their chosen pronouns is important to them, then I see no reason why I shouldn't. 

I am also Christian, but I don't think or believe anywhere close to the way my parents do. I'd rather love thy neighbor, even thy non-christian neighbors, than spew the hate and disgusting behavior into the world that my parents do. My parents are the types of people who give us Christians a bad name and it's annoying. "
"I'm 18 almost 19 and my parents are emotionally abusive and manipulative with everything in my life. This includes how I dress and mh appearance in general. If there's something they don't like they will instantly start to yell and make it out to be such a big deal. It's become so bad that I feel mentally drained. They've told me that they treat me like shit because they feel like they've lost me as their child and have threatened on multiple occasions to kick me out. And things keep getting worse I'm currently trying to work 3 jobs to save up to move out but I don't know what to do. I feel stuck because they keep trying to control every part of my life and have also guilt tripped and threatened to disown me. They have also told me that all my life choices have always disappointed them and that I have never made a good choice even if it makes me happy. There have been points where they've even threatened to put down my dog.

Can someone please give me advice on how to deal with this? I am looking at moving out but rent is very expensive."
"So I come from a house where both my parents and 1of my siblings is abusive, my brother turned into a mini version of my father bur it cost him big time, it cost him his life... Might say it now, I am glad my abusive shithead brother is gone, I could have not care less.

Your dead arsehole and you did it to yourself. Why because he believed what my abusive parents believed, how because he did not have the balls to actually do something before it got worse. Do I give a shit... Nope.

So a little back story and hence the title of the post. So my brother R is dead. He pretty much killed himself using his diabetes, he lied to everyone about it. When did he died New years eve 2023. He would abuse his diabetes with not taking his meds, chugging litres upon litres of pepsi and his diet was terrible- he lived off junk food.

My husband and I offered to get him into a private clinic and away from my parents. He said no. He told everyone in our family that the doctors didn't know what was wrong with him, except they did and told him exactly how to fix the problem. Yea he didn't do it.

Now where do my abusive fucked up parents come into this and the title of thos post. My parents hate doctors. Hate and I mean hate will never see 1. My brother learnt that from them and did the same unless I dragged his arse there because his issue was driving everyone insane because he would make everyone's hell about it. So my brother was found dead in his bed.

My siblings and I get the call saying hey your brother was found dead this morning by your mother. Ok wow. So my oldest brother races to the house after being MIA for a while as like the rest if us got out when we could. He calls me later and the very 1st thing he says is what the fuck happened in that house! Now I am the only sibling that actually has anything to do with the 3 abusive fuckers and its because hey I want to make sure they weren't killing themselves- well too late for that, so I explained what I knew. 1 thing was he had been very unwell for 2 days and not 1 of those idiots called an ambulance! 

You left your son to die and now wonder why he's dead!! Fuck me my parents were stupid!!

Stay for part  2 of this shit I am now dealing with because you find out what killed him and why I wanted to kill him myself!!"
"im not rlly a redditor so sorry if the formatting on this is weird..but like the title says, i need help. im 17 years old, soon to be 18. the entirety of my life, ive dealt with multiple kinds of abuse- physical, sexual, you name it. this also includes cosca (both incesteous and non incestuous) stalking/harassment, public humiliation (caused by my mother) and just a whole long list of things that ive dealth with for years upon years.im autistic and have been very self aware from a young age (i was also always alone because i was homeschooled) and i made the decision a long time ago that i wanna leave. my mother created a bank account with me (pnc specifically) but has withheld the account information from me, so im not able to log into my OWN account. i want to create a new bank account when i turn 18, because im leaving and i want her to have 0 access to me or my money...but how do i go about this exactly?? i have my own personal information such as my social security, the actual card itself, and my id- but i dont know if thatll be enough for pnc to let me close my account without her there. what if they say she has to be present for the account to be closed?? what do i do then? and how could i possibly create a new bank account if i cant close the old one :( pls anybody who has an answer, help me!! i want to get out of here! i have a plan but thats one of the big things that im worried about- i dont want her taking all the money ive saved up! 

tldr; my abusive mother has access to my bank account since im a minor. how do i close the account when im 18 without her being present?"
"Don't know if this is the right place to say this, but I have a really shitty experience to write about here

From age literally 0 to.. I'm guessing around 12-13 years old (really cannot remember how, or when it stopped) my parents, specially my mom abused (is what I would interpret it as, on paper) me and my sibling. Nah, not a few slaps in the face twice a year, mom had mental health issues and serious stress and I guess, ended up taking out most of it on my sibling and I in the form of excessive ""scolding"". Get pissed off at everything, beating up, throwing stacks of books on us, and just, you can guess the rest. A little scary part is that I only have fragments of vivid memories from this period of time. And my dad? From what I can remember never even once tried to stop his wife from beating his kids. Just watched, silently, with a blank look on his face - still remember that look, although I dont neccesarily feel anything about it. Just, ah right, okay, thats how it is. Not disappointed, just.. okay. Fast forward - years later, probably by the time I was 13-14 none of my parents really hit me or anything anymore. I don't remember feeling relieved, I wasn't even doubtful or scared in the first place, because that was all I ever knew from my house hold. I realised that my parents actually grew to be kind, thoughtful and supportive people. Fuck, I don't know how to explain this. My mom would express guilt and apology to us as we were KIDS, as if that meant anything to us - we didn't even recognise it as abuse back then. Now when sometimes that comes to topic, my mom plays victim by basically bringing up how mentally she was struggling that time. That's fine, I won't protest because I don't want to discuss this ever with her. But I can't help but find myself in a rare state - mad that my parentss abused my sibling and I. Not because it left me with a permanent emotional scar, not because it damaged a fundamental period of growth in my life as a person, But because right now they look so happy. My dad, and my mom, they're so happy and in love right now. and its not like that doesn't make me smile, but on the back of my head I think like, so you guys can just seem so genuinely happy after comitting such sin? Just don't understand the guilt mechanism here, like how do yall live w yourself bruh thats crazy. Mom's always a victim because of how much health issues she has, I get it. Let it be so- but, I sometimes want to let them know whatever ""hapiness"" they have right now is not deserved. I'd normally say, deep down, I just want to talk to my parents about it and get myself a proper apology (I think they would) and get it over with. But no, not really. I don't want to talk, I don't want an apology, I don't want no heart-felt reconcile thing, I will forgive but it's too late to forget. Their abuse shaped me into something I hate to be, and while I deal with that they get to enjoy the rest of their lives next to the love of their life. How unfair, how unjust but that's how I tell myself it is what it is."
I recently got in a fight with my brother and my mom. My mom and i were arguing and she was yelling at me for failing to redo a assignment which i got a 80 in. We were both shouting and my brother came up to hit me for shouting at my mom. This has happened once before but i really deserved ut back then. He told me to take off ny glasses to slap me but i resisted so he took it off forcefully and started slapping me. I got so angry that i kicked back. This really made my brother mad and he started  punching me in my head my face and my body. I want to remind you that he is 21 and im 13. My brother is really a hypocrite and is pretty much the house dissapointment. He started choking me and i look over at my mom and shes not even feeling sad but she looked mad at me. I have calmed down in my room and im debaing wethere i should ask my school for help or i really dont know what to do.
"So my girlfriend's mother is very abusive and I dont know what to do. Her dad knows about this but hardly does anything about it. Both of her parents are very strict and our relationship is secretive. Multiple times her mother has said that she ""wished her dead"" and she tried to drown her in a bathtub. My girlfriend also has a heart condition and it gives her pain along with asthma so her mom exploits that by making her do exercises at night. Up until 3 months ago this her mother was perfectly normal and loving and just overnight her mother became a whole different person. Her dad and brother doesnt help her at all. I dont know what to do, she insists that she has it handled and wont let me call CPS or the cops. She also doesnt seek any help with this or talk to her therapist. Please help, i dont know what to do and im afraid that her mom might seriously injure or even kill her."
"For some context, I'm an adult (29F) who hasn't lived with my abusive dad since I entered my 20s. However, I still have to see him every few months for the usual holidays and every time it just fills me with dread.

My dad is not a good person but someone who is incredibly good at putting on the front of being caring and compassionate when it works in his favor. He has self admitted to doing incredibly nasty and awful behaviors in-order to manipulate people so he can keep them in his life and abuse them (without using the words manipulate or abuse, of course) but acts like any of the same behaviors directed at me are just simple overreactions or misunderstandings, so I know he is a compulsive liar on top of that. He has mentally, physically, and sexually abused multiple people at this point, including minors, and at one point I was so scared of him that I sincerely thought he would kill me, so I moved out and never went back to living with him.

But despite all of that, I have now distanced myself from him greatly and only see him a handful of times a year and I just can't bring myself to cut him off. There's a few reasons I suspect for this like: him making life harder for siblings, him attempting to stalk me, him trying to make my divorced mother's life harder, him threatening to commit suicide, or even actually committing suicide. But in any other situation like this... I would still highly encourage someone and probably would have already left without looking back. Why is it so insanely hard to do this with parents? Especially abusive ones we know just absolutely suck as people? Why do I have to worry so much about him retaliating... it feels like I'm playing house with an abuser and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about, especially know everything he's done up to this point.

If anyone here has cut off a parent like this, any input would be so greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being stuck in this loop with him. I want him so badly out of my life but feel so mortified at the idea of actually removing him and don't have a clue how to do it as safely as possible. I don't even introduce my partner to this man because I don't want them to ever even speak to him."
"24, and sometimes feel as if I'm stuck in my 18 year old self. React to things the same way, depressive mood swings, no trust in anyone older than me.  I despise them beyond words, but every day I'm fed the same bullshit of ""they didn't starve you, and you had an education, why are you complaining?'
I'm this close to leaving everything behind and working at an oil rig or something, even if my health makes it life threatening."
" I was using my hot glue gun last night, whenever I leave it or just put it down it's ALWAYS on a plate, not carpet, or wood, or fabric, or paper. I have exams today and tomorrow, so I have to study. I remembered and I panicked because I had to study, and I left the glue gun plugged in ON A PLATE. I guess I forgot, but I have a vivid memory of unplugging it last night. This morning I'm woken up to ""Wake up. Is that fucking glue gun on?"" I answered no since I remember unplugging it. ""Yes you did. You fucking liar-snake."" I was rolled over, not facing him so I said ""But I remember unplugging it?"" He goes quite for a second, I hear him unplug the glue gun, and then he fucking presses the metal tip of it into my back for around 3 seconds. Now I have this really bad burn, and it hurts alot. I don't know if i'll be able to focus during exams now, since the slightest thing wrong with my body runs through my brain and distracts me. Plus he took my hot glue gun. Even though that's gonna be my source of income for collage. (Selling stuff I make for around 20-50 dollars)

I don't understand, is this my fault? Does anyone else's parent(s) do this? What do I do?"
"So this situation is currently in motion and is being worked on and the end is near as I’m typing this so I should start from the beginning I guess so me (17m) and my (16f) gf started dating in February of this year (currently 2024) but starting talking in December of 2023 and back then I asked about her parents and always heard very little about them when the parents conversation was brought up but when we started dating she really opened up to me about her situation and I should add that currently it’s not just her in danger but it’s also her little brother (11m) that is living with this but anyway I don’t know where to start with just her dad alone (49m) so in late February when we were like two weeks into dating we were gonna tell them and then they found out anyway and he wasn’t that mad but questioned me about it obviously and I explained to him what our situation was that we only just started dating and I would like to meet him and her mother and discuss all of this which we did and all was fine UNTIL she started telling me that they both have called her a whore a bitch a slut and words like that and I’ve heard this first hand and they both have put there hands on her multiple times including slapping her choking her and kicking her into her room most of this stuff happened around the ages 6-11 and still continues today occasionally but she mostly is being called slurs consistently  and here comes the more disgusting and sexual abuse/tendencies part of this cluster fuck so in mid to late April we had a pregnancy scare and we tried to hide it because we knew they would kill us both but they ended up finding out and her dad as we expected lost his mind he started trashing the house and as soon as he found out he put his hands around her throat and called whore as usual and then the worst part comes up after he did that he then made her sit down and tell him exactly how we had sex  what position we did it in how long it lasted and if she had a orgasm or not and In the past she has had a series of different encounters with him involving stuff that seems to be a sexual manner such as her taking a shower and him walking in and ripping the curtain open and looking her up and down for several minutes she asked him for privacy and he told her no and I don’t know if this is worth anything but in march at the time I was in Georgia (I live in Arizona) I was visiting my sister as she just moved out and me and my gf were talking and she texted me pictures of her and the whole family in car and his phone connected to the car and started playing double penatration porn not to mention as I said the little brother (11) was in the car but thats just a little fraction in this shitcicle but recently she was allowed to spend time over here at my house and she got a call from her dad asking her what time she was coming home and she said probably around 9:30PM and he started saying that he doesn’t know his daughter anymore and she’s always out of the house and she’s no longer allowed over there (there being my house) and needs to be home no later then 9:30 so then I took her home and a few hours go by and then MY dad gets a text from her dad that was along the lines of you people are taking my daughter away from me  and turning her against me and manipulating her and encouraging her to run away and then my mom got really really mad at this situation and called him and I should add my girlfriend tells me and my family everything she really trusts us but anyway my mom called him out on all of this she called him out on the threats to separate us and the calling his daughter a whore  which he admitted too and said she deserves it and the abuse in the past and he spoke in a calm tone through out all of it while my mom was screaming at him and after that my gf has been looking into emancipation because she has self harm scars from this situation and and she has openly admitted she can’t do it anymore and is considering suicide or running away but here where some hope shines in my dad at his work has met a person who specializes in foster care/emancipation for kids and is helping us through this entire situation and we have told him about most of the stuff going on and he really believes we have a case but it goes way deeper than just emotional/physical and possible sexual abuse he did a background check on her dad and found he is a former felon and has currently multiple different alias and has a confirmed name change but also but that’s not even the start of it



For some reason I had to add a pole idk why

"For the record, if you live with your parents, rent seems fair. You live in the house, you pay for part of its upkeep and supply. My problem is stated above, but on top of that, she permanently raised my rent because my week was a blur and I forgot to pay. She acts as if I'm living in a real apartment  and gets huffy if I question it. I've been paying her $550(was once $500) in ""rent"" and $70 to $100 for ""utilities"" since March-ish of last year. What set off my alarm bells was seeing our electric and water bills and realizing my near-$600 could cover at least part of those bills. Also, our house itself is fully paid off. I hope I'm just being over-sensitive, but the whole thing feels fucky."
"When I was a kid, my dad used to abuse me alot. He was very strict on my education. Everytime I would make a small mistake he would threaten to ""break my bones"" by punching me so hard. As I grew older, he became worse. When I was 15,  I was so close to calling the cops on my dad since he was also hitting my mom. But I ended up not doing it becuz my mom would scare me about foster care and I did not want to be separated from my siblings. She even said that if we ever go to court, she will lie for my father and protect his identity. It made me so mad. After all these years my dad has gotten better. He had some character development. I am 20 now and I still have to live with my parents. The problem is my trauma is catching up to me and affecting me in my daily life. I always think I dont feel safe at home. I freeze up if my dad asks me something and I refuse to go to the living room if hes there. How do I get better? "
"I was taking out my kids friends for a fun afternoon (park, ice cream parlor) and when it came time to drop off said friend she refused to leave the car and insisted on coming home with us. I do know child comes from a home with issues but I never heard of a little kid not wanting to go home after a long tiring day.  The abusive must be so extreme she is terrified to go home. Eventually she agreed to leave the car after promised a bribe by a sibling.
What do I do? My mama heart is so sad for this little girl. "
"This happened on Father's Day this Sunday and I only got my phone back to talk about it. Anyways my little sistes hate me, so they try anything to get me in trouble. On Father's day I snapped at them for something, and then they went to tell my parents, but then my mom decided to escalate it, bringing up things from like 2+ years ago to prove that I'm a bad child. to My dad has a short temper, so he got mad and screamed at me and started to chase me down, he then pushed me down stairs and screamed that he's going to kill me over and over, I was curled up into a ball at the bottom of the stairs, crying saying if he wants to kill me, do it. My mom and grandma was trying to protect me, my mom was acting like an angel as if she didn't instigate the whole thing, she does this Everytime. He was hitting me so hard, that my mom made me run into he basement and lock the door. After everything cooled down, my mom comes into the basement asking me in a rude tone for my phone, saying I'm a bad child, and that my dad works 2 jobs for all my foolishness. Afterwards she kept on saying I'm bipolar and should go to an asylum. I hate this soo much, everyone blames me. And it was worse because when my dad was saying he wanted to kill me while I curled up, my little sisters were laughing and pointing. Now they keep on bringing up, mocking me. Sorry if this is worded wrong, my head still kinda hurts "
I'm panicking and want to talk to some pls

"to start- after what happened between us and the the type of person my mom is, it makes sense for her to get it covered up. i've recently come to terms that my mom is not my mom anymore. and as much as i should not give a fuck, i feel my inner child sobbing. 

to summon up our conflict, my mom was in an abusive relationship for 16 ongoing years. me and my three younger sisters had to witness and endure my stepdad's(younger sisters' father)abuse. when i got to an age where i was aware of what was going on and how wrong it was, i started standing up for my mom, my sisters and myself. long story short, my mom didnt like that and we spent the last four years on and off. 

during that time, my mom went actually crazy and instead of protecting us, became another abuser. she was my first fight(we've had four PHYSICAL fights). i've reported her three times to DCFS and the first two social workers absolutely horrid.

after my mom had fought my at the time, FIFTEEN year old sister as a FORTY FIVE year old grown ass woman, i called again with a verrrrry small sliver of hope and we hit the fucking jackpot. our social worker believed us and supported us with so much care. my grandparents now have temporary custody of my three younger sisters and my mom and my sisters' dad have scheduled and monitored meeting and talking times. 

it would take way too long for me to get into the detail of the abuse and the effects of it today. im just giving some background of why im here rn, ik that some may not believe me or see me as a spoiled ungrateful kid. i have to find the time and mindfulness to unpack those memories. im gone and keep yapping too much so im just going to say: believe me or not, i know what i went through. 

damn after all that i lowkey feel better lol. but ik im still gonna feel hurt over it. i dont want to just think abt the bad times to feel better, but to acknowledge and work on healing that part of myself. because im getting older, i want to grow and heal from the past and move forward in a different light. 

i just want to ask those who have been in similar situations: what are some ways you've helped heal your inner child?

"I could never punch a 4 year old
I could never call one stupid 
I could never cause the harm, trauma, and abuse you did. 

30 years old now - you told me I’d understand when I was older. I still don’t. "
"No. Everything wasn't ok at home. My attendance at school started getting bad. Teachers noticed. 
I was acting sadly at school even tho I tried not to. Counselor noticed. I was struggling with depression the pediatrician noticed. My mom denied it all. Denied anything was wrong. 


I was beaten ( ""punished"") for telling the Counselor the truth. 
I have no where to write this stuff. I have a therapist but it's not the same as writing.  It's not the same way of getting things out.

I am now 40 years old and behind in life. 
Possibly because all this. It's really tucked with my head. I've got this kick ass bf I don't want to lose. I hope my past doesn't ruin my future. 



Why though? Why is it so hard to say I was done wrong? And why do I have to feel guilty for it? "
"Mom: do you want dhr to take you away??!?!
Me:( only allowed to silently think inside my head) silently said to myself-why yes. Yes. I do. "
"The abuse has been more emotional for a while. More manipulating and my parents playing the victim.

It usually happens during arguments, which I have so much trouble with. I've been told, ""Stand up for yourself, don't let them manipulate you!"" But standing up for myself only leads to more trouble. 

My mom usually asks, ""How are my actions bad/how do they effect you?"" Sarcastically. And it frustrates me so much, because:

1- She's only going to deny that she did any of it/that it hurt me in any way (which, yeah, because you know EXACTLY what hurts me and what doesnt.)

2- How are you gonna treat someone bad and then act oblivious to what *you* did?

Anyways, im not sure if I should stand up for myself and make a *billionth* attempt to express how mentally damaging this all is for me, or just do what im doing now,  let them yell at me while just silently standing there. 

It just seems like theres no point. They never listen. But ""stand up for yourself"" is the only advice i ever get. "
I need someone to talk to 
"hear me out, i love this woman, but i can't stand her anymore. i love her for all the sacrifices she has made for me, i love her for paying for my education even when it wasn't easy for her. i appreciate every single thing she has done for me to get me to where I am today. what i don't understand is, why she thinks its okay for her to remind me of all she has done every time she does something wrong and i call her out for it. i had a very shitty childhood. her and my dad got divorced, got back together, and then got divorced again. every time i have an argument with her, she blames the divorce on me even though i had nothing to do with it. i'm 21 right now, i have developed severe social anxiety and often times i sink deep into really depressive thoughts because her and my dad dragged me into their fights ever since i was 8 or something. i saw everything, and i mean, EVERYTHING. things you shouldnt show a child even on a screen. they made me watch it, that shit traumatized me, i sometimes even had panic attacks cause i worried about them fighting so much that it made me feel sick. ofcourse it would've had some sort of lasting impact on me, its only natural. but now, she calls me names for just, simply being upset over something. she'll say things like ""she can't enjoy anything herself, so she wants to ruin it for others too"". ""look at her, its impossible for her to be happy"". they ruined annual holidays for me, cause the only memories I have from those holidays are of them fighting and screaming while the rest of my family celebrated downstairs but I was forced to sit and watch. no shit I'm depressed now, but I'm doing everything I can. I work a job I hate so i can help her with bills, but she doesn't see any of my efforts. idk why she does this to me.. its so exhausting, im sick of forgiving her over and over and over. i have tried every recipe in the book. i have tried talking to her, in all manners possible. its impossible for my words to reach her, no matter how many times i say them. she knows exactly what to say to me to hurt me, such as telling me that I ended up just like my father. i know its not black and white and shes not a bad person, but this one aspect of her is killing me every day, and idk how much longer I can hold on. i have never cared about what people say, but when something like this comes from your own mother, it hits different. she should be the one to understand why i turned out the way i did, better than anyone. the worst part is, everytime something like this happened, everytime she fought with my father, my brother ran away, and only came back when things calmed down. he always avoided everything while i was forced to make sure nothing escalated. naturally, he turned out confident, social and mixes well with people while I'm the opposite, which again, is something i get blamed for by my mother. a few days ago she told me how she's so glad that my brother didn't end up being damaged goods like his sister, that she's so glad she protected him, as if i wasn't worth protecting. when i asked her this, she said ""well its just your luck that you were born first, and a girl, its different for girls"" ??????????????????? idk anymore, i really dont, i feel like there's no point in anything, no point in trying, no point in holding on. i just want to kill myself so I don't have to deal with her words anymore. its not just her, my dad has a cycle of abuse as well, but there's only so much info I can fit into one post so for now i'll leave it. 



i can't afford therapy right now, and i don't have any friends who i can talk to, or any other figure in my life. this is why i'm posting this here, i'm sure many of the things people might suggest are things i've already done, but i just wanted to let this out in the world."
"I (36F high masking ASD) have a mother 75F who constantly verbally and emotionally abused my father 91F, silencing him, talking under his hearing level (he is mostly deaf), and basically everyone was treading on eggshells my entire childhood.  She also had a repetitive dialogue about the burden of men, that they never helpful and are useless and stupid, this affected my brother a lot. I clashed with her in my teens, but am aware that I (before and after adolescence) have learned to people please, keep the peace and try to be liked by everyone so I have social currency to change the atmosphere. Now in my own relationships I see the same behaviours and temper come out in me, I feel rage, resentment, loneliness and despair in my current relationship. He’s a great guy 36M, I’ve never been in love like this, and he is almost too patient… but he doesn’t work, he’s insecure and a little immature, and after 6 months of great mutual support I started to find myself belittling him, being quick to anger, snapping, not wanting to be touched/intimate and feeling frustrated. Its now a year in, it’s been getting worse and yesterday I asked him if he was falling out of love with me and he said he was scared of me. That shame really hit me hard, I’ve been pretty shut down since, suicidal thoughts at the forefront. He’s walking on eggshells and it broke me, my previous pattern and strong urge now is to break up with him to stop exposing ‘evil’ self to people and accept I can’t in good conscience let anyone get close to me. I’ve had a good amount of therapy, but I’m still not healed, I’m still repeating my mothers behaviour and I guess I’m hear to ask if there’s hope for me, or should I just give up on relationships altogether. 
Has anyone else had this experience, is there hope for me to manage this? Should I just leave to spare him?"

"i'm 21 years old and i'm supposed to have graduated college but the thing is i was burnt out from high school and i kept failing all my exams, so i dropped out, and so my parents sent me to therapy and put me on medication but the thing is the medication doesn't fucking work if i'm stuck with them reminding me that i'm a failure for not graduating on time and that i'm the disappointment for being mentally ill and they never let me choose anything and they never accommodate my needs. is it really worth it to go on living like this or is there any hope at all?"
"it has been 2 years since i've lived with him full time and over a year since ive lived in a different city, im 21 now, but the way my adoptive dad (who i will b calling my step dad cuz i am uncomfortable calling him dad) has treated me in my teenage years still haunts me and causes me to be very short tempered with him, and has given me very unhealthy reactions to things, my biggest problem is he doesn't think he has ever done anything wrong enough to constitute an apology, i talked to him a little over a year ago and i said i was waiting for him to apologize for how he treated me when i was 14 -18 and he basically said he has nothing to be sorry for and while he has changed a lot in the last few years i don't rlly believe the progress has been enough to warrant me changing my views on him, for context he was raised super religious/strict, and is a bit of an unspoken alcoholic, and i was super addicted to weed and partied a fair amount in my teen years and i was angry, after he divorced my mom when i was 13 our relationship entirely changed, mostly because i saw how horrible verbally abusive and controlling he was to my mom and becuase i was a little shit, i definetly put up challenges and argued and was angry for reasons that were not my own, but the way his anger towards grew until i couldn't say a single thing without him assuming i meant it in a way to hurt and offend him, i remember so many instances where an offhand comment from me turned into him yelling and waving his hands above his head with me just trying not to react, and as i got older it just got worse, to hitting the walls or the steering wheel, driving eraticly out of anger, full on screaming like an animal, sometimes dropping to his knees and hitting his head (not hard enough to cause injury i think) and once throwing a chair across the room , all over arguments i don't even remember the subject off , and now he expects me to be a responsible grown up and respect him as if i don't start to sweat the moment anyone i love raises the voice or changed their tone, my mother was horribly abused as a child and sees my step dads actions as bad and immoral and unfair but not abusive and continues to encourage me to see him and mend a relationship but i don't think i can do it anymore, i went to see him father's day becuase i was in town and it was the same shit , acting like i have no right to my own opinion , lying to get his way about small things, i am tired of this but i also feel so much pity for this man with no one left , other then my little sister , his blood daughter and they get along wonderfully, which is definitely another confusing point for me, basically i want to know if you think i have a right to feel this way, if this sounds like abuse, because it's not like i didn't get harsh and bitter towards the end but i was a teenager probably on some drugs most of the time and he was a grown man , i am just so unsure how to go forward, i have tried demanding apologies but all i get is the same scoff and eye rolling and im tired of it but i don't want to call him abusive over things that happened years ago "
"It's always my fault, nothing I do is right. According to my family...

Me being bullied, my fault. Me being depressed and in a dark place, probably because I didn't do enough work. Me being sexually assaulted as a toddler, I probably encouraged the adult who did it. Me losing all my stuff, my dog, my money by my super abusive mother, I was clearly to privileged in my shitty apartment I can't even afford. 


No mater what I do, it always seems to be right for them. I'm always a disappointment to my family, but I don't have ANYONE else to turn to. Every one has abandoned me. I have nothing in life anymore, my parents took everything. I have no hope anymore "
"I've posted about this a LOT across various different subreddits, but I wanna go into more of the specifics in case anybody has any advice that could be helpful for me.  

I won't go into my mom's abusive specifically, or at least I'll try not too, but living here is horrible. She actively tries to sabotage friendships, my relationship, jobs, ways for me to leave, and more in probably not mentioning. I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack whenever I'm in the same room as her (my mom noticing my fear will cause me to be yelled at).  I've been looking desperately for any possible ways for me to escape this place (or for any way for me to secure housing if I get kicked out) and I... Really don't have many options.

I don't have the grades or money for college, I don't have a driver's license, I don't have a car, all of my devices EXCEPT for this backup phone were taken away, I don't have any family or friends I can live with when I leave, and we live in a VERY bad area in terms of rent/job opportunities. Cheap, shitty apartments are around a thousand, and I found ONE studio that's around 800 bucks, but it's in a very car dependent area, so that probably won't work.

I'm at a fucking loss. I BARELY understand what taxes are and how to do them, and I'm generally just not prepared for adult life. But I cannot live her any longer, I just fucking can't. Life is so scary and horrifying with my mom around, and if she finds out about this phone, I'm FUCKED.  

After hours of using AI to calculate prices, budgets, and other things that I understand very little of, as WELL as obsessively researching different towns and states to see where had decent rent prices, I actually found something promising. There's a town in my state that's not only VERY walkable, but also has somewhat decent rent prices. So honestly, my current plan is to just try to find a way to get there, and then find a cheap studio to live in.  Problem is, I don't have a car, and I don't even have a months worth of rent saved, and my mom probably won't allow me to get a job. She fucking loathes me, but is also TERRIFIED of me abandoning her (not to stigmatize cluster B stuff as ""the SPOOKY ABUSER DISORDER ooOOooOoh"", but I'm absolutely convinced she has borderline and narcissism).  

I'm planning to ask any classmates I can if they're looking for a temporary roommate when my senior year rolls around in a few months, but I'll probably be fresh out of luck. I'm autistic, and socializing is VERY hard for me. As well as that, due to somebody there sharing extremely personal information about me out of spite, a lot of people know about my old self harm habits, as well as other deeply uncomfortable things. They're kind of the ring-leader of the ""LGBT-group"" at my school, and because of that, I'm CONSTANTLY misgendered and dead named, even by OTHER fellow trans people. It feels so fucking awful, and basically no groups at my school will accept me due to us living in a very right wing area.  

I've considered just asking online on trans/autistic communities if anybody nearby is in need of a roommate but... First of all, safety lol. And secondly, I don't really know how. Most of these communities would probably remove my messages or outright ban me out of fear of me being a predator, and I doubt somebody who WOULD be looking for a roommate would settle for somebody who would have to be driven everywhere, as well as someone who probably wouldn't be able to pay rent for at least a month so they can job-hunt. Every day that passes, the risk of homelessness just gets scarier and scarier. I try to sound cool and composed while typing out a lot of these messages, but I'm... Really fucking scared.   

If anybody has any advice, or any OTHER communities that I could probably reach out to, please don't hesitate. Thanks for reading."
"(male 16 currently) I've been abused from the age of 7-16 both sexually / physically and mentally I've been consistently Rworded by people I don't know I've had my body seen by and touched by over 100+ people I've tried to leave this planet 3 times now and have been caught every time. 

At the age of 12, I had my first try at leaving this world by measures of hanging (this was the context of the story) my father pulled the rope away from my neck and brutally beat me he pulled out his unregistered firearm and proceeded to pistol whip me in the face 4 times then turns it on himself and proceed to aim it at himself (he was pretending to shoot himself) he puts the weapon back in his waistband and decided to violently have his way with me as he catches a glimpse of a tear streaming down my face me said “don't cry or ill give you something to cry about” (he has said this a lot of times before) then he decided to beat me until I stopped crying (he still had his junk out this whole time) he resumed his fun with me and proceeded to rip a chunk of my hair out (he was sexually assaulting me while he did it) he used me two times then left to go to work (he's a bodyguard 6’5 and pretty large has also served in the forces for 4 years) this event had happened again when I tried when I was 13.

(this is another story) me 15 I have a little brother now and must protect him with my life kind of mentality he's probably 1-2 at the time of the incident. My brother had spilt a drink over and my father was going to beat him badly I snatched him before and locked him in my room and I took the beating (he didn't hold back at all) he beat me with the dull side of a knife for about 10-12 minutes straight then proceeded to go get his taser and said If I scream or even cry he’ll kill me and nobody will ever find my body after the beating he stripped me and took me to a shopping centre and left me there naked and he told me I wasn't allowed home till he said so (I was on the street for 2 days) I was sexually assaulted for the day then thrown out in the middle of nowhere (4 hours away by car I was still naked btw) took me a long time to get home because it was night when I made it home and I quote my dad said this “where were you? We all missed you, didn't try to leave this world again did ya” this was around my breaking point.

I couldn't tell anyone because nobody would believe me because “boys don't get Rworded” i just wanted some comfort this is one of the not so bad stories (if my engilsh is bad it is because I’m self taught I have many other stories if you want to know about them just ask me<3"
"Hello! I'm 16 currently and I've sort of come to the realization that my parents are not behaving like how my friends parents act towards them and with each so please tell me if there's something wrong with me or with my parents 

OK so I'll start of by saying that my parents never and I mean NEVER got along honestly my sister asked them to get divorced but they refused because of how society may view them if that happens so due to this whenever My parents even sit together they fight their so sick of each other that they don't even wanna look at each other faces me and my siblings tried our best to maybe mend their relationship or make them atleast friends or stand each other for our family sake but they hold grudges against each other and they don't wants to forgive each other my dad (in the past) would go out for weeks and not return home whenever he fought with mom all I remember is me calling him messaging him and even recording videos and sending it to him begging him to come back he always did because he loved us but he hated my mom he would trow food down on the floor and trow all of her stuff out of their room etc my mom would never react to that and simply go somewhere else which was good so their fights never got bad to the point of my dad physically hurting her my mom tried her best by always trying to make dad happy to the point where she stopped paying any attention to us she was also working but then something rightfully snapped in her and she stopped trying to please him and rightfully fight back I always felt like I was walking on thin ice whenever I talked about dad around her (my dad moved to the upper side of the house but he was still living in the same house as mom at this point) and even when I tried to talk to her about a different subject she would always round it back and say ' your dad did this or that ' she would basically trama dump on us kids I love my mom but honestly I was a kid I didn't want to see my dad in a bad light I know he didn't love mom but he loved us so for our sake he tried to be more nicer to mom and change his way like leaving for weeks etc honestly he still hasent changed much but he's trying but at this point in time it was to late and my mom didint forgive him so my dad gave up as well and now both of them live in the same house pretending as if eachother don't exist so this is the back story for my parents and the possible reason they might be abusive but their behavior towards us is what I want u guys to evaluate for example my mom hitting and shoving us and screaming at us if we get in a argument with her and my dad is always saying to our relatives how toxic our house is which annoys my mom even more and he knows it also he keeps saying we are ungrateful and we don't love him etc etc when he's the one paying the bills and he also used to trow stuff like food my mom made near us and would vanish for weeks my mom keeps bringing and blaming my dad for everything whenever we argue with her like ""your dad didn't raise you right that's why your this way "" etc "

"Hi. I am a 23 year old male living in Australia. For the past 9 years or so, my father (who I live with) has been emotionally abusive. It started in 2015, when he blamed my mother for screwing up in raising us and threatened to take us all away and make us live with him (he was living in another state for work). From that point on, he became an incredibly volatile individual, and at one point, he threatened to throw a key at my mother's face because she told him that he was being reckless when pressuring us to cross the road in dangerous traffic.

He apologised the following day, but he still continued to be threatening at times, and one time physically threatened my sister because she was too obsessed with her phone. Just a week or so ago, he unleashed a barrage of verbal abuse at my brother (who struggles with depression), saying that he's pretty much worthless, has no job, and saying that when he looks at his brother, he is reminded of his failure as a father. He also shamed my brother for quitting his medical course and flying back to Australia - which my brother did because he had PTSD from contracting COVID and almost dying in Poland.

I've battled with depression for numerous years, and it's now reached a point where I feel absolutely suicidal. I want to get as far away as possible from my father, but I live with him, and have no means of financially supporting myself. I also don't want to abandon the rest of my family, including my brother, at such a tough time. I am also fearing retaliation from my father. But I simply feel I can no longer do this."

"Hello. This is my first time actually being able to reach out for help about this. I am 21 years old and my brother is 19 and we're pretty much being held hostage by our foster mom. We originally got placed with her in 2016 because my siblings and I were physically and mentally abused for years and even starved as punishment at our past home with my aunt and her boyfriend. I was also molested and raped by my aunts boyfriend and a dew of his male and female friends multiple times. We are genuinely thankful for everything our foster mom has done for us, without a doubt. But she is crazy, manipulative, and a narcissist. I know it sounds weird when I mention our ages. Any normal person would think ""dude youre 21! Just leave bro!"" But it's really not that simple. She holds every single possible advantage over us. She has our birth certificates and refuses to give them to us and we have no clue where she has them. We recently graduated high school this past month and she's actively avoiding going and getting it because she knows no matter what, we can't go. We don't have jobs, vehicles, money, or any way to get there whatsoever. We have no other family, we have no friends, we have no one but her. All she cares about is cleaning and that's it. It seems that she wants us to stay here ONLY to clean. I believe she's also scared of being lonely. Because she cheated on her girlfriend and she left. Her girlfriend was I'm our lives since 2011 and was pretty much a second mother to us. She was the balance that this household needed. And she left back in February 2023 and it's been living hell since. My stepmother doesn't care about anything but cleaning. She has no care for our physical, or mental well being. I'm not asking to be catered to like a baby, but at least give us our basic needs. Her only focus is cleaning. Her entire mood for the rest of the day depends on how good the house was cleaned from top to bottom. And note, we have 5 dogs that are barely trained. No one wanted these dogs but her and she doesn't want to take care of them, so we're forced to. Also her soon who is 26 years old also lives here and we are pretty much his servants. He doesn't have to do anything, not even things for himself. I'm surprised he can wipe his own ass. That's just how it's always been with him. When we first moved here we were told ""he doesnt have any chores because i want him to be a kid for a little bit longer."" He was around 18 at the time. And we were all under 13 cleaning the house top to bottom every single day. Cleaning has shifted from a common chore to our life amd it seems that's the way she wants it. And if it's not done to her standard (she has extreme OCD) she will spit threats at us left and right. She threatens to kick us to the curb, and she mentions about how she wishes she never brought us here, and that we don't work and that we're lazy BECAUSE we don't work. Mind, she won't let us. She refuses any sort of conversation about us getting jobs. It has turned to full blown arguments because of how bad she doesn't want us to work. She acts the way she does because she knows for a fact that if my dad was still around, he wouldn't allow it. He passed in 2019 after being in the hospital paralyzed from the waist down since 2008. He did everything he possibly could for us, genuinely a great man and we miss him so much that it hurts. She also blames us for his death. She has said to us countless times that it's our fault. Alo our mother isn't really in the picture, she surrendered us to our aunt back in 2009 because she simple could not afford to support us because she had just lost her job, and the house we were living in was too expensive for her because she work at walmart as a cake decorator or something like that. She did everything we could and I applaud her for that because I can't even imagine how hard that must've been. So we are stuck with our stepmom, unfortunately. I've been pretty much begging her to help us get our social security cards and high school diplomas so we can get jobs and be able to support ourselves, but she is doing everything in her power to make it not happen. We have nothing, we have no one, and she knows that and takes advantage of it. We feel like we have no way out so much to the point to where we have discussed suicide together, me and my brother. I'm just so sick and tired of living in constant fear of losing everything because of this crazy woman. And it hurts even more seeing the complete void of sadness in my brothers eyes. No one deserves this, not even my worst enemy. We are at our breaking points, and we cant take this much longer. There's so many more things I can mention but I feel like just rambling at this point. So if anyone is reading this, please, I'm begging you. Help us in any way possible. I'm not asking for a pity party or money, but any sort of way that we can leave this place in one piece. It will be extremely appreciated because we feel like we have no escape so this is our final resort.

"One of my best friends (30f) is trying to cut off her abusive parents, sister and aunt basically her whole living immediate family.

The short version 

Her mom is on her mortgage and phone plan. She lives in the same condo community as her aunt.

Me and my wife previously had to file a police report after her aunt wouldn't stop harassing my wife over my friend living with us. They pushed her to buy a condo she couldn't afford with her mom also on the mortgage (she doesn't live there though). Now they want her to spend money on her sister's wedding that she doesn't have

I am seriously worried about her if anyone has gone through this would you be able to share what you did"
"I’m 27 year old female based in India, from somewhat traditional indian household and from backward caste where ladies in the family does not have much say about things. But my upbringing has not been that way, i have always been taught that One should do as they please but being under a limited boundaries. I was child and didn’t know what is happening and always confused my mother’s behaviour towards me but later on i started believing that this is what mother’s love is. but now since my teenage years i have been understanding that my mother has tortured me a lot as a child. She has abused me mentally and that has affected a lot on my personality and commitment issues, along with anxiety. And mentally it took me so long to think logically about this entire scene. I was just 10 years old when i thought of ending my life and wrote a letter about the same because i could not take anymore of my mother’s behaviour towards me and her manipulative and controlling nature was too much for me to understand or handle. But i always thought i could trust my father, turned out i cannot trust him either. I told my father about my wish to marry my long term boyfriend about 4 years ago and at that time my father agreed and asked me to not to tell my mother regarding that, now after 4 years when i asked my father about my wish to marry my boyfriend and being official in-front of entire family he has rejected the proposal and went to my boyfriend’s house and asked his parents to not to let my boyfriend meet anymore and to have this relationship anymore. All this because my boyfriend’s family could not provide him 2 crore rupees which my dad asked in return for my marriage with him. And now he is saying that your boyfriend could not afford the money so i cannot help you anymore and you(I) should do as per I say, which is not making any scene and marry the boy i choose for you from the same community and same caste!!! Moral of the story is my mother is manipulative women who only thinks of her self and when i try to confront her about the same she never once accepted nor actually ever loved me like her daughter and my father is a person who wanted 2 crore rupees from his daughter’s boyfriend and his family so that he can have some money. I am now so much frustrated with people and i want to cut all my ties with them, can someone actually share some advice what can be done in such case?"
"My dad has always been mentally abusive and controlling, and lately I haven't called him because I hate the way he makes me feel, scared, afraid he'll lash out. I just called him for father's day and he sounded so sad, so broken I haven't called in so long and I feel guilty. What should I do?"

"hi, my mom is a drunk. And when I say drunk I mean a gallon of vodka a week (ive calculated). There are plenty of colorful words id like to use to describe her, but you can get the picture based of that. im 18, turning 19 at the end of the month. She used to hit me when I was 14, but only when her drinking gets REALLY bad does she get violent, she usually is just mentally abusive. But anyways, here's what happened:

My bf (19m) and I have been together sense I was 14, he is my rock. He was over the other night and we both worked that day so we had little energy so we just watched Ratatouille and talked for a little while. That's it. He left around midnight, and I was back in my room playing with my cat (1am now). We play this game (that im sure most cat owners do as well), where she's on one side of the door and im on the other, making a string, or pencil pop out and she try to get it. There was no tv or music on, the only noise in the whole house was me talking to my cat. My mom is texting me that ""He needs to leave now."" and a bunch of none sense, (my phone was charging on my bed so I didn't see the text). She then start spam calling me calling me a whore and saying she can hear us (having sex) and that im disgusting (she's been calling me a whore sense before I held a boys hand), I (obviously) get defensive and FaceTime her trying to show her its  just  my cat and I, but she refuses to pick up the call. I tell her to look in the drive way and his car isn't there. BECAUSE HE WASNT. Whatever. I text my boyfriend about it and we had a little laugh of her drunken delusions.

I go to bed and forget anything happen, because nothing really did happen. The next day I do my typical activities and get back home around 4:30. I start to cook my dinner and my step dad starts lecturing me that my boyfriend can't stay that late and I ""really pissed of my mom"" (he has stayed that late and later for years now). I got so mad. Usually I just roll my eyes but her lies and just making me so mad. I tell him what really happened and he said ""I don't want to get involved.""

My mom works from home sense covid when her company made the switch, so at 5pm she came out of her office and I was chopping up veggies for my dinner. She immitaley starts screaming at me calling me a slut, whore, easy blah blah blah (don't think it matters but he's the only person ive been with and we've  been dating sense we were fucking kids.) This makes me so fucking mad because she cheated on my step dad (same dude from above) with a married man and she dresses like a lady of the streets. We start arguing and I don't know why I usually don't feed into it but ut made me so mad. Long story short, my (very short) mom got on her tippy toes to slap me.

I grabbed my stuff and went to my boyfriends house, who's mom offered me a place to stay. Ive stayed with them before (my mom hit a family of 6 and totaled her car when driving to her boyfriends house and loss her license because she was drunk).

I know a slap isn't that bad but it opens the door to much worse. When she first slapped me during her last relapse, it got worse after.

My boyfriend and I plan on moving out this may when I finish my assocites (im at a community college because im trying to save money) but I feel so useless and helpless right now. I am the perfect child any parent would be so proud of me. Im a straight A nursing student, I work 25-30 hours a week, I volunteer and an animal shelter, ive never been to a party, I don't drink or smoke NOTHING. but im never good enough to be left alone.

This argument stuck with me, they usually don't. Im having a hard time doing my school work (taking summer classes to finish sooner), im crying over this drunk again like im a child and I don't have enough energy to see my friends anymore. Im breaking and this situation is my last straw.

I could stay with my boyfriend and his mom (who I love so much), I could stay with my dad (lives 2 hours away), or a could try something else temparly? Please give me suggestions and advice.

(Im sorry if I spelled some words wrong or it doesn't make that much sense in some areas, im distraught right now and don't really care to re-read it)"
"Sorta NSFW, barely. Graffiti mentioned.

My mother's ""celebration of life"" (I had it put together for her siblings) was held in a pavilion at a park last weekend. She'd died in February and was cremated. So we set up the memorial on a table by the wall of the pavilion, with picture boards, her degrees and diplomas, yadda yadda. A while later, I noticed there was some graffiti I'd missed when setting it up: a giant dick drawn in black on a dark brown surface (kinda hard to see). Hairy balls and all. It was absolutely the perfect scenario... any pictures of her memorial will have that in it. Whoever the immature jackass happens to be, I love you for it."
"I finally stood up to my mother after about 21 years of dealing with her abusive shit. I won’t go into specifics but she’s an awful mother but according to her I’ve rewritten the narrative and I’m the awful one. I think I’ll be disowned from my family for finally standing my ground. But I couldn’t take the constant micro aggressions and the love bombing and the manipulation. It’s funny because she said she’d always love and accept me for who I am but she has never done that once and now I think I’ve gone too far. But she has hated who I’ve become and who I love. I had to say something because I knew I couldn’t live with myself if I tried to keep the peace forever. It really hurts because my dad and my brother are innocent and have been abused by her too. I really don’t think I can repair the damage I caused and honestly I’m a little relived I’ve finally been disowned. While I’m not proud of my outburst, she needed to be put in her place, maybe she’ll finally examine how she hurts and manipulates everyone around her. "
"My parents are extremely dirty and filthy people and they are major hoarders. I’ve spent all my life trying to clean up their messes. They leave all their crap everything, many rooms are filled to the brim with their crap. I’ve fought with them so many times telling them to get rid of their shit or just put it away but they don’t give a fuck. I’ve even tried to speak to them calmly about how their mess affects me mentally, but they still do not change. There is no routine cleaning of any areas of the house. To protect my mental sanity I just hole up in my room and rarely come downstairs or interact with them.

They only ever clear stuff up when guests come and they demand that I clean up with them. It frustrates me so much because there have been many time where I will make the house look spotless but they will bring their shit and crap all over the house again and it’s a mess once more. Nothing can be maintained, they are so so comfortable living in a filthy environment. Because of this I have stopped cleaning the house because if they cannot respect themselves and our family enough to keep it clean, then why should I? I don’t have to share any spaces with them, I am fine staying in my room. 

We are middle class and my parents constantly bring home dozens of items from food pantries and we literally have no use or space for these items. They will literally eat moldy food and just scoop out the moldy part and eat the rest of the moldy food. They leave open food out everywhere. We have had several cockroach and mice infestations and I’ve had to beg and scream for us to get pest control treatments. They refuse to continue because they think it’s no major deal having vermin. Our drawers and cabinets in the kitchen and living room are constantly filled with mice poop. Once we had a whole bag of rice that was torn apart by mice and it was filled with mice poop. My parents proceeded to handpick the mouse poop out, wash the rice several times, cook it and serve it to us. I was in absolute shock. Last week I saw a mouse in our DISH RACK. Who knows where these mice get into, they could be crawling over our clean dishes! 

I resort to my bed room and buy and eat packaged food or take out. I despise them and their filth and refuse to help them clean when guests come over, and they will try to emotionally abuse me and even try to hit me if I don’t help them. My mom claims that even if there is crap everywhere that I should still vacuum, dust, and sweep. I don’t even spend any time downstairs, so I don’t even feel obligated to clean there. If they do not respect their children to keep the house clean for them, then why should I clean up for their guests? Plus it feels pointless to me because vacuuming the floor isn’t suddenly going to make the room look spotless. I can clean the fridge but I can’t throw away any old food. I can wipe down all surfaces but there are still doing to be random condiments, bottles, and crap all over the countertops. So what is the point?

Am I in the wrong? Is my response valid? I have currently locked myself into my bedroom because my dad was being physically aggressive and violent. Who the fuck would want to clean your dirty fucking house when you try to intimidate them into doing it."
"is it possible that when a narcissistic parents doesn't like their children, they want them to die? I actually feel with confidence, that my own father want me to die with starvation. He's a mama's boy and he also doesn't have a good childhood but idk what her mother did, because they were just in luck of fortune when it comes to money. Her mother is good at spells and lucks. But I'm not really closed to her. About my dad, he has a lot of money, he could afford therapy for me if he would. But he won't do it because he said he doesn't want to go to jail. which is absolutely the most absurd thing i've ever heard. And so he actually admitted that he's neglecting me. I got distanced to him, and he got distanced to me even more. Eventually, he doesn't really talk about something emotional. He'd end the phone call and tell me he's doing something and he'd call me later. As an excuse. This is so hard to open up with people because even my own family, Mom's side treats me like a black sheep because i chose to do the emotional work. Idk about my fathers side. I'm young only 16.

I feel like my dad just wants me to be depressed and kill myself.





⬇️p.s u don't have to read this, just some details

( Idk what he's doing. He has 2 cars he lives in USA. And he says he's gonna take me to US and live with him, I'm currently on another country with my mom's, they're divorce when I was 3. And about that, i've been waitibg for 6 years to approve my visa, and now i'm 16 but he said it was not approved yet. He showed me when i was 13 on a video call, there's a room for me when i'll live with him. Maybe one thing that hesitated him is he knows I prefer to do the emotional work and one thing that my dad hate is emotions. Bc what could've been happen in 6 years?? )"
"I am a 16yr old girl who is in a relationship and is planning to pursue psychology for my bachelors next year. Tell me why my parents care so much about what I pursue solely because of their reputation. I am being forced to take MBBS (medical/doctor) even tho I don't want to because they want me to and I am also being forced to break up with my boyfriend and have also been through numerous situations of physical and verbal abuse for the both of them. After a certain point in life I feel like its a bit too much when your parents try to control things that don't bother them like if u want me to do something so tedious and suicidal as medical then you should've done it yourself and not just force me to do something I don't want to do. Abusive parents may not realize it but when they're giving birth to a child its not just a child its a whole person. The person does not have to think like you, act like you, or live like you. Its so ridiculous at this point and it pisses me off. REALLY BAD."
"My mother wrongfully hit me when I was young, and when she got tired she left… and then she came back refreshed and continued to beat me. Nothing I said could make her stop. 

It’s decades later but every single time I think of her hitting me, which is every time I think of her, I begin to feel a deep anger. I do not like the feeling. It’s poisonous to my soul. 

I read the body keeps the score, and learnt about the ACE (adverse childhood experiences) test, and don’t want to die from a stroke in my 40s or  be “found alone at home” because of something I had no control over when I was a kid. "

"Please do NOT say “if you think hitting kids is okay then you did not turn out right”.

That is a circular argument, or a tautological one. We are establishing whether the claim hitting kids is okay for discipline is okay, so we can’t use that assumption that it is not in the argument.

Sorry, but if we resort to tautological arguments, we are no better than people who say “because I did so”. "
"*Controlling and Abusive Warning*

A bit of backstory:
My (29f) father (56m) has always been over controlling. Hated when I died my hair, and that I got small tattoos on my arms (all as an adult). 
When I had my oldest son at 18, he smacked my now-husband in the back of the head, which obviously wasn’t good for their relationship.

Additionally backstory:
A friend and I went for a walk the other day at a park and saw a Loon. I was so excited because I had never seen one (we live in Canada). My friend (20m) is from outside the country and I explained that a Loon is on a Loonie and all that.
We then realized it was a duck and I was disappointed. We continued to make jokes that I’d get a stuffed duck and name is Loon.


The story:
I graduated college yesterday and invited both my parents (who are separated). My mom stayed home with my kids and watched the graduation’s livestream, while by dad, brother, and husband attended in person.
After the graduation, my dad and I were talking and he said “so, should I kick your ankle out?” I was confused, then realized he had just seen my new ankle tattoo. I said it was cute, and my body. He didn’t like that.
After pictures, we threw a bbq at my place. Some of my friends—including the one who I saw the duck with—and their families joined.
My father was pressuring my oldest to hug him, which made my son very uncomfortable. I tried standing up for him by saying it was his choice. I ended up getting overwhelmed with the party and later found out that my father forced a hug from my son.
As the party was winding down, my friend told me that he and his brother saw a Loon yesterday while out for a walk. On instinct I yelled “Fuck, really?” Which they laughed at.
My father, who was across the room said “what did you say?” I then repeated myself more quietly.
He then walked over and lightly smacked either side of my face. (I say it was light, but another friend (21f) said it made a sound and my jaw hurt after.) he said I got a snack for either time I said it.


For reference: 
My kids were playing in the basement. They have heard me curse before and are old enough to know that f*ck is a “adult work”. 

I’m debating on cutting him off, or if I should give him a warning? I’m just scared he’ll call me yelling. 
We moved 3hrs away from him three years ago and I thought our relationship was getting better. Apparently not.
I had an anxiety attack at 1am because of the whole ordeal.

I also spoke to my son this morning and assured him that he is loved and apologized for not being able to stand up for him more and told him that if he ever felt u comfortable in the future, that he is more than welcome to lock himself in his room so he can feel safe (my father went into my son’s room when he wanted to be alone and ended up getting the hug then.
We don’t see my dad often, and my son has high anxiety too, so he doesn’t like hugging most people."

"So i guess the purpose of this post is pretty clear. My parents are both very abusive. They are what you would call helicopter parents. They try to control every aspect of my life. Recentyl, I graduated highschool and I am finally done with all of my college entrance exams. I have finally gotten a break after 3 years of continuous hardwork. I didn't have summer or winter or spring etc etc break. I also attended every single class diligently, even showing up to school with a bad fever or heavy rainfall.  Now my dad wants me to study AGAIN. He says i am waisting my time by relaxing and i am not doing anything productive. I like painting so I paint alot because I couldn't even do that for the past 3 years. I also like playing video games. To me, i am being productive by investing in my hobbies. I am autistic and i have adhd. I am extremely burned out. I even faint randomly. I feel so lost because my mom is also so overwhelming. She shouts like a maaniac and only cares for my elder sister. My elder sister who is 21 is entitled and toxic. She absues me and has always made me feel worthless ever since we were kids. She is shouting at me at the moment of me writing this post.

"hello, i am 19 female here. i have struggled horribly with my mental health, from the abuse i've faced as a child and teenager. i don't even remember some of my childhood because it was so bad, but these are just some that i remember. they have done so many things to me and i am just so sick and tired of it.

when i was a kid, my mom beat me for not drinking a glass of water and dumped it on my head. i was 4.

when i was a kid, i used her bangle to trace a circle, and i took a nap so naturally i forgot where i put it. she beat me and put all my toys in the trash thinking that i was ""lying and hiding it somewhere."" i was 4.

when i was a kid, she would hit me a lot for simple things, like not getting dressed fast.

when i was a kid, she hit me and screamed at me for changing my barbie doll's outfit, claiming that i am a pervert and i was creepy. i was 5.

when i was a kid, my mom asked me for the scissors. she was laying on the sofa. so i put it flat on her chest since she was laying down, not pointing towards her or anything. she turned to me, started screaming hysterically and crying that i tried to kill her, and beat me. i was 6.

when i was a kid, she would constantly say i have no respect for her because i didn't say ""mommy"" at the end of each sentence. she would beat me and scream at me. i was 6.

when my younger sister was born, i took a lot of care of her, and i was 7. they just let me do everything for her. i fell behind on my homework because of that and i got beat.

when i wanted to hang out with my friend who was a different religion from me, they would scream at me, and say horrible things about her and not let me see her. eventually i was not able to see any of my friends, and i could not even ask for permission to leave the house. i became so lonely. i was 9.

they would get mad when i wore pants in the house and strictly wanted me to wear underwear in the house. when i did wear them, i would get my butt slapped or squeezed by both parents. this went on until i was 9 years old. all of a sudden, they wanted me to cover up once i turned 10, and even wearing skinny jeans was horrible. 

when i wore skinny jeans around the ages 10-11, since everyone in my school was wearing it and i didn't want to be made fun of, my dad accused me of trying to show off my body to everyone, and screamed that i am losing my self respect. i was an underdeveloped child.

i got my period when i just turned 10. i was not allowed to have sex ed, my parents didn't consent, so i did not know what a period was. they said that what is happening to me is really bad and i cannot tell anyone. and i am not allowed to touch animals or plants, and i do they will die because of me. they did not give me menstrual pads, they gave me diapers, ""the ones old people use? and convinced me that i had some disease and i was going to die soon. they had me do that for a year. whenever i got my period in school i felt so uncomfortable putting on a diaper and so afraid someone may see it and make fun of me. i did not know periods were a normal thing until i was 11. i asked them about it, and their reasoning was i was too young so they were ashamed and thought i could not handle how to use a pad properly.

i was not allowed to listen to music that was not religious until the age of 12. when my dad saw me listening to music with headphones, he screamed at me, told me i was listening to vulgar lyrics, and i am trying to be an adult so bad by getting into bad content. 22 by taylor swift is apparently vulgar.

when i was 12-13 i dated my first boyfriend. when we broke up i cried and my mom noticed. when i lied about it she said she knew it was about a guy so i had to tell her i had a boyfriend. she beat me, screamed at me, threw a bottle of mouthwash at me, and threw my instrument i played for school, a saxophone against the wall.

when i was 13, in 9th grade, i switched my career focus path out of computer science to undecided as after one semester i realized i did not enjoy it. additionally, my parents were the one who wanted me to do computer science. i forgot to tell them i switched, and my mom saw my courses online after i switched. she asked me where computer science was and i told her i switched it and i forgot to tell her. that day she went ballistic on me. she called me a failure, called my whole extended family saying i was going to work in mcdonald's for the rest of my life, beat me horribly, and then choked me. i thought i was going to die that day so i pushed her, and then she started crying and screaming to my dad that i hit her. then my dad scolded me saying that a child cannot hit the parent but the parent can hit the child. my mom said she will stop this argument if i choose to either become a doctor or engineer. not knowing what to do i just picked doctor. i kept that path in high school for them.

when i was 13 turning 14, i had wanted to wear a dress to school for my birthday. she said my dress was too short even though it was above the knees, and i said it wasn't, and she said that i won't understand and i should get raped so i actually understand. a few weeks after that i got sexually assaulted in a hoodie and sweatpants.

we went on vacation and randomly my father started ignoring me and being misognystic towards me. and i started crying and told him to please not say that and women and men are equal. he said that i am worth a 0 and he doesn't care ever and over again as i was bawling in his face. i was 14.

i told my father i felt sexually harassed by my school coach. he said that he coach probably sees me as a grandchild and i need to stop assuming bad things about men. the coach pressed his front to my back while i was trapped and could not away.

in the pandemic my grades dropped and i was very suicidal. instead of supporting me, they told my sister to not talk to me until my grades went up. i was already incredibly lonely. i had a mandatory therapist from my school as my school found out about how suicidal i was.

i had to do a mental health screening with my pediatrician and my result was really bad. my mom talked about how i cut myself just because i got yelled at over simple things. the doctor reprimanded at her that she needs to actually support me as a mother and i am clearly struggling. she said i had to see a therapist sooner. when we got in the car, i asked her if i was getting a therapist. she told me to shut up and there is nothing wrong with me and i lied to the pediatrician.

i was really suicidal when i was 13 and instead of getting me help my dad dragged me on the floor with my hair, beat me until i was a ball on the floor, and video called relatives showing me crying that i wanted to die.

i started developing a bigger chest when i was 16. i was only allowed to wear baggy clothes then, and i had to dress masculine. my dad would compliment me saying i actually looked respectable. i enjoy dressing ultra feminine, soft and coquette fashion. i hated myself so much for the way i looked.

whenever i showed any bit of my figure or my chest looked big, both my mother and father would slut shame me and say i was losing respect for myself. i was 16-17 and i never had any self esteem because i felt so ugly wearing masculine clothes and not being able to show even a little bit of my figure which i had grown to like.

i gained weight due to depression and my family both body shamed me instead of encouraging me to work out or be healthier.

when i started going to college i stopped answering their calls often. i had to live with them during holidays though. after my first year i realized i did not want to do STEM and pursue the medical field. i was screamed at horribly by my mother saying what will happen to our family reputation if i end up a failure doing a simple job after coming all the way to america. i ended up choosing a field i genuinely liked after months of thinking but still makes good pay, but not STEM/med related. i wish they told me there's other opportunities outside of those 2 things to make a good living.

my sister was failing out of middle school and she did not get any consequences from it instead they just made me do her homework for her when i had my own COLLEGE assignments to do.

recently i have told them that i have a boyfriend and i have been going out with him. he makes me so happy and actually unconditionally loved. i told my mom and at first she sounded accepting. i felt hopeful that my relationship with her will actually be repaired. as weeks progressed she started being really aggressive and started indirectly slut shaming me, saying i have no dignity, there's no need for me to see my boyfriend and i should focus on school. my father is completely ignoring my existence for the last few weeks. after months of therapy trying to forgive them for all the abuse they caused me in my childhood and teenage years. now i am not being allowed to go out with anyone, but im going to break that rule. this is my last straw. after realizing that i can actually be unconditionally loved, appreciated, and cared for. i just want to leave. i don't care if it's a dumb idea. i just want to go no contact with them immediately because i cannot stand being treated so sub humanely anymore. i am tired of being controlled. i called the suicide hotline 2 times this week because it hurt so much and while i was talking to them something in me just snapped. i am just done with this treatment. i am so so done. i want to leave, i cannot live 2 more years like this. if there's any way i can get help financially to move out please let me know. any tips for this is appreciated."
"It's currently 1.50 am and my father isn't letting us (me,my mom and sisters )sleep he's breaking stuffs he's cursing at us(in the worst way possible)and he does this everyday we don't really do anything about it and sometimes when we eventually fall asleep he comes and kick my mom and throw stuffs at us ,play loud music ,tries to pick up a fight and more and on top of that he even threatens us that he would kill us(and he's tried in the past once )idk what to do like literally it's been years and we still going through the same thing everyday this guy is insane and he might really kill us anytime possible i asked my mom to take action about it but oh my lord nothing changes no one really takes our side he always acts as a victim which is so fucking stupid i don't even know if he is a human or not does he hates us to his core but what have we done nothing but exist and he does all of these for funn"
"21-year-old male here. My parents are generally loving and caring folks who have gone above and beyond and sacrificed *a lot* to secure a better life for me and my little siblings. Like all parents though, they have their flaws, some of which I deem as abusive but which they vehemently deny. So, Reddit, based of this list, are my parents abusive or not?

My experiences:

Woken up in the middle of the night by Mum and had the living shit beaten out of me in bed after she went through my phone (which I let her borrow because hers wasn't working) and saw me exchanging mild terrorist jokes with my friend on WhatsApp

Belted several times by both my folks, such as for talking to two strangers about my personal life due to ""Stranger Danger"" when I was about 10 or getting into arguments with my siblings

Smacked in the head by both my folks multiple times, such as for accidentally miswriting something on a homework report or being unable to tell the time in my preteens

Pinched multiple times by both my folks for various misdeeds, such as not wanting to take my shirt off during a family outdoor activity in the spring or innocently behaving inappropriately as a kid

Had a small chair smashed over my head by Dad for getting into an argument with my sister

For various other misdeeds, I've been kicked, violently shaken like a rag doll, beaten with a wooden spoon, had something thrown at me, forced to kneel on the floor and raise my arms up in the air until told otherwise, made to stay outside the house in the wind wearing a shirt and shorts and I don't remember who said it exactly, but I think I recall one of my folks threatening that they might not be able to control themselves if they're sufficiently pissed off

I've been threatened with bodily harm countless times

I've received several death threats, even if they weren't serious

If I showed a hint of resistance towards Mum's physical discipline by reflexively protecting myself, she'd guilt-trip me by saying, ""So the son strikes back, eh?"" even though I would never and was nowhere to retaliating on Mum, only shielding myself. Even at age 21 when I confronted her about her physical discipline, she defended herself by claiming that I only focused on the negatives and never the positives of their parenting and she doesn't regret anything she ever did to me and that even if I was aged 24, she would still dole out the physical punishment if she wanted to. When I said I won't let her touch me, she once again asked me if this meant I was going to start beating her back. I said I'd never lay a hand on her nor had I even thought of doing so, it's just that I wouldn't let her touch me, that's it. She asked what if she were to throw a shoe at me, would I throw the shoe back at her and I said no, I'd just keep a distance from her and she lost all control and started berating me for being an ungrateful son, etc before abruptly changing her tune and claiming she was only joking

One time, Mum was continually interrupting my conversation with Dad over the phone, causing me to tell her in frustration that I'm trying to talk on the phone, but which she misinterpreted as me telling her to shup up or something, resulting in her immediately getting physical with me

Had Dad being angry and yelling at me to stop crying during shower time as he doused me with cold water (which I absolutely hated but the hot water wasn't working) when I was about 6 after we actually enjoyed a sweaty game of football with some local kids, which soured the experience for me and made me reluctant to play football outside again since the only way I could play was if I had either of my folks with me

One summer vacation, we were at the beach in the sea, and Dad was trying to take me to the deeper levels despite me being very uncomfortable as I couldn't swim properly yet, resulting in me almost drowning when he left me to it but Mum saved me

Another time, Mum was continuously making fun of something I wrote in a book, causing me to smack the book out of her hand in anger, which she beated me for and locked me up in my room

In my later teens, Dad would frequently get me to help him out in incredibly strenuous activities which would often completely physically drain me, both when we were refurbishing our house and building our up-and-coming shop, to the point where the neighbouring shopkeepers who saw how tirelessly I worked for him expressed concern by telling him to go a bit easy on me and at least pay me for my efforts, which he addressed by asking me ""Don't they know you're my son?"" I never once complained or declined his requests to help out since I knew we were tight on money and Dad was making use of all the free help he could get. My only issues were some instances of potential abuse, such as when he got angry and started yelling at me to perform a task that I genuinely didn't understand how to do. I remember pleading with him to help me understand, but he continued to get frustrated and scaring the shit out of me. Or this other time where after a hard day's work at building our shop, I didn't immediately acknowledge something Dad said to me, leading him to berate me for my supposed social blunder. When he just wouldn't let up, I then proceeded to remind him of a social blunder he once committed, causing him to punch me in the face and berate me more until we got home. When we arrived home, I was offered dinner which I declined solely because I was uncomfortable being around him and so wanted to immediately go to bed, but he forced me to sit right next to me and eat while he shot a death glare at me, which I interpreted as him asserting his dominance over me

Dad could be very short-tempered and erratic on occasion, to the point where I would feel like I was walking on eggshells around him at times, such as when I woke up one morning and greeted him with a casual ""Hellooo"" that had a bit of a drawl to it and he suddenly froze up and looked at me with a death glare and I quickly apologised, scolding me for laying my heavy head back on the sofa while he spoke to me, scolding us if me or my siblings said ""Excuse me"" if he was in our way in the house since apparently that was too formal and not something you'd say to a family member (especially a father), or if we forgot to say ""Good Morning"" to him after waking up. I've actually had to appeal to Mum to ask him to control his temper on a couple of occasions and as a result I feel like I can never truly relax around him

On multiple occasions, I've been forced to eat something even if I didn't want to

They were pretty strict, restrictive and judgmental folks and could be overbearing. Mum would never let me visit another schoolmate's house without them having visited ours first, as she explicitly explained so herself and even that was a moot point because she didn't want any peer of mine coming over anyway, so none of my peers came over to my house (until I was 18 and that was only because I showed up home with him unexpected and practically begged her to let him come in) and I'd never been to any of my peer's house (apart from this one guy's house and that was without her knowledge or consent). She forbade all social media apart from WhatsApp and even that I always used in secret when texting people since I knew she'd find some way to be judgmental about it. She wouldn't let me go play football with my friends if she didn't drive me over there herself so she would know the location and even that was reluctantly expressed, so I almost never played with them outside of school anyway. Throughout our teens, she forbade TV on the weekdays save for Friday, which she would brag about to her friends, and very rarely let me hang out with others after school for a social outing, discounting the after school badminton club on Thursdays in my mid teens which took place at school. Though I guess this could once again be chalked up to being money-conscious, but also being overly distrustful of everyone in the UK. Dad could also get like this, such as making us do school work on Friday after school or insisting on cutting my fingernails even as he was making me bleed

They both generally either discouraged or outright forbade my interest in certain things, particularly fantasy, which included things like Mum eventually forbidding me from reading *Harry Potter*, berating and almost getting physical with me for watching a Bond film with my siblings when I was about 14 and just when I thought she couldn't possibly find an angle to criticise on me watching *My Little Pony* she reproached me for a kiss scene that took place. This trait of theirs got completely overblown after my little brother's nervous breakdown, causing Dad to completely ban our former interests in comic books and Naruto, reprimand me for watching *13 Going on 30* due to its fantastical elements and disapprove of us playing *FIFA*, to the point where I genuinely felt like I couldn't enjoy anything when around them. They would also criticise us a lot for relatively minor things and their lectures could be excruciatingly long, spanning hours. They also had next to no concept of privacy, entering our rooms without ever knocking (unless they knew we were changing) and confiscating our phones a couple times for no real reason whatsoever

All this has led to me being incredibly sneaky about what I do. I never let them see me with my phone, only ever using it out of their eyesight and I routinely deleted shit stored up on it in case they randomly needed my phone, which they would. I also became adept at lying as well as identifying footsteps. I think due to the sort of parenting they employed, I was very anxious and scared during these particular events:

My primary school teacher once lent me her *Harry Potter* DVD box set and I didn't even get past the first film from great fear that Mum would catch me watching it and get angry

During one summer vacation back to our homeland, the plan was that Dad would remain in the UK for a bit while the rest of us would go to our country before he joined us. I knew that Harry Potter would be running on some of the TV channels in the UK and throughout the portion of the summer holiday where Dad was still in the UK, which was several weeks, I was deathly afraid of him watching the films and finding out that this was what I liked

I had a bedwetting problem for most of my life. One time when I was about 5, Dad woke me up in the middle of the night to discover that I'd once again wet the bed. He angrily told me to get up, told me to face the wall and remain in that position in my piss-stained clothes as punishment while he changed my bed and made me go back to bed again after he'd changed my clothes

I have noticeable bumps on my foreheads which I remember where obtained from hitting my head on the ground as a toddler but which Mum claims are just natural or something, which I interpret as gaslighting

Mum accused Dad of cheating on her, but he proved he wasn't. Years later when I enquired as to what their fight was about she told me the truth (that it was a misunderstanding over his fidelity) which I suspected was the case back then. When I brought it up again later, however, she totally lied about it for some reason, which I again see as gaslighting

When Mum caught me watching porn for the first time ever at age 12, she berated me by asking whether this also means I would like to see her or my sister naked

During some of our more heated arguments, Mum has claimed that I wouldn't care that she died several times despite me having been an incredibly devoted and loving child towards her during my preteens and early teens

When I was a kid, I told Dad I wanted to make cartoons in the future as a career and he said that that job was for a software engineer. As an adult, I realise now that he was being manipulative

I once remember asking Mum if she loved me unconditionally which she confirmed. When I asked Dad, he tried to brush it off. When I asked him again, he got a bit pissy about it, so I dropped the topic assuming that his love wasn't unconditional. And even though Mum has repeatedly told me that she loves me and my sister equally and doesn't play favourites, I have found myself struggling to believe it. This is because she has nowhere never inflicted the same level of abuse towards sis as me and tends to send her off with only a reprimanded for more egregious misdeeds than me, like sis going inside her bedroom without her permission and stealing her makeup or eating some snacks that Mum specifically said not to whereas she has repeatedly gotten physical with me for genuine mistakes even though I was a much more well-behaved and devoted child towards Mum than sis ever was especially during my preteens and early teens

They both had a tendency to downplay my mental health issues, instead advising me to turn myself over to God. Thing is, I no longer believe in God so that advice was falling on deaf ears and I am terrified of coming out to them as an atheist because of their fundamentalist beliefs

After deceiving my parents for two years about my online learning, while it was justified to an extent, Dad *really* let me have it, telling me in no uncertain terms every opportunity he had how extremely let down he was, how he'd never seen anything like this happen anywhere in his entire life (he was 55 at this point) and how my deception and failure were among the two biggest tragedies/disappointments in his life, the other being the civil war raging in our homeland. Mind you this civil war resulted in the genocide of thousands upon thousands of our ethnic tribe. He would also say that he's so angry but he can't beat me to let it out because I'm an adult now (I was 20 at the time), so he's forced to stew helplessly in his own anger

My little brother's experiences:

Got the living shit beaten out of him by Mum after he was tricked by his friends into writing ""fuck"" on a whiteboard. He didn't even know what it meant, but I could hear his pitiful wails and screams coming from the bedroom where Mum was beating him

He accidentally tripped and broke a stair pillar while we were organising the shoe room once, causing Mum to lose it and get physical with him. When I brought this up with Dad years later, Mum either lied about the events or didn't recall it well, the former which I interpret as another round of gaslighting, but regardless Dad was more inclined to believe her than me

During his psychosis when he had trouble eating or drinking, Mum got physical with him by trying to forcefully make him drink some water along with his med, causing it to spill all over his face

He's also been pinched and smacked on the head several times for various misdeeds

He's also been threatened with bodily harm several times

My little sister's experiences:

When my sister was 10, some of her friends called her from Dad's phone. She asked if she could pick up and he said yes so she did but when he asked her to give him the phone she impulsively hung up. Dad slapped her hard across the face for it.

Mum hit her because sis was taking too long to get ready to go on a mandatory walk

Mum got very physical with sis after she found out that sis was getting some remote IT person to help out with fixing an issue on a laptop she was working on

When sis was 12, Dad punched her around the back of her head for going to his and mum's room in the morning to look for clothes

When she was 13, Dad threatened to gouge out her eyes and cut her legs if she wore mascara

Dad hit her across the face because she sighed during one of his lectures

Dad told her he wasn't abusive as other parents as they go so far as killing their kids so he's not bad

Dad punched her around the face for sighing during another lecture even though she never did, causing her to cry right before putting on a school performance

Dad beat her legs with a belt until a flap of skin came off and she bled for 5 minutes because she had a tiny bit of mascara on

Dad punched her numerous times in the back of her head because she had plucked her brows and forced Mum's hands behind her back and shoved her onto the bed when she tried to intervene

When sis was 9 and late to school as the car was down, Dad rode her to school on a bike but her leg got caught in the wheel as they were going full speed which almost literally caused her foot to be cut in half. She was in so much pain but he wouldn't check the wound until her friends at school insisted she get it checked because she could barely walk

Dad frequently threatens to beat and throw things at her if angry enough and she's a young adult

Dad slapped her across the face when she was acting bratty towards him and took her upstairs to slap her up some more

Dad tried to make sis study almost every day of the summer even though she was already a good student attending grammar school

Dad got pissy with her for simply reading literature during her study breaks and disallowed her from doing so

So, Reddit, are my parents abusive?"
"Hello, I came here on this thread to ask for help 
I 20 (f) currently live in France and live in a very toxic household with parents that abuse me physically and mentally.


A few years back I met someone who lives in the United States and it’s been a moment we’re talking about meeting each other again and have me come over to spend some vacation 

Of course telling my parents would have been hard but I put enough on the side and managed to get a plane ticket back and forth to see him


I recently told them I’m going at first they were supportive of it until 2 days ago and now they’re forcing me to cancel my plane tickets and force me to go back to my country which is an isle far away from France (it’s still part of France) and I don’t know what to do I’ve been encouraged to not cancel the ticket and still go but I’ve been threatened that my sister who is with my parents to make sure that I get on that plane


So right now I’m really confused and I don’t know what to do which is why I’m asking help here on Reddit "
"So my mom got remarried when I was 12 and I’m 23 now. I already went through college and graduated and had to move back home because the job market is just terrible and I cannot support myself even with roommates. Upon moving back home I noticed ring (the security company) cameras started getting placed outside my bedroom door. Then another one got added pointing at the fridge. I’ve suffered with an ED my whole life and get extremely anxious about eating around anyone let alone my stepdad who I actively hate as he has emotionally and verbally abused me since I was 12. To counter this, I started covering them up with a dish towel when I would make food and then uncovered them when I was done. I got a pretty hateful text from him yelling at me for covering them up saying they’re because I’m not allowed to eat anything I didn’t buy because I’m grown… like that’s fine but it was never discussed with me… my mom always feels like she’s stuck in the middle with us because we never get along but she’s acting like there’s literally nothing wrong with a stepdad putting cameras outside his 23 year old step daughters room and occasionally when I’m not home, going through my room and drawers to try and “catch me in the act” whatever that means. Am I in the wrong for covering up the cameras?"
"My father has been abusing me verbally and physically for my whole life. I’m 17 now and my parents were separated for 2 years. During that time I was so happy, but because in my culture it’s frowned upon if a woman lives alone without her husband, my mother’s  family forced her to get him back. Father has hit my mother many times, once he even broke a bucket on her head. He has hit her with a large metal spoon to the point where the spoon was completely bent. My mother is a strong woman and she didn’t take his bullshit and kicked him out. He has hit me many times, with wood, metal, broke my nail, left my entire arm bruised, almost pushed me to death because I defended myself, kicked me because I didn’t massage his feet right, told me to kill myself when I asked him to recharge my mobile phone, beat me with his shoe in front of everyone because I didn’t get his phone on time when it was ringing. And many more. When my mother brought him back I was devastated. Since that day onwards I’ve been having insomnia, I can’t eat properly, I don’t wanna live, I wanna run away, I’m always irritated. My father is jobless and my mother is working so he tries to act sweet to her because he hasn’t got any money (all he does is sit and watch tv all day and acts like he’s the most knowledgable person in the world) he’s and asshole and he knows that I don’t like him so he makes sure that my life is a living hell. He’s always criticising and ridiculing any minuscule thing I do. He tries to control me. I hate him so much I wish we would just die. When I told this to my mother she said that she’s too tired to listen to me and always tells me to just obey him. I hate my life I’m so tired I’m so fucking done I’ve been living like this for my entire life. What do I  do please someone help. My best friend betrayed me. Her brother ridiculed me and she defended him. I’m so mentally exhausted"
"So my mom and dad divorced before I was born so about a year ago my mom started dating this man called Henry and Henry he was kinda weird but I let it go cuz I wanted my mom to be happy. So like 10 month ago he started living with us the first time he hit me was that I didn't do my chores and my mom wasn't at home he hit me really hard and after that I told my mother but she didn't believe me and called me selfish.

After that when ever my mom left the house he hit me and make fun of me I would tell my mom everytime bur he didn't believe me.

I don't know what to do?"
"Hello, I am a 25 year old girl. I am currently living with my parents because my situation does not allow me to do otherwise (I am studying and unemployed). This Christmas my parents kicked me out of the house (everything was very violent) but as a result of my situation, I had to return. My mother is not well, she is an unstable person who needs urgent psychological treatment, my father is afraid of her and feels he is indebted to her because she forgave him for cheating on her for 15 years about an addiction she had, so he defends her in everything. I have no friends currently living in my city and in short I am quite lonely. Now I fear for my physical integrity, my mother had already hit me this Christmas (and during my childhood my parents always hit my brother and me) but yesterday she tried to hit me with a cooking pot (quite blunt) on the head. I wanted him to hit me, honestly. Because if I survived the blow I would have evidence to report her. But she was smart enough to control herself and she smashed the ladle on the floor (but that could have been my head). In case you are wondering, my father witnessed the whole thing without doing anything and supports her. Everyone who loves me is asking me to get out of there, even my brother who left home a few months ago. My problem is that the abuse has not only been physical, it has been psychological abuse for years where she has convinced me that without her I am worthless, I am useless and I could not survive. I know that being aware is the first step and at least now, thanks to my psychologist, I can see things better. I am trying little by little to learn not to blame myself and to know that I don't deserve to be treated like this, no matter how much I have been convinced that I do. And that I am valid and that without it I won't die. I'm desperately trying to find a job doing whatever I can to get away from home. In case you're wondering, I can't count on my brother, he also had to flee a couple of months ago, he sleeps on a sofa bed in a sublet flat and earns 800€ a month working in a bar. There are days when I don't want to wake up because I don't want to continue suffering. I am neglecting my master's degree because of this situation and my life in general. The saddest thing is that despite everything I have told you, I am incapable of hating my mother. I mean, I hate her at times and I know she is an abuser, but I feel sorry for her, I love her and I even want to help her others. I think this is the worst thing I have ever been through and I don't know if I will ever experience anything like this again or worse in my life. Considering that I am only 25 years old I think it is a strong thing to say. Lastly, neither my family nor I come from a marginalised background, we are a middle class (slightly upper) family who live comfortably. But my parents will NEVER give me money to become independent, they didn't even give me money to study, I had to have scholarships for excellence every year of my degree to be able to continue studying and last year I worked as a telemarketer to save money to be able to pay for the master's degree I'm currently doing. 

Thanks for reading."
"I (18F) haven't been allowed to go to friend's houses since elementary school when I went to a private school where my parents could actually know the other parents. I had one girl over after she insisted when I was a middle schooler in public school and that went awry (she behaved poorly) and since then I haven't been allowed to have anyone else over period. For years I was told no bf till 18, something I obeyed in freshman and sophmore years, towards the end of junior year I got a bf that I hid until they eventually found out  about - I was 17 when they found out. Previous to meeting this guy I had another very short term bf they also found about and I did dump at their command. Now, keep in mind, I've been a very good student for years mostly A's only one C in all four years of high school (macroeconomics), I took AP courses and DC classes and passed them all. So in all matters of college it's always been made clear by my father that I was to be a lawyer and there was no other choices - when I try to tell him about my passion for writing and computer science (separately - primarily interested in writing) it's shut down with talks of how I'm going to be a lawyer then a judge and do what he wants in our city. My mother is more lax on that, but still insisted I be a lawyer. And when talking about it to others or them it's easier to talk about what I'm going to college for a bachelor's degree for, so she took that as me not going to do it and ditching it for my bf who is two grades below me though he's 17. They badger me about this any time the topic is brought up and it significantly raises my anxiety.

Previous to having my bf, I was in a deep depression and they somehow didn't notice, he helped put me back together. The only times we could hang out though was in a club after school, so we did that and my father said I could walk to the local gas station with friends from the club, so I went with them sometimes or I went with the bf and we'd stay out a bit longer, just hanging out on school property. When my parents found out they pulled me from every one of my clubs and they had recently let me hang out with one friend out of school because they knew his parents well, I was no longer allowed to hang out with him either because I might be around bf. I am no longer allowed to do pretty much anything that means leaving the house. I own a car, but I'm not allowed to go for drives even though they said I would be able to. I wasn't allowed to have a job while in high school, so I have borderline nothing saved up for school, they also are unwilling to pay for my college in any form aside from MAYBE meal plan, saying that they did everything they were going to while I was in high school.

On top of the issues with college, while I was with my bf, my father kept threatening violence towards him - so I told bf to stay away from my father, also my father told me that if he ever was around the kid that he would hurt him badly. When I was somewhat allowed to be with bf they constantly would tell me that I was a wet blanket now, that there's nothing to me, and talk about how I was giving up everything (I wasn't in the slightest), and insult me frequently. They even got my youngest brother to start doing the same as well. I can't talk with my bf through text because they might see it and get onto me, I have to use apps that i have to delete frequently and my phone gets put up at night so I rely on my computer. They said if I ever go to his house they'll call the police and say there's drugs in the house. They also talk about how if I go over there I'll be raped by the stepfather, trafficked, that the parents will hurt me in ways that will eventually kill me and that when it happens they'll be on anyone's side but mine. (They detail the ways I would be harmed.)

In the past they've got me so stressed and anxious that I can't eat, I cry myself to sleep, then they threaten to take me to the mental hospital for not eating or acting upset in any way. I said I might not come home some weekends of college and they took that badly and went back to talking about every possible bad thing that apparently will happen when I go to bf's house. I have had to keep my best friend hidden for 4 years now because they don't like his family, so I have to talk to him the same way I do with my bf, through other chat apps. I'm barely able to tell them about my actual passions because they don't care though they say I never talk to them. It got so bad when I was somewhat allowed to be with him that I started making plans to run away, then I let it slip in one of our fights that I could just leave and stay with bf. Since then, they've been threatening violence towards him more than ever and they know the police and sheriff in my town and talk about how no one would ever believe I've been treated bad ever and that I haven't ever been treated bad. I really don't know what to do. I'm running out of options and all the options I have are bad. Stay, leave bf - be miserable and lose the things that make me happy and the main person I can talk to. Stay, stay with him, continue life like this and watch everything get taken away. Leave, stay with a friend so they can't find me, lose them and my siblings. In any situation I'm miserable, but if I leave, I just stay in the college dorms and stay with a friend on breaks. I hate it here too often and stay in a mild panic thinking that if I can just make it through the day, it's another day closer to being free-ish."
"AITAH for telling my bfs mom to stop mooching off him and get a job?
Ok, so this has gone on for YEARS. Bfs mom (we'll call her Karen) has REFUSED to TRY working a day in her life. She forces bf (20 yr old) to supply EVERYTHING for her. She has put his life in MULTIPLE ways yet she plays victim any time he tries to defend himself. She has tried yanking the gear shift in the car, tried to yank steering wheel, pressed false charges on bf's brother having him arrested, and now that it's just Bf and Karen in the house she forces him to pay ALL the bills, food, EVERYTHING. She claims she filed for disability but doesn't go to doctors, doesn't attempt to work from home in any way, or anything! He tried telling her to stop spending HIS money and she screams financial abuse and everything. I finally snapped. I'm literally dying and still pay my own bills. AITAH for calling her out for being an abusive lazy pos that needs to get a job and stop being a mooch, a leech, a bum if you will. She is practically a squatter."
I feel really bad for hitting her I didn't want to but I couldn't stop myself. I hate how she talks to me abuses me. Then she loves me too she says she will never do it again but she keeps repeating saying and doing this. I absolutely hate it and hate myself because I think I don't deserve my parents she does all the work tells me she loves me but she abuses me spits on me but hasn't hit me since one to two years. Idk what to do I always feel so conflicted. Today when I heard her say those things I couldn't stop myself from hitting her and then telling her that it would've been better if I was not born to her. I think I'm a disappointment. I don't understand if I'm wrong or right I didn't want to hit her. Idk if it's my fault. I think it is for upsetting her. She says the most vicious things to me I hate how she character assassinates me and tells me she hopes I get r worded. 
"I’d like to start off by saying I’m very nervous too call my parents abusers. That’s a very strong word very negative and it would mean I need a lot more help than I am willing to allow myself to believe as of right now. I love my parents. I believe they love me, but when I was younger, the way that I was treated is a haunting memory.

 My mother was the main person that would hit me physically. She would give me whoopings for something’s (which is in someways normalized) but she would also have bouts of angriness about things that I said, or did that would make her go absolutely ballistic on me. These were usually things that were small, but her emotions would be at a boiling point and she would let them spill over physically punching, and sometimes kicking me. This was mainly when I was younger and had less ability to fight back. I am now bigger than my mother so her trying to beat me up would result in her most likely also getting hurt.

 My dad has always come to my rescue at these times, afterward he ignores my mom for a week and she blames me and my disrespect (which I have said some disrespectful things but nothing to warrant that reaction) And then everything goes back to normal. My dad also has bouts of angriness they are less common than my mothers, and he usually does not hurt me as bad as he works to display that he is stronger than me. There is also a lot of gaslighting and manipulation that goes along with this that I cannot get into because who has the time😭😭"

"I'm going off to Job Corps in a couple of weeks. I told him I could take care of myself, then he laughed and said ""we'll see"". I know he expects me to quit the program and come crawling back to him... but what if I do? What if I can't take care of myself after all? I'm trying not to let him fuck with my confidence but I can't help but have that nagging feeling that maybe he's right. "
"As the title says. I've made several other posts about specifically what I'm gonna DO when I leave / get kicked out, and while I have a few plans for when it does eventually happen, the fucking constant stream of negativity is just too much for me to handle.

A while ago, my mom went out of state with my siblings to go visit some family. I stayed behind with my stepdad to occasionally clean the house and go to my stepdads office to clean for some extra money. And holy shit, best 11 days of my life. The anxiety was still there, 100%, but everything just felt so peaceful, and mellow. I genuinely felt happy. If I wanted to get up, and just make myself a grilled cheese or a quesadilla, simply because I felt like it, I could. I was able to finish watching Breaking Bad (a show my mom kind of blew up at me for watching, because my bio dad was an addict at one point, and for some reason she thought I was watching the show to learn how to make meth, which uh, just what the fuck?) and I was also just able to nap and relax whenever I felt like it.

I had chores to do, but I could do them at my own pace, and considering that I'm autistic and I have sensory issues, just being able to get them done when I feel good about doing them just... Felt absolutely wonderful. I didn't have to worry about getting them done literally as soon as I wake up, and I didn't have to worry about her screaming at me and bursting through my door because I put a dish in the wrong cabinet or some shit. I could just take my time, and do things at my own pace. I actually felt MORE motivated to do housework simply due to the fact that I could do it at my own pace, without having to worry about my mom's verbal abuse. 

I honestly can't begin to describe how nice it felt those 11 days. Genuinely some of the best days of my life, because I could just take things at my own pace and like... Be me. Something I'm really not able to do around her.

And then she showed back up.

From the first fucking MOMENT she arrived, we were already having issues. According to her, I looked scared when I was helping bring in groceries and stuff (expressing fear around her is a death sentence) and later, when she ended up yelling at me over essentially the same thing, she made a sarcastic remark about how ""OBVIOUSLY I seem to be UNCOMFORTABLE around her"" and how ""She doesn't HAVE to live here"". About a year ago, when she kind of forced me to admit I was suicidal (she hit me in the face immediately and mocked me), I let it slip that I was VERY uncomfortable around her, which is absolutely true. She's been using this piece of knowledge against me, and she brings it up in order to make me feel ashamed and guilty.

She's yelled at me a handful of times over me looking afraid and uncomfortable around her (she's been here like 3 days) and just... I am so fucking constantly stressed. My chest is tight 24/7, my mind is racing, my entire body just... Feels horrible because of the anxiety, my sensory issues are getting worse, and everything just feels so shitty honestly.

Another thing I should mention.

I'm using a backup phone right now. She doesn't know I own this. My regular phone was taken from me because she looked through it and saw me researching CPS and online abuse communities. This backup phone is basically the only way for me to talk to my LDR partner (my mom is convinced the they're a pedophile trying to sell me into a human trafficking ring, and she CONSTANTLY misgenders and generally dehumanizes them. Her reasoning for ALL of this, is because she found a message where they were discussing a VPN they used, that's literally it), and as well as that, this phone is my only way to research what I'm gonna do when I either leave or get kicked out.

I have a little under 500 dollars at the moment, and I have a little less than a year until I turn 18. I don't have a driver's license, and my mom got mad at me because of it, saying that I need to take initiative and ask her to take me driving so I can prepare to get my license. Here's the thing, I REALLY don't want to fucking talk to her, at all, whatsoever, let alone drive around a parking lot for 30 minutes with her breathing down my neck. But at the same time, there's really no other way for me to get my license, and I don't think there's anyone else who can take me driving. My current plan is to just save any money that I get, and try to find either a roommate online, or a REALLY cheap 1-bedroom apartment, which is easier said than done.

We live in a very Republican, middle of nowhere area, and there aren't that many jobs around. I'm afraid that if I get kicked out or leave or whatever, and I find a temporary place to live, my mom might find where I work. Absolutely fucking scares me. I'll also probably have to just walk back and forth to the store, wherever i work, and generally anywhere else I might need to go, and it gets HOT in this area. I honestly feel like most places probably won't hire me if I don't have a car, considering that I'd come to work sweating bullets every day. Other than that, in order to actually get money, I'll probably just try to donate plasma as much as I realistically can, because I just don't have many other options.

There is no way I'd be able to go to college ANY time soon, basically 0% chance. My grades are absolutely terrible, and I am NOT going to get myself involved with the predatory as fuck student loan system, not a chance.

Y'know how in TV shows, there's always like, a ""loser"" character, who just lives in a tiny apartment, and stays inside playing videogames or just hanging out with friends? I would genuinely be so fucking happy with that life. Just having my own, private space to live, and just being able to spend time with whatever hobbies interest me, and just generally not going out much. That sounds like the fucking DREAM to me, seriously. I uh, do not require a lot to be happy lol, not much at all. But even like, small, shitty apartments are EXPENSIVE now, and I was never really able to learn about things like taxes, rent, or any of that because nobody really ever taught me. Everything I know about paying taxes, and filing for disability, I learned from secretly researching overnight on this tiny backup phone that I keep under my pillow. 

Everything just feels so... Overwhelming. I'm turning into a legal adult soon, but I'm not really excited. Unless I know for certain that I'll be able to secure housing soon, as well as a job, it's kind of impossible for me to really be happy at the moment.

And even excluding ALL of that, I'm STILL constantly fucking stressed and physically/mentally overstimulated because of my mother constantly making my life absolute hell. Things just feel so bleak and hopeless. If she finds out about this phone, it's over, and I'm fucked. I won't be able to research housing options, I won't be able to communicate with my partner at all, and I won't have access to abuse communities.

Just... Any advice whatsoever would be lovely. I guess just about like, finances, tracking down a cheap apartment or roommate, getting a job, taxes, coping with the fucking debilitating stress, anything at all. Thanks for taking the time to read this. <3"
"Trigger warning: child abuse. 

This is going to be a long post that requires some background. I recently told my younger sibling a secret that we have been keeping until he was old enough and he did not react the way I thought he would. I really do not know what to do now and I need some advice/ validation? I am sorry for the length and how messy it will be, this whole situation has been rattling around in my brain and I think it will help to write it down. Please do not be afraid to ask for clarification. Names will be changed for privacy. I also do not know what community to post this on, open for suggestions. 

I (24F) have three siblings; I don't talk to one, but the others I try to keep in contact with. I will refer to the eldest one as Frank(28) and the younger one as Harry (18) .

When we were growing up, we lived in extreme poverty and the 2008 recession hit us pretty hard. Harry was too young to really remember to extremely difficult times but there were times I remember crying because I was so hungry. The house we lived in was also disgusting and we were never really taught the importance of basic hygiene. Our mother was a piece of shit. She would sit in her room 24/7, smoking cigarettes and playing on her phone and ignoring us at all costs. She would force our father to get her fast food while we were to scrounge whatever we could in the house. This forced me and the other older siblings to take care of one another, especially taking care of Harry. I could talk forever about how she did us, the older siblings, dirty. 

My father on the other hand, I want to say he did the best he could but I know better. He has a short temper and was prone to exploding and punching holes in walls. TRIGGER WARNING: he was also the one who sexually abused me and my older siblings until I was about 8. I have conflicting feelings about my father because how could someone do that to their child, a person they brought into this world to raise and protect. On the other side, he took care of us, fed and clothed us. 

After I turned 14, I started isolating myself. I kept to my room and focused on my school work, made online friends. A few years pass and I started hanging out with my siblings again and we became close once more. I did my best to teach Harry how to treat people with respect. He grew up to be one of the best people I know, which makes it hurt significantly more that he treated me in this manner.  

At 19, I moved out and I cut contact with my parents shortly after that. I know this was extremely hard on Harry because he was left alone with my parents. Despite our parents being horrible people- they were better to Harry than the rest of the siblings. After things became better money wise, they started to get involved in his life, going to school functions, buying him things, etc.. I have this one specific example: one time, when the older two siblings left the house, our parents wanted to go on trip. I was about 18 at the time and I worked a full time job and needed to give them a months notice if I wanted to go on vacation. Instead of informing me ahead of time, they told me a week before, rented a car, and then left without me. I was obviously very upset about this, and my father promised me that we could plan a vacation for later that summer. When they came back a week later, I learned that Harry had caused them to spend more than intended which meant that my vacation would suffer. I ended up paying for basically everything but gas and it was only a two day trip in our tiny shitty car. I am not bitter about the money, hell, once I got a job I spoiled that little boy too. I am bitter about how our parents seem to care more about him though. 

That is not the issue honestly, just a little background to understand more of where Harry is coming from.

When I cut contact with our parents, Harry was confused and hurt. I also believe that our parents tried to get him to tell them why I choose to cut them off. The thing is, I did not tell Harry what our father did; I wanted to let him have his parents while he could. Frank and I discussed that we would tell him after he graduated- but I ended up moving across the country when he was about 17. I felt that this was a conversation that needed to happen in-person. I came back to my home town for his graduation; I wasn't going to tell him on the day of his graduation because that would be awful and that day was about him. I was there for a whole week, I informed him months prior that I would be there. I know that week is pretty busy and hectic, but I only saw him for about 20 minutes after he walked the stage. I was supposed to go to his graduation dinner, but when I saw him on the field after getting his diploma, my mother ran up to me and tried to give me a hug. I stuck my arm out and told her fuck no. She ended up running away crying and my father told me that ""they didn't appreciate the attitude"". Honestly, it was pretty cathartic telling her no and it was the highlight of that trip. After that, I made a plan with Harry to see him at least once more during the week before I had to go back home. We went on a 20 minute walk, and during this walk I asked him and Frank to come visit me next (2024) summer. They agreed and seemed excited about it, and they had plenty of time to plan and save money.

Flash forward to December of the same year, I went back to see them. During this trip, I saw Harry for 2 hours at a local coffee shop and I stayed at Frank's apartment for the week. I reminded them that I will see them in the summer and they looked apprehensive which confused me. After going through the details, they reiterated that they were in-fact coming to see me in the summer. I chose not to tell Harry about our father at this time because we were in public and this was also the first time I met his girlfriend, so again not an appropriate time. Frank and I did discuss in length that we were going to tell him when they came up to see me in June. February rolls along, and I ask them how they were doing on saving for their trip to see me. This is when Harry decided to let us know that he was not coming. He felt like it was unfair to him that we did not tell him what was going on with me and our parents- Frank did not cut contact with our parents btw- and he told us that it was hurting our parents. He also expressed grievances about how it felt like we didn't care about him when we were growing up and constantly teased him. To clarify, we would joke about his hair because it was a little frizzy and his acne but nothing excessive and we would have stopped if he had simply told us it bothered him. Harry also talked about how it hurt that we kept this big secret from him and that we didn't trust him. To end it all, he said he did not think it was worth it to come up and see me. I was crushed. My baby brother did not think I was worth it. I left our group conversation and did not talk to him for months.

Now comes to the heart of the problem. In May, I felt like it was time to tell my grandmother what a shit human her son was- but Frank and I decided that Harry deserved to know first. I got in contact with Harry and scheduled a phone call between the all of us and this is where it gets super messy so bare with me please.

It was so awkward at first because I did not know where to start and Frank wanted me to lead this conversation. I asked Harry if I should just say it or ease into it. He told me to say it. So I told him that our father would regularly abuse us for a span of about 5 years. He said okay. This shocked me, and made me angry ngl. I was going to say more because I thought maybe he didn't understand the implications of what I said- he interrupted me and yelled that he heard what I said the first time. I was astounded. I asked how he could be so casual about it, and he said ""I thought it would be worse."" I don't know if I could ever forgive him for some of the things he said during this phone call. I understand not wanting to know the details, but he was cruel. I asked him if he remembered our father throwing our brothers around and his anger, he told me yes, but ""I don't see how hard he is trying."" Fuck that first off. I asked how could this not change anything for him, and he asked me if I wanted him to be angry. I was shocked, did I? Now that I look back, of course I did. This man, our father, was supposed to protect us and he caused us life lasting pain- yes I wanted it to change things for him. I wanted Harry to at least  grieve for our childhood, I wanted him to understand us more. Instead he was apathetic towards it and angry at us. He said that it didn't affect him then and it doesn't affect him now and that it hurt more that we didn't trust him. I understand him feeling isolated because we choose for him, decided that he wasn't mature enough. On the other hand, how could he forgive our father for years of pain and abuse and not forgive us for trying to spare him a little. 

I had a panic attack in the middle of this phone call and left for about 20 minutes- during that time I tried calling my support system. No one answered except my grandmother, who was deeply concerned but also was in the middle of a grocery store; I just told her that it did not go as planned and that she should call me when she gets home. I had a full on melt down in my car after that. After collecting myself, I saw that the call was ongoing still, I joined and things had calmed down. Honestly, I don't remember this part as much, but we apologized about letting our tempers get the better of us and I told them that I still wanted to see them this summer. It wasn't until afterwards did I remember the horrible things that Harry said and I don't think I can forgive, much less forget it. Harry has not made any attempts to contact me since then and it has been a month or so. I am so exhausted and I feel alone. I thought I could depend on my brothers but it is becoming more and more apparent that they do not feel the same about me. Please, tell me your thoughts."
"I’m so fucking done.(I’m not a minor) Every time I leave town. My room is rearranged. It doesn’t sound like a big deal. But it is. Have you ever had your whole room rearranged and stuff in random drawers that wasn’t there originally? Have you ever had someone throw your own personal items away? It’s miserable. I don’t know how I’m going to leave I do have a lot of stuff and I already have 5 trash bags full and no where to go other than a hotel. My dad doesn’t talk to me at all despite living in the same home and it’s been like this for the last 10 years of my life. He blames it on me. But every time I’ve tried to talk to him or do something with him he turns me away. I’m done. I can’t take this anymore. It truly is miserable. They’re ultra conservative. Don’t know anything else than the US (Midwest) and Mexico where my mom is from. Anything else to them is horrible and gross and why would anyone want to go there? If I say I want to go somewhere they laugh at me and ask why I would ever want to leave here even if it’s just for travel. I’ve never felt so violated before. They make me so violent, and I’m not a violent person. Them making me this mad causes me to have the worst anger outbreaks where I start breaking and hitting everything I see. My walls are dented and so are my doors. I literally am so done. It is so hard staying alive. I’ve had two suicide attempts now that have just had me admitted. I usually do think things will change and they never do because it’s not just me it’s them too. They make me look fucking crazy to the rest of our family to the point where I don’t even want to be seen at any family event anymore. No one understands what it’s like to have your privacy compromised over and over again and to have your own parents shit on your dreams. And how miserable it is to live with your dad who refuses to speak to you despite the countless times you have made an effort to make him happy. Sorry for the rant. I’m worn out and no one understand. I’m tired. "
"i (17F) applied to some jobs online and i'm hoping that any one of then accept me, i applied to like 4 i think and i really hope one of them employ me

but in the mean time i need to figure out how to get away from my dad's house so i can actually work. he doesn't like it when any of his children work so that we're financially dependent on him and i hate it bc he always abuses yhat power and holds money over our heads.

like my brother was working while attending college and somehow my dad found out and he told my brother to pick. either my dad continues to oaynfor his tuition or my brother works and pays his own tuition... my brother had a part time job at a bookstore. 

and ik if i ask him to work he's gha make a big fuss abt it and i just can't rn. i planned to go to Mt mom's house so i cab work but she won't be there during the summer so she won't be able to drop me at work and idk how to navigate my way on the street either bc my dad doesn't let us out the house AT ALL. it's literally just school and home. 

i feel like i'm going mad bc i can't stay inside the house all summer. two fucking months in Mt room?!?!? i've been doing tat for the past how many months now and the only time i went outside was for school. i can't just sit in my room all day anymore. 

the plan is to go to school on friday bc rn we have exams and you only go to school when you have exams, friday is my last exam and my last time being outside the house if i stay w my dad. so i'm gna go to my moms house but thr thing is i had to ask my dad first but now he wants to take my little brother too. which he can't bc my mom won't be at her house during the summer so it would just be me and my little brother. my dad doesn't know she's leaving and i don't plan on telling him bc then i'd have to stay w him and that means staying in the house all summer.

i need to convince my little brother to not want to come but he's gna want to bc he hates my dad too. my dad shaved his head bald, UNEVENLY AT THAT. and sent my little brother to school and he got bullied for weeks for it.

but my brother just can't come or else everything will be ruined. 

idk what to do, there's so many problems and so little solutions rn:

1. idk how to navigate the road if i do get a job and i don't want to get lost or kidnapped
2. i need to convince my little brother to not want to come to my mom's 
3. i just can't do this anymore. "
"Hey guys, I just need some advice on my current situation. 

I (27F) am the eldest sibling of 3, my younger siblings are (25F) and (22M). I have a stressful job, though it pays me well and I'm working from home. We currently live with my parents.

Dad (67M) has always been abusive since I could remember. He used to be physically abusive, but as old age kicks in he became less physically abusive but got more violent with verbal assaults and verbal abuse. Mom (60F) has always tried to be understanding, tried to make peace between us, but dad only got worse and all three of us could not stand him. He would blame mom when things don't go his way, called us kids names in front of his friends and make up stories (such as calling us useless who only knows how to ask him for money, which never happened. He would also tell his friends how rude we are to him and disrespects him as a father, when all we do is tell him how rude he is when he calls us names like sl*ts, bast*rds, and curse us to get married to rap*sts when he doesn't get his way, so whenever he did that we only tell him that he is the one being rude and he describes that as 'being disrespectful' but doesn't elaborate so all his friends believes him). 

Dad also makes a mess of the house and expects mom to clean up after him. She works practically 7 days a week. I occasionally help with the dishes and housekeeping but there are days when I'm so exhausted from work I just collapse and fall asleep, I don't know how my mom managed to do this for years. As mom works too because dad refuses to cover the house expenses.

My sister (25F) is moving out with her boyfriend soon. I've also considered moving out but recently I got scammed and lost most of my savings, so I had hoped to stay at home another 3 years until I could build my savings back up. However, my main concern is that I'm unwilling to leave my mother and brother behind with my abusive father. My mother is unwilling to move out because she believes that she could get into legal trouble for abandoning my dad? But I truly believe this is beyond her responsibility, and she doesn't deserve the treatment my dad regularly gives her. We most certainly can sustain ourselves if we moved out, but my mom refuses to. She is already 60, and assuming that she lives up to 80, I don't want her to spend her last 20 years enslaving herself to my dad.

Work stress, along with family stress, the fact that I got scammed because I've been careless, losing 90% of my life savings, and having to cope with losing my pet recently who had been my only emotional support is slowly taking a toll on my mind. 

I considered therapy but decided I prefer to save the money, besides I can't think of anything a therapist can tell me that I don't already know. I'm perfectly capable of rational thoughts at the moment, but living has been very difficult.

My friends all have rather alright families so I thought I rather not burden them with my family problems since it's pretty heavy and they might not understand the level of abuse my dad is inflicting on us. 

Any advice or personal stories that could provide insights would help! I just need another perspective as I don't know anyone who went through the same level of abuse my family has. I'm just trying to make peace with myself and figuring out how to live with my current situation.... Probably until my dad dies of either old age or taken by illness."

"The abuse at home is getting to be too much, because nobody will believe me on what’s been happening at home, being abused at home has made me into a jerk. My mom abuses me and it’s verbal abuse, it used to be physical abuse but that stopped a couple of years ago.

Because one time my mom got mad, and threw me to the ground by my hair when I was 12 and I haven’t told anyone but here on Reddit. She used to beat me with belts, wooden spoons, and her hand and it hurt so bad. 

I was recently told on Saturday that my mom talks behind my back, to my sister and says mean things. My mom hates me because my sister was told that by my mom, and my mom calls me annoying. 

I want to leave but I can’t, because I don’t have the money and nobody is hiring that I can walk to. I just need love and support by the people who are supposed to be there, but they aren’t. My dad doesn’t want me he rather me be homeless than me go live with him, talk about a POS dad. 

I’m tired of being abused, a family friend who’s a lawyer was always worried about my siblings and I but he can’t do much because I moved to another state. Nobody loves me or wants me. "

"My therapist messaged me this morning asking if we can call later today.

 Little background, I started therapy without my parents being aware because of obvious reasons since I'm posting this here. She told me that she won't tell anyone anything unless she legally has to. Aka concern for my safety. She also told me she would talk to me before she does.

Id like to say I've had social services in my life vaguely twice and they just walked out again.

I think I said something in Thursday in my last session that could have caused concern for my safety and I can't see why she'd want to talk to me today and couldn't wait until our next session unless it's so she can call social services or the police or something.

I'm terrified. Social services makes my life 10x harder. I don't want to go through this again. TBF I've already got it all planned so if she is going to call social services I can leave the second the phone call ends. My friend said I can run away to her house if social services are called because they honestly put me in more danger in many ways (I am 16 btw) but just because I have that plan doesn't mean i won't be found.. and I'm honestly so terrified about that too. Also there are cameras around my friends house so I need to be really careful not to be spotted by them if I do run away. 

I'm terrified. I have been shaking all day. I've been trying to do studies and literally couldn't because I was too scared. I haven't eaten anything today either... Which honestly isn't that uncommon for me but still. I wanna cry 😭😭"
"My dad is very abusive and controlling, if anything that doesn't go like intended then he will start smashing and breaking things in our house like a child. He even forced me and my littler sis to follow his bullshit rules such as we have to smile whenever we're around him, if not he will ground us or even worse, he will beat us. He always threatens us with violence if we don't obey him. Violence for him is always the best solution. He always complains why didn't our house happy like the other families and will blame us for making this house NOT HAPPY when he's the problem. If your kids are always sad when they see you, why don't you ask them why or maybe put effort into understanding them, right?? He didn't do all of that because he himself is a selfish ass who always cares about himself, he forced us to be happy whenever he's around like I've mentioned, how can I be happy if I'm being forced?? Every day in this fucking house is like a constant mental torture for me.

Is there anything that I can do to keep myself safe from him? Thank you."
"Honestly no idea where to start maybe last year? 
Anyways what happened is my father forced me out of my apartment I lived in for 3 year after he and my younger sister moved in during covid because he lost his job. I know huge mistake but my sis was 14 and didn't want anything happening to her.

Fuck family fuck life fuck police, fuck canada"
"Hello all :) im 6thsense. I’m 17F (to be 18 in a short while) and I’ve been dealing with my mother for all my life (go figure!). 

A little background: I’m extremely fortunate for starters. My family is fairly wealthy, and I’ve lived a comfortable life since I was about 6-7. I have always had my needs met and my life is pretty damn good. I’m extremely lucky, yes. 

Although I will say that in some ways, the amount of cushioning I’ve had has left me with poor self support skills. I am unable to handle failure well, I am financially ignorant as I am unsure how to do many basic things. (Understand taxes, paying rent, budgeting, labor etc.) This is due to my parents trying to both shelter me, and keep me from being dependent on them— but that’s another story entirely. 

In any case, my family is alright for the most part. All families are in some form of dysfunction, and that’s pretty normal. My mother, on the other hand- wields the narcissist trifecta of gaslighting, hypocrisy, and verbal abuse. 

I, on a daily basis, have to put up with being called slurs, made to do things because she is incapable of caring enough to do it herself, and picking up her slack. She is also extremely hypocritical and expects so much from me, without delivering anything in return. My dad is a hard worker and is stressed non stop because of his job and taking care of us. 

I am also constantly having to deal with the destruction of my character and self esteem. I can provide answers and examples as needed, but I don’t want to vilify my mother. I love her very much, but as adulthood approaches, I’m becoming worried that if I don’t get into college, all financial support will be pulled from me because of her and me clashing constantly. 

I want to know: am I going crazy, or is my mom truly a narcissist targeting me???"
"So for a bit of context, I (22M) was a product of teen pregnancy, my parents split custody of me before I could even remember. 

The situation with my mom and step-dad was always horrific, but that's a can of worms for another day. On the other hand, my dad, while not flawless, served as a solid foundation for my upbringing. In hindsight, that's all I could have hoped for.

However, when I was around 13, my dad succumbed to severe drug addictions, transforming into a different person, monstrous in behavior.
 
Now that I'm an adult, I seldom interact with him, given his frequent incarcerations. Yet, when we do speak, it's like conversing with a stranger; he's changed beyond recognition from my childhood memories.

Before he was addicted, my father truly was an amazing single parent. Looking back I know he made so many sacrifices for me, I have so many cherished memories with him. 

Despite this, he now seems to have forgotten most of those moments, it's like my father had died and came back as this despicable persona wearing his skin; I can't even love the father he once was when I remember the years of abuse and terror he put me through for years. 

My grandparents and some other family members, still naively hold a hopeful outlook for their son; they even coerce me (with best intentions) into interacting with him.
But I've witnessed the cycle enough times to realize he won't change permanently, despite temporary periods of sobriety or freedom from prison.

He'll have my family fooled once more, and i'll have to force myself at a safe distance as I hear about how my dad is yet again back to his old habits, whilst also leeching off of my poor beloved (gullible) grandparents.
To be truthful, I dont think I will ever be ever to see him in a positive light again, Even if he were to clean up his act permanently.

Nothing, not even time is going to restore his drug corroded brain beyond the intellect and personality of a dangerous child. Nothing can make me forget the feeling of dread after getting home from school. Nothing can make me forget the pure psycotic episodes. 
Nothing can make me forget the fact you ruined my permanently and fundamentally tore my grandparents apart; nor the fact you were also abusive to my grandfather. Nothing can make me forget waking up to being dragged by my hair, out of my grubby floor spot at 4 am. Nothing can erase the permanent physical and mental damage from being choked and punched, nothing can ease the constant paronia and dread from being stalked after finally having enough legal evidence to emancipate

 I miss my father greatly, but that man is gone forever; yet I can't even mourn him

When I was younger-ish just a few years back I was filled with so much anger it was noticable and poisonous. I hateful towards him and vindactive to loved ones who tried to help me move on. I would fantasize about revenge now that I was older and stronger. 

Then he got nearly beat to death in prison, seeing him in that bedridden state broke me, his face and limbs were haunting, a jumbled mess of blood filled eyes, black splotches, bandaged wounds, disjointed features, and grotuesqly swollen features from literally being kicked into the ground.

I could never do that to him, or anything remotely close. I felt so incredibly guilty, this is what I had wanted for so long, but it wasn't. I didn't know what I wanted, I still don't, he was so frail then, and still is now. I don't doubt his life has been harsh in the recent years.

This was the man who did so much to support me through two bouts of cancer, I probably wouldn't have survived without him. This was the man who constantly stuck his neck out to act as my shield, against my mother's abuse and neglect, this was the man who would make me blueberry pancakes before school just to silently say 'I love you'.

Yet this isn't. He is not that man anymore. If he wasn't changed by his years of substance abuse, he was definitely changed by his head trauma. I had realized this during our most recent actual conversation some years ago, it struck me that this man was seriously disabled now as well as cognitively impaired. 

This may be the consequenses of his actions, but it is both disturbing and heart-rending to see the father I once admired go through such daily misery and bodily suffering.

I can't hold any resentment for this man anymore, hating him would be like hating a child. Substance abuse and head trauma has irreversibly altered him, leaving me with a lingering sense of melancholy and pity rather than resentment.

In conclusion, I often find myself wishing he had passed away peacefully long ago, sparing us both from this ongoing pain. It's a sentiment that fills me with self-hatred.

TLDR 
My dad's struggles with addiction have left him less than a shadow of his former self, and it's a source of profound sadness for me."
"A recent development through therapy that I’ve found about myself is that I’m absolutely terrified of being in a relationship. Platonic or romantic- I’m terrified. Growing up was chaotic. I lived a balance of abuse and neglect. When my parents were home, I was a frequent target for my moms emotional, verbal and occasionally physical abuse. My dad is a door mat who never stood up for us (myself, and older sisters who got out of dodge years before I could). But then they would leave for days starting when I was young. I had to become independent young. 

I don’t wanna trauma dump but I want to share enough to make this post make sense. Through this time I also witnessed my sisters be abused like I was. They had much different responses to the abuse then me. Where my oldest dove headfirst into a small group of friendships, my older sister was everyone’s friend and never was in the house. I saw her and my oldest sister get punished for creating these relationships, and frequently my parents would shame them to me about their relationships.  I coped through being the under the radar daughter, the doing sufficiently to pass but not gain too much attention for grades or other achievements daughter. I kept to myself and didn’t build relationships, romantic or platonic because I was trying to be invisible. 

I’ve been out on my own now for the last 5 years. I’ve grown so much and feel like I can at least hold a conversation and “start” a relationship but I have no idea how to build a healthy relationship. I know how to love others- I jokingly call myself a universal donor of love. I can give every type of love away. I just don’t know how to receive love or even how to create a loving relationship that actually will last. People terrify me but I don’t want to be alone forever. 

Anywho, if anyone is actually still reading this I’d appreciate if you could share advice, stories or tips 💜"
"Throw back to 2020. My husband at the time 22M and I 21F had just gotten engaged, graduated college, and began searching for houses. At the time, we were living with my parents. A little back story, back in college we had just bought a dog and were living in an apartment when we found it had mold. I was sick from it. My parents told me that my dog would die from it if we didn't leave and insisted we move in with them and commute 30 minutes to college. To which I agreed. I am their only child btw. I had a rough upbringing. I thought I was just rebellious but am realizing now they are control freaks. My dad told me when I was 16 that he put a gun to his head outside and almost pulled the trigger and it would have been my fault. My mom called me fat multiple times, forced me into pageants i didn't want to do. she saw my bf kissing me once and wouldn't talk to me for 3 months, couldn't even be in the same room as me or look at me without crying. Oh and she kept saying it's just my first wedding every chance she got. They both told me that being a labor and delivery RN is gay and that I would be a terrible nurse, but I have proved them wrong. There is much more in between all of this but here's some.

My husband and I were searching for houses, we were going to buy one when we told my parents we'd be moving out. They begged us to stay, said we could transform the garage into a living space and they would move out there. They said they would sign the house over to us. My husband was fond of the idea since he didn't want to live in a neighborhood and my parents have 10 acres. I was not fond of it, but knew we would save money in the long run. So we got a contractor and cashed out my husbands inheritance from his deceased father (he died when my husband was 18). I used all of my savings to help pay. It amounted to about 100k after everything.

As soon as we paid, my parents demeanor changed. They became rude and insensitive, saying all sorts of horrendous things. They began heavy drinking mid 2020 because my Grandma died and their life was over.

The drinking got worse, my dad called me a bitch for not wanting to pay $7k for painters. I told them we would paint it ourselves. It wasn't good enough for them. They have caused fights about us throwing out a paint can, screaming ""one hundred dollars isn't a lot to you but it is to us"" and proceeded to say they ""don't know how its going to work here"" and that they might just take us off everything. 

Flash forward to many stupid fights later, we are here and they haven't signed the house over. They claim they are trying to merge the property from my Grandma to their house then they will sign it over. We put an additional 50k into much needed upkeep that they fell short on for 30 years. I'm currently pregnant with our first two children.

We have had many fights over the dumbest shit. I could go into so many details but we would run out of space. They have made claims that we're taking advantage of them, how they've sacrificed so much and we haven't done anything for them. They blew their top over a paint can saying ""100 dollars isn't much to you but it is to us!"" They have threatened to not add us on the house and have said multiple times this isn't going to work. Even better my dad and mom refused to stop smoking and drinking around my babies because ""it doesn't affect them"". I used to visit every day before I got pregnant and was super sick. But now I visit once a week. But that seems to not be good enough.

It was my baby shower today. Keep in mind, my mom didn't throw me a bridal shower and claimed she was too busy with the renovation even though my husband and I were handling everything. She didn't offer to throw me a baby shower either. My husbands Grandma and my friend did.

Last night I texted my Mom saying that we would be leaving at 9. I figured we would be riding together since we live together and she is going to be a Grandma. Well, my mom ignored me and had my father text me. He told me that she won't be riding with me and she will be riding with a cousin. I told him I think that looks poor given she is the Grandma and shouldn't be arriving with other guests. He texted me saying my husband told him that we can't give my mom a ride. I know this is not true.

What happened was that my husband took the dogs out and at the time had a lot on his mind from work. My dad said my Mom will need a ride to the shower. My Mom insisted she didn't and would drive herself (their car is old and breaking which they have also insinuated that we should be buying them a car). My husband said that either way works and just let us know. Continuing, my father told me that he doesn't want to leave anything to us because of this. And I left it at that.

In the morning, my Mom texted saying she wants to ride with us which we agreed. She never apologized for the behavior or anything, just pretended like nothing was wrong.

My shower was less than ok. My entire family breezed past me, barely asked about my pregnancy or the babies and talked to my Mom. I sat in the corner with my friend and husbands Grandma while my Mom entertained all of them. She excluded my husbands Grandma from the main dining table and spent an hour talking about how hard her life is with my Dad and his health problems. ""Nobody knows what I go through"" she says. 

The shower basically felt like a show for her. My cousin said ""I heard you and (my Dad) built a tiny house. That must have been expensive."" My mom says ""yeah we did!"" I walked over and said that MY husband and I paid for it. it was asked why my husband and I aren't living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one. I told them it wasn't our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house.

My mom didn't sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after.

After the shower, everyone left and I said to my mom that I wasn't aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything. She screamed to of her lungs ""YOU can't KEEP DOING THIS TO ME!"" My husbands Grandpa definitely heard. So do you think she's in the right and has scarified more than I have?

  
I am getting tired of the threats and becoming more concerned that they will try to evict us even though we pay the gas, electric, wifi, and television bills. With these babies coming soon, I don't know what to do. It would bankrupt us leaving without our money back and buying a new house. Am I ungrateful and in the wrong? "
"ive kept a log of the shit they've done to me. from the time i was about 16 every singl eoffense ive documented (ashamed of myself for not haivng startred sooner.) anyway, those assholes never cared about disciplining me, theyve never cared about helping me, thjeyve never cared about my wellbeing, never cared about my gfuture. the only thing theyve ever done towards me was inflict pain on me for their own saidistic purposes. i hate those creeps, bullies, and pathetic people. it si unfair ive had to live like this. with a nbunch of creep asshole parents who have done everythign in their power to inflict pain on me for no reason. i hate them. i hate them. i hate them. i hate them. i do. "
"what the fuck. i'm so tired of the assholes.

yesterday night my egg and sperm donor were cleaning the kitchen. I came to warm some food and my nmother told me to clean the microwave. i said 'okay' to which my nmother started getting aggressive. she said that i was being very disrepsectful and having a bad attitude, 'stop the attitude' the eggdonor said. i told it that i wasn't having an attitude, i just said okay while going to grab the materials to start cleaning the micorwave. I was defneding myself against the narcissist's lies. but that was when nfather came in. it started screaming at the top of its lungs in my face then slapped me. it screamed ""EHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? HUH HUH? STOP HAVING AN ATTITUDE.""

When i started to cry because of the barbaric attack, the egg donor started recording me and said ""look at this grown woman cryiing all because we took her phone.""

What a gross non empathetic disgusting excuse for a human being. i didn't do anything them yet the egg and sperm donors keep harassing and attackin gme. this has been my whole life on a constant basis from when i was in middle school and beyond. for hours on end my egg and sperm dfonor harrassed and shouted and phuysically assualted me (often times on school nigfhts when id have to be up 4 hours later for class. it'\[s a miracle i got good grades). they couldn't go even every few weeks begfore harrassing, attacking and bullying me. doing the bare minimum and neglecting me whilst bullying me on top of it. taking away my phone for weeks for no reason just to hurt me. everything those asshoe fucks have ever done has been to hurt me. i will never forgive them. i will NEVER forgive them. i hate those  patehtic bullies. i only wish they werent such cowards so they could pick on someone their own size."
"
sorry if it is hard to read. im not really in the right space of mind right now. 

hi im 15F and im really considering calling the police.I dont really want to get into it too much as im really upset about what just happened but ill try to summarise everything.

I have abusive parents.Like parents that would strangle you and stab a pin into your neck if you accidentally reply to them with “what” instead of “yes dad”. I have a parent that literally sexual assulted me many  time, as young 9. Parents that forgot to feed me for three days before,they still forget to feed me half the time.Parents that makes fun of their own child for being bullied. Parents that takes sides and will beat you if you don’t apologise.

As i have just stated, my parents are clearly not in the right sense of mind. And homestly i had an interaction with them and im really scared they will hurt me like they did a couple of hours ago.And im also scared for my mental health, i have done multiple forms of self harm such as cutting myself(i have the scares on my leg),overdosing on paracetamol( i took enough to feel sick but not enough to hospitalise myself so my parents don’t find out),drank bleach multiple times to “punish myself” and i have also drank disinfectant. when drinking the bleach i was so close to killing myself, the only reason im still here is because there simply wasn’t enough bleach. 

I know i need help and honestly i don’t think i can wait until i move out because  i will end up hurting myself or my parents will. 


I need some immediate advise on what to do and i don’t want to  hear from anyone that i should communicate with my parents cus fuck them.


UPDATE: i plan on contacting childlime so they can help me witj the process

UPDATE 2: bro fuck childline, theyre not helpful at all. Like they seem more intrested in knowing my full name and adress rather than helping me"
"My mom pulled my hair really harsh intentionally today before I go out to eat at a restaurant with dad. She said that my acne looks really bad and my hair is messy, and she got mad at me for that. So she started combing my hair, it hurts for a little so I grabbed my scalp to prevent it from hurting and she got annoyed from that because it was in her way. And so she said something like 'is your scalp that valuable?' in a sarcastic manner and she just pulled my hair really harsh and yelled at me when I yelp as if she expected me to be quiet after pulling my hair really harsh. This is something she would always do, she would point out my every little flaw on my appearance when it's so obvious as if I don't know, I would often get scolded or I think is what I want to call bullying by my own family members, they will continue on and on mocking me and I would act as if it was nothing and take it as a joke. But I think it's also my own fault for having really bad acne, my mom bought me some products for my skin care and I swear I use it. I thought that my skin has gotten better than before but my mom still kept calling it disgusting and ugly. She likes to comment on my body, pointing out how fat I look, I'm 5'3 tall and is 55-57 kg.
I take her 'insult'(I guess) as a thought of her caring about me, despite the harsh things that she does on my body.
I'm not sure about how I should feel about my mom, she can be so sweet sometimes yet get mad at me for everything and I'm trying my best to be a good daughter. And I don't really have anyone else to turn to or talk about my mom to(a little bit of personal information of the reasons why), I'm very worried to talk to my dad about my mom, because he's one of the person that I really hate the most in my life, and he's divorced with my mom and so I'm afraid that if I talk about my mom with him, he would get her into some kind of trouble. And I also don't want to talk to my brother about how I feel too, because I think he definitely doesn't understand how I feel and what I think and we've never talk about something like this to each other anyway. And with my other family members like grandparents and uncle, trust me, I've tried telling them many times but they ended up telling my mom about what I say to them or ended up being on my mom side and also telling me to listen to her."
"like they say shit like do you know that we had to take a loan for this fridge,this computer cost 1000 pounds etc like hwy"
like im in foster care and they keep saying when you come home... like why would i want to come to your abusive household anways 
lmao
"Hey guys I also suffer from the abuse of my parents. They take advantage of my mental illness and the fact that I am completely dependant on them. I want bad things to happen to them as they have robbed my teenage years of any joy. Text me for details, I can provide links, names, license plate, working place. I would even pay you to badly hurt them. I think people like these should not get away with their actions. They have repeatedley abused me and have knowingly caused my mental state to deteoriate. This is your opportunity to make the world a better place"
"Okay so this may seem weird but its like. A genuine thing i've been struggling with. Warning i don't have a lot of memories so if she has like.. done anything severely bad so me i will NOT remember

But Uh basically i'm a teen, Lived with her all of my life, My dad is out of the picture and for an extremely good reason. I know shes extremely emotionally abusive, Always yelling, blaming stuff on us, Getting mad at me (Oldest in the house) in particular.

She also let me start smoking at 15? Uh. she threatens physical abuse, Shes let my uncle (whos long moved out) >!`Burn my brothers hands with lighters and hit them`!< As well as shes >!hit me!<a couple times, but not badly. Just like a cuff around the head nd shit, As well as she doesn't really get painkillers anymore (ngl could be my fault) but i deal with extreme migraines (got them from her) as well as un-diagnosed knee issues (also from her) and she never gets painkillers no matter how much i beg her to

She also lets me and my brothers get into physical fights, and by that i mean they have >!kicked my knee out as well as nearly fractured my arm!<, Both of them are younger then me and both have severe mental health issues which they are on pills for but my mother simply reminds them and then moves on with her day and gets mad when they don't take them. She doesn't stop the fights and i do not initiate the fights because.. well i'm almost 18, My brothers are four years younger. 

Thats all I can remember but like.. Yeah. I just wanna know because my friend says she does, But i honestly don't think so but could that just be me in denial? "
"i (18y) have been abused by my parents and grandparents for as long as i can remember. my first memory is my grandad approaching me as i was sat down on a potty (one of those weird plastic toilets toddlers have) and picking my up by my shoulders. he screams something at me before he puts me down and slaps me across the face. i was about 3 years old. i feel the best way to talk about this lifetime of abuse is to tell it in chronological order from the best of my ability (my memory surrounding certrain things is hazy as for a while i tried to forget as much of this as i could)

  
firstly i think its important to give some information about my mum and dad. my dad was 17 when i was born and i believe my mum was 21. he lied to her about his age. my dad is addicted to weed and i know for a time he was addicted to coke too. i remember he would often get arrested a lot. he would also say he was leaving us but return hours later very clearly off his face on coke and whatever else. my mum is a very manipulative and emotionally abusive woman. when i was 7, i witnessed her kiss another man in front of me. we later on found out that they had been seeing each other for ages behind my dads back. i havent been able to forgive her for that. it's also important to note i have many siblings (i wont say how many as i have already given a lot of telling information and do not want my family to know ive typed and posted this, many of my family members use reddit). 

  
from the age of 5, i remember getting beatings almost daily from my mum or dad. these would be for the most minor of things such as forgetting to flush the toilet or turning the tv up a little bit too loud. these weren't little taps either, i got fully manhandled and punched. often i remember my dad pinning my down so my back is facing upwards, he would hold my hands around my back while my mum would hit me on my ass until it was red raw. no one can justify that. sometimes it wasn't always my parents though. sometimes they would call my grandad. for such a long time the word grandad evoked so much fear in me. when i was told he was coming over i would run to my room, but on as many layers of clothes as i could and hid under my blanket. when he arrived, he would berate me about how much of a disgusting little cunt i was before he would punch me in my face and all over my body. often i would have bruises as a kid, i dont know how teachers at school didn't pick up on it. i remember one Christmas eve my xbox account wasn't working (cant remember why) and this understandably upset me, i was 8 after all. my dad called my grandad over, and i did the same routine. clothes on, over the covers and pray he doesn't hit me too hard this time. this time was different though. he came into my room and pulled me out of my bed by my arm and threw me down the stairs. i ran into the living room where my nana was. she slapped me in my face so hard i fell to the ground. i tried to run out of the room only for my grandad to push me back into it. i was made to sit on the couch while i got called the most horrific names. i was so scared i wet myself and couldn't stop shaking. i was 8 years old. 

not long after Christmas, it was my birthday. i got disney infinity and a bunch of the little figures to go with it. for months this was my hyper fixation, i would play it daily and completed everyone one of the story set things i had. one day my grandad came over, and he started his usual borage of insults. he turns to my organized disney infinity figures resting upon my xbox 360 (jesus im old) and kicks them all over just avoiding the xbox. he then turns around and leaves. he broke so many of the figures, i cried for hours and hours in my room alone. no one came to check on me. the figures being broken hurt so much more than the beatings i was now used to. 

  
from this point onwards, things are a little fuzzy. i move house a few times and am now in secondary school. im 13 years old, and questioning my sexuality heavily. i get into fights both inside and outside of school and have started smoking cigarettes. the physically abuse had stopped, but the emotional abuse had got worse. at the time i was a very fat kid. i would eat to feel better. my dad would often call me fat and insult me for everything i did. every song i played, booked i read and film i watched. he would rip into me daily for no reason at all. he would often say if i wasn't his kid and he saw me when he was a kid he'd beat the fuck out of me. when i was 15, life started to get a bit better. i found a group of friends that liked me, i was no longer questioning my sexuality and was fully comfortable saying i was pan-sexual. i also started to smoke weed with my best friend, which has given us some of the best memories. in the summer of that year, we got evicted from our home and had to move into an emergency house. this was hell, and one of the worst times of my life. i slept on the couch and my pc was in the kitchen where often my little siblings would throw food on it and try to tip if over. my parents did nothing to stop this. the insults still followed and i was made to feel so insignificant and small. the most i slept in the 4 months we lived there was 5 hours a night. one time my dad was berating me and he got in my face because i said something back to him. he pinned me against the wall by my t shirt. for the first time, i felt all of the rage i had kept bottled up since i was a kid overflow and i punched him square in the face. he fell back and looked at me in shock. my mum rushed to his defense and screamed at me to leave. i left for a few hours until my dad called me and told me to come home. we haven't spoken of it since. 

  
now i am 18. i am in the last few days of college then im off to university. the emotional abuse still continues and there are so many things that im leaving out for the sake of length. i could genuinely write a novella about all of this shit. i am not sure what to do moving forward. i really want to block them out and live my life peacefully and free. however, whenever i think about doing this i feel really guilty. luckily i have an amazing and supportive partner who is helping me make sense of all of this. the scars still feel fresh. for anyone who is in a similar situation but has years to wait before they can leave, keep your head up. right now i know it is hell and it seems like there is no end. my best advice is find something you love and cling onto it, passion is found in the darkest of place. in my case, it was films. you are not crazy or being sensitive, it is abuse. 

  
any question feel free to ask, thank you for listening.

  
EDIT: sorry if some of this makes no sense im dyslexic haha "
"Hello everyone 🤠 I just want to share this ongoing story cuz I've been trying to wrap my head around it for years now and would really appreciate the feedback. So when I was about 4 years old, I was adopted by my aunt and uncle, whom i know call my mom and dad, because I have no other living parents that I know of. And when they were in the process of adopting me, apparently they were told by multiple medical professionals and child psychologist that I was going to have trouble growing up. They told my adoptive parents to always ""keep me on a routine"" and stuff like that. But anyways I've had my fair share of hard times with them, mainly after I turned 13 because that is when I started having more intense mental health issues. I was in and out of hospitals amd behavioral health centers until one fateful incident where my parents refused to pick me up from the facility. From that point I went back into the Same system that I was adopted out of. I was 15 at this point . I couldn't understand and still don't understand certain things that happened during that time. I didn't understand why when I tried to cally parents they refused to speak with me, called me a monster, and told me to stay away from them when I simply wanted to know when they were gonna pick me up. I didn't understand why shortly afterwards I had to sit in a courtroom with my adoptive parents, who couldn't even look at me if say Hi to me. I thought courtrooms were only for criminals so what am I doing there, ya know? They charged my adoptive parents with child abandonment but their parental rights were never terminated because they used my own mental health issues as a defense. Basically telling the judge that the only reason they didn't want to take care of me anymore is because of the trouble they've had to go through with raising someone with so many various issues. When I did get a chance to speak with them, they told me that they put me back in system because they love me and wanted to get the right treatment for me. Now here's where the problem lies. I have spent from age 15 to age 18 going from house to house, group home to group home that whole time while they were expecting me to get ""treatment."" I had to face abuse, confusion, unstable housing and education all the while wondering why my parents pulled me out of the child welfare system just to put me back in it. They barely tried to see me when I was in state custody but whenever the courts or my caregivers wanted to change something, they would miraculously pop up and try to paint themselves as superior by saying ""we still have our rights, that's still our kid, etc."" Fast forward to when I turned 18 and I age out of traditional foster care to go into Extended foster care, namely because my parents still didn't want to take me back after all those years of separation, even after I stabilized and got on the right combination of meds. I've always struggled with determining if all the confusion and mental turmoil that I was put through was indeed an act of parental love or not. It only confuses me further when I see parents who have kids with birth defects and developmental delays, but those parents would never try to hand their kid off to the state simply because they didn't want to deal with their child. So I just don't understand any of this, even at age 22 now. Once I turned 18, my adoptive parents started to make themselves more present in my life, noticably after they found out that I was entitled to a bunch of benefits, as a result of my circumstances. Nowadays if I stand up for the feelings that I do have, or my distaste for how they deserted me when I needed them the most, my adoptive parents shut me down and call me rude and say that I don't know what I'm talking about. Even though I live about 20 miles away from them, they'll hound and harass me for favors and if I don't have anything to give them (mainly because I don't owe them anything for the trauma I've endured), then they call me rude and a horrible daughter. I'm starting to feel like I'm only as valuable to them as the things that I can contribute. When I do try to nurture some kind of bond with them, then they love me, but as soon as I stand up for myself then I'm crazy and don't know what I'm talking about, according to them. I have a goal of buying my first house soon and I want to save up money for that. My parents know about that goal but yet they still hound me for money ... Almost like they don't actually want me to be able to stand on my own two feet. For about 2 months now, I've been no contact with them because I've wanted to actually take some time to process these events and many others and the feelings associated with them, without undue influence or distraction.
 So if you managed to make to this point of my story I would really appreciate some perspective and a better idea of whether or not I should try to reconcile with them or just remain no contact and move on with my life, without them. All opinions are welcome. Thank you."
"yung father ko ay want niya yung parenting na nasa kanya yung power. yung ipinagmamalaki nga niya, military type daw siya.

nanginginig ako habang tina-type 'to. I've been experiencing physical violence from him several times. Binatukan nang malakas, binato ng upuan, pinahiya sa labas, at madami pang iba. normal na rin siguro sa akin yung word na ""papatayin kita"".

ngayon, sinabunutan niya ako. ang sakit ng ulo ko. why? because hindi ako bumaba nung tinatawag niya ako para magsimba. alam niya ba kung bakit hindi na ako nagsisimba? because I keep on asking God bakit ko nararanasan ang pain 'to from him mismo. sa kaniya ko dapat nararanasan yung comfort. yung safety. 

pero no. tuwing umuuwi siya, ang nararamdaman ko ay takot. baka saktan niya ako... ipahiya...

alam kong hindi ako perpektong anak. madami din akong mali pero... deserve ko ba talaga 'to? 

yung physical pain kaya ko pa. pero yung emotional? ang tagal kong nagtiis. sobra. pagkatapos niya manakit, hindi ako umiiyak sa harapan niya. iniiyak ko iyon kapag mag-isa nalang ako. I've been fighting alone.

sabi niya sa akin kanina pagkatapos niya manakit, ""ngayon, alam mo na kung sino ang tatay.""

oo pa... at hindi kayo 'yon."
I have extreme anger when I get flashbacks of my dad making an angry face grinding his teeth while holding me in the air against the wall when I was 4.

"My Autobiography

From my earliest memories, my father has been a harsh figure in my life. I recall years of abuse, mockery, and physical punishment, including beatings with a belt. One vivid memory is when my cousin bit me, and my father praised him, celebrating his actions. Another painful moment was when he tried to abandon me during a time I was possessed. He criticized every action of mine, and my childhood is filled with memories of constant family fights.

When I was just 4 or 5 years old, he would distinctly say that he wouldn’t include me in his will. I had no understanding of money at that age, but the fear was real. His angry glares terrified me, and I lived in constant fear of doing something wrong that would lead to further abuse. He would kick me out of the house and demand the clothes off my back because he had paid for them.

At 11, I was sent to a hostel, despite my desperate pleas to stay. My mother cried her eyes out, but my father showed no emotion. His frustration with me was so intense that even when I made a harmless joke, he would get angry, only to repeat the same joke himself moments later. My sister pointed out the hypocrisy, but it didn’t change anything. As I grew up, my hatred for him deepened. He frequently kicked me out of his business and his house. If not for my mother, I don’t know where I’d be. I eventually found a job and was given a month to leave his house.

I started my own business and helped him set up a new shop. My marketing efforts paid off, but I never received any appreciation. Instead, I was always compared to others. Despite swallowing my hatred as advised, his constant taunts cut deep. I was treated like a plague in my family, avoided like a germ. 

When you are unloved in childhood, you search for love to fill that void. I did the same. After seven years in a hostel, I finally found someone who liked me at 16. However, the relationship didn’t last. I left a prestigious university because of my depression, which led to more taunts and ridicule from my father.

I always wanted to learn to drive and begged him for a driver’s license. His response was dismissive, suggesting I should become a driver to earn some money. I tried to build a bond with him, and things seemed to get a little better. I contributed financially to his business without making any losses, but any minor issue would result in a torrent of abuse. Despite bringing in thousands of rupees each month, I received a fixed pocket money of just 15k rupees. Eventually, I stopped taking any money from him.

During a period of depression, I found love again. For three years, I was happy, but then she cheated on me, and I lost everything. Now, I am heartbroken, holding onto the hope of a miracle. 

Please, Dad, stop abusing me. If you want, I will disappear. I can’t take this anymore. Stop."
"They contacted my school and the school talked to me, I asked that they tell cps to contact me before anyone else.
It's been 2 weeks and they haven't contacted me yet.

I've tried to talk to my mom about my dad but she  ""forgot"" and now there both getting worse.

"I’ve lost so many nights of sleep over this trying to make sense of something so heartbreaking and evil. I try to see things from both sides . A mother and a son. It’s all so complex and complicated . 
You see people will tell on themselves people will tell the truth even when they think they are lying …if you pay close attention to every word spoken…the truth will always be right there. 
From the very beginning there were red flags …things that were said that just didn’t seem right….and it got worse and worse the little things said  became cry’s for help. God blessed me with a gift sometimes it can feel more like a curse. I can feel others feeling I can see things before they happen I get warnings and messages. Most times they are 100% correct and small about of times I get information tangled. 
I could feel his fear I could feel his confusion I could feel his dedication to someone who should have been sacred to him but betrayed him with the worst kind of betrayal. I could feel your fear I could feel this absolute control you have sunk your teeth into. For future reference I’m going to list how it all came together. 
It’s started with him telling me how hot he thought his mother was .
Then when I knew he was avoiding you for no reason and not telling you he was dating
Then he told me about a conversation the two of you had
How you CONFRONTED him about seeing someone and his response was YOU ARE SEEING SOMEONE TOO. 
That is not a normal exchange of words between a mother and son. 
Once you knew YOUR behavior said a lot. The constant calling the phone conversations that lasted hours. The constant texts “hablame” 
Yes mothers worry and call but not like that. 
Then finding out you never did his paperwork for citizenship but you did your other two sons. That right there showed your fear and tight grip you have held onto him. Showed how an abuser controls there victim. Then the text messages…the inappropriate things said . 
Then seeing family photos …”a picture can say a thousand words “ that saying rang true. The body language was off . The pictures didn’t look like a mother and her sons it looked like a mother father and son.
Then watching the interactions between you and him and the way you looked at me . Then watching him interact with his “baby brother “ he didn’t know how to be a father and a brother and it all felt so awkward. 
He remembers every detail of when his “baby brother”  was born 
Yea people remember stuff about siblings but the in depth details he speaks of are of a parent. 
Then the timeline of it all. 
You leaving his father with him and his brother and coming to %^*%#} and during high school (right when you got pregnant with his “baby brother” you sent him away to live with his father in another state. ) 
It was your shame and fear of people finding out and if he was not around you could pretend it never happened and date a man who thinks he had a child with you. When moving back things were only normal for him for a short period before you started your abuse again. 
…..to be continued "
"Like the Title says, my mother is neglectful and abusive

I'm a 19 year old, I just recently moved in with my aunt after my mom kicked me out for struggling to get a job

Living with my mom was hell, her apartment is infested with bedbugs, she sits on her ass all day, smokes pot then bitch and complain

Dcs was recently at my mom's due to something Involving a ex brother, day before all that happened she was screaming at me that my siblings were gonna get taken away basically blaming me

When I was living with her I became depressed more than normal and had thoughts of self ending, only reason I didn't go through with them is due to my 7 year old brother

I need melatonin to sleep really badly, I asked her multiple times because if not my insomnia makes me stay up all night, fall asleep at 2 am then sleep to 2 pm

She would get pissed off at me for sleeping all day when it isn't my fault. I genuinely tried to get a job but no one would hire me

She let's other people come over possibly infecting there clothes with bedbugs"
"How can I do my mother figure (grandma) leave an abusive relationship? ik this subreddit isn't exactly about that, but I'll explain better.

She's not the only one he's abused, i am constantly verbally abused everytime they fight he tries to include me, and blames me for it. 

The last time they broke up he punched her in the face, and for better context we have a really supportive community, but they'll PROBABLY not help us anymore if she gets back with him.

Before he did that, he tried to beat me and even punched my room door (it's not made of wood or nothing too heavy) while i was in bed studying, so it almost hit me. My bed is literally close to my door and he knows it. 

Do you guys have any advice for what i could do to make her not stay with him? I'm planning to get on my knees tomorrow and beg for her not get back to him since ik they'll be back soon (she's already drinking with him after days and it's just a matter of time).

I can't go to my mother's home(she has a lot of kids, they do not have enough space, and I'll lost all my friends, and she'll probably not have enough resources to let me finish my studies), my father lives with us but he's not strong enough to protect me and he's also a drug addict (abusive).

I just need advices that really helped anyone in the same situation as me. I don't care if they're not healthy advices.

"Im fucking 18 and im being treated like a baby. My aunt (who is my cousins mom, moms sister) yelled at her for not noticing their was no trashcan in the tash and to put the trash in the trash bag and asked my cousin if she's blind (my cous has no contacts or glasses and is -4 something diopters mind you, not totally blind but terrible vision) and when i called the aunt out to help woth the trash can because my cousin didn't want to do it anymore and my aunt threw my hands off because i apparently don't understand so i yelled at her for it, she pulls my ear, my mom comes, and my mom doesn't care that my aunt was disrespectful to us (and others. alot). 



she even told my cousin to shut the fuck up, and i yelled at them (including the cousin at one point because she's an ashhole) for treating me like shit. I called out my aunt for controlling what i wear, fat shaming me, touching me without permission and complaining when i object, and yelled at my mom for similar things. i also yelled at my cousin for constantly being rude to me for stupid things i did as a child that i don't even do anymore and still holding them against me and ruining my life for it. my aunt also threatened to spank me in front of my mom and she doesn't care. my mom told me to go upstairs and give her my phone. im done with this house and im legit going to a homeless shelter soon. my mom yells at me for my anger issues, but gets mad at me for simple things!"

"Behaviors of my dad that confuse me between abuse or normality 

^^^^^^

Calling out their abuse = “I’ll show you what real abuse is”

Calling them a bully = “I’ll show you what a real bully is”

Crying = “I’ll give you a reason to cry”

Making fun of less fortunate friends ( friends who live in trailer parks, little money, divorced parents, etc. )

Yelling, screaming, throwing things, on a near constant basis

Hitting ( not all the time, and it is a ‘joke’ or ‘playful’ )

Not being able to figure something out, then live-streaming me crying as I attempted to figure it out

Slapping me on the butt ‘playfully’ or to ‘show affection’ even after I asked him to stop

Purposely aggravates me and gets mad when I have a reaction

Making do work on a farm for hours on end/coming up with new or unnecessary chores so I can’t take naps/play games or use my free time ( essentially taking all my free time )

Has woken me up on multiple occasions screaming and yelling ( After this happened twice I now wake up at footsteps, doors opening and closing, or hearing someone yell while I’m asleep because I am afraid it’s him coming to wake me up )

Physically ripped my door off its hinges for sleeping with the door locked ( he broke the lock and ripped the hinged off in the process )

Threatened to take my door for not cleaning my room ( it isn’t very messy but I have very severe episodes where I can’t get out of bed for days unless he physically rips me out of bed )

Took my hand that was holding a loaded gun ( I didn’t want to shoot and was crying ) and he unloaded the entire may directly on the ground infront of my feet and yelled at me

Constantly compares me to other people 

Makes fun of my body and then denies ever doing so

When I tell him off for being rude he either yells at me or laughs and says “are you on your period” or something along the lines

Won’t get me diagnosed for ADD ( not self diagnosing but I’m 99% sure there is something wrong with me ) but he always gets mad at me for having symptoms 

Yells at me for talking to much/asking questions and now I’m deathly afraid of asking questions to people especially in cars because he yells at me in the car the most and almost crashed because he was occupied while yelling

^^^^^^

Just a few things that my dad does that confuse me a bit, I might do another post with more things but I didn’t wanna make it too long



"
"I’ve (26F) been no contact with my father (44M) for 6 years now but found out two days ago that he has been sexually abusing his girlfriend’s kids. The girl that my dad has been sexually abusing has apparently been in and out of rehab and mental institutions and just barely turned 18. He has been in this girls life since she was 12 years old. Her sisters described an incident in which they walked in on my father with his pants down and his hands in her underwear as she was sleeping. My father had raped my mother repeatedly in her sleep towards the end of their marriage so this was not entirely news to me. I never thought my dad was capable of sexually abusing a minor like that and it has made me question my childhood. When I first started to try and have sex I realized that I have a sexual disorder called vaginismus, which could stem from sexual abuse. I have no recollection of being sexually abused as a child, but with all that has transpired I’m starting to think my dad may have hurt me as well. My heart hurts for the girls that he has sexually abused and I hope they are able to press charges. I’m not sure how to come to terms with the guilt I feel, as if there was anything I could have done to stop him from hurting others. If you have had something similar happen, how did you come to terms with it?"
"Here are some of the comments my mother LOVES to make:
- You’re nothing without me
- Nobody will ever love you like me
- Nobody will be there for you except me
- No one will ever love you like that (talking about my physical appearance)
- I’ve done EVERYTHING for you
- I have given up my life for you


Whenever I do something she doesn’t like, she either tells the pastor of our church, my friends, and/or says things like:
- You can’t leave (the house) cuz if you ever leave, you’ll be leaving in disobedience and God does NOT act in disobedient children.
- You should always honour your parents.

Currently, my a/c is the only functioning a/c in the house. She sleeps in my bed and I sleep in a mattress on the floor.

She always twists the narrative so that she’ll be the victim in every situation.
So, for example, if I say:
“Today was tiring at work.” 
She’ll start ranting like:
“You should see me. You can at least sleep 10 minutes (I can’t), but I can’t. I have to do this and that, etc.” (keep in mind that I currently have two jobs, she has one; but even if I only had one job, it’s not a competence of who has it worse in my opinion).

She will also make lies and make them so believable that even she will start believing them.

- How dare you say that? I have NEVER told you that.
- That NEVER happened.
- You misunderstood the situation.
- You’re right! Everything is MY fault and I am a terrible mother. The worse mother ever.

Am I overthinking things or is she really manipulating me/gaslighting me?

"This will be a long read I'm sorry and formatting might be terrible sorry
I'm trying not to break down crying what I write this

My mom was also abused as a child I'll make the short but she got pregnant Young and her mother got pregnant very young fat my mother was raised to buy other people except for grandmother she also wants thought physical abuse and Parentification

As far as I can think back before I was 10 my mother would use Corporal punishment the problem was not the hit when I did wrong be how far she would go it would leave mark and sometimes I would bleed. I DON'T KNOW THAT'S A I REALLY REMEMBER what's that she thought I a child under the age of 10 smaller then her in both high and weigh ( she is obese I was a little overweight) try to push her I didn't do Such a thing and she pushed me so hard that I hit my head well she was still hiting me with her favorite belt (it was leather and had a key at the end of it that how to fake diamonds in it which was most likely made of glass), when I was 12 I was walking behind her try to get my phone back through communication she turn around tackled me down and when I tryed to push her off she Bit my index finger the day after my principal found out as I had an emotional breakdown she was close to call him the CPS of my country I don't remember what I said but I somehow confinster that it was a fine. Her favorite punishing was kicking me out of the house I was not even a pretty when she's not in kicking me out for things such as leaving something on the floor you keep me out for hours or even a day and I would have to cry to some random neighbor to please let me stay under the roof she also did this recently about a year ago and this time I was actually willing to leave the house I was close to running away until she decided to play the victim I'm giving the head of myself sorry she will often searching me or shame me for overeating any times I could just stop eating purposely try to get anorexia because I thought mom would like me better and she would constantly act like this to other people as well she would make fun of people that are really skinny or just smaller then her either by saying that the person looks like they do cheated wall and then practically Force feeding them whenever they come to our house stating that someone is a pig and because I lived with her the longest and I stayed without the longest I got most of these ones, when I was a kid there was a specific neighborhood I would have to go there was a lot of ""weird people"" for example after age I started puberty very early I had D cup at the age of 11 a man straight up ask me how much it would be to buy me for marriage (to be more specific it's a cultural thing where the husband gets the bride's family a specific amount of money to be able to marry the woman) this incident was the first time actually so my mom doing something really amazing for me there was also another guy double creep me out and say really suggestive comments my mounted nothing about that guy constantly just said he needs help and let it alone until my uncle decided to take it into his own hands. On the time when I was I think about 12 I was interested in adult books I would listen to the audiobooks and one day my mother found out instead of telling me that this was not okay to do at my age she decided to also tell me that she was r worded honestly make me so disgusted off sex that I would want to vomit if I thought of it. Now on it starts to get worse at 13 I had to do home schooling because my mom was relocating I was losing my friend it's not to tell my mom that I hate it to a random I started reconnecting with my also abusive father the funny thing is my mom calls him abusive but they also have the same personality are you eventually just cutting off due to something so you decided and by I decided my mom decided and the things he did was to my mom try to make her pay for his other children's things he has 7 children including me yes he did sleep around since then I never had a good mental health I constantly contemplated ending things and I constantly had the chance to this time I was in hospital for a it's significant growth in my brain the only way I could communicate with friends what's through messaging and emails that because I was not allowed to have those things due to the growth I lost content with almost all my friends except for one for so long i had no one and my mother never made things better everyday she would start a fight and even if you keep quiet and don't respond to her she would continue degrading you there was a hair stylus double come to my house and she would stay for just 2 days she must have my sister saying that my mom is straight up abuser and she wants to cut her of my mom will constantly diagnose me a psychological liar a sociopath a narcissist and tell me that I'm the abusive one she would hate me to the point where we can turn to Black and Blue one day she found out that I've been trying to kill myself she tries to help me out and I try to build a better relationship between us think so seem to be going well and so she decided to say that ""you just  trying to kill yourself because I had punished you I'm just trying to raise you to become a good person"" that was the day I realized I do not have a mother I try to kill myself because I've been pulling my whole life I lost all my friends I don't have friends I recently had to cut off my dad and it's not worse because one of the side effects for a pill I am taking what's literally thoughts of self-harm. she have to making me feel like a sorry excuse for human being by saying that I didn't tell the psychologist anything about her doing all these terrible things cuz I was afraid that CPS will take me she said that I wanted them to take me fast from repeat she declined and I haven't had therapy in one year now I can feel myself slowly regressing and losing all the work I put in for my mental health what makes things even back to the reason kicking out incident but happened a year ago the whole human started with her stating that maybe you deserve to be bullied turn to dad then she said I'm catching you out of my house because you decided you can be your own parent I leave and I try to go to my sister's dormitory she eventually find out that I'm talking to my sister and trying to get there and she starts playing up the water works she only wanted me to come back I'm so that I can give her the things that I took with me which was my laptop and my phone tell me eventually had a conversation and I'm told her that she is emotionally unavailable as well as the fact that she is a workaholic and excuses always that she has to save lives ( nursing manager the two nursing managers at the hospital). There was more I should have mentioned but every time I brought something up she would twist actually I just went to my room and then she decided to call family members and say that I thought she was that and fake tears. That was also the day I found that she would tell family members about how terrible of a child I am even though those family members do not think I'm horrible person she was twist a stories and say ""all I'm trying to do is raise her I'm a single parent you know"" even more to mention she always drinks alcohol everyday sketches always a very mean when she drinks alcohol as well as the faction ever has time for her children because of work and outside she is but she has time for everyone else. She's financially abusive towards my sister my sister's not blooded towards me but rather make you a adult adoption  originally cheat not believe that was abusers this is not my story to tell but I would just say that you promises to pay something back you pay for it you do not keep the money back but you use your lost money for that cycle continues oh she would take away the money that you search you would pay you back because she did not like that you said no you can't do this I'm currently in a private school I originally came from public schools everyone at that school is rich and honestly they make fun of you for everything I don't like it there and I hate the fact that I only have one okay friend and she doesn't even talk to me that much  everyone else is not even a genuine friend 
who is just like bully and I have to deal with them because there's only seven children in my class


Recently today she beats me I'm so badly that my left and right arms what numb and red for the past the couple hours why did she hate me because I do not say mom at the beginning of every sentence I say it as the second word  and she officially said that I realize I don't have a child you dripping like a ghost and outreach you like a ghost you always have food and water but just never talk to me and honestly I never felt any emotions about that I'm happy and she decided that I'm not a daughter anymore cuz a long time ago I realized that she was not my mother but just the person I have to deal with for 18 years 

My plan
As soon as I turn 16 out of sign up for a job my school is really close to a shopping center and it gas station so I can try get it more time job over there my mom has my savings card so I have to try by the way to get paid either in cash or something this is for me to save up for Law school or just in case I have to redo a year cuz I truly believe that at 18 she will believe I will no longer be her responsibility if  worst come to worst I'll just join the army . By I will cut her off 
Edit
I want that I could have asked to let me stay with her she's in a different city and she already has two kids which is the only thing I'm worried about but I would want 100% get important job so that she doesn't have to worry too much about me"
"Me (F17) so quick story me and my pal where messing around at the bus station and just tagging the place up and my ex boyfriend which is very abusive and manipulative, he saw me and my pal at the bus station just tagging up the place we started shouting his name my pal had his bike so he went and spat on him, I herd him shouting and chasing after me he grabbed me by the wrists very hard and started screaming and threatening me in my face. And then he told me dad he told me to come home and get my stuff and said I'm not allowed to come back and am kicked out. And he was saying I'm never allowed to come back I'm the worst daughter and I should die etc. and when I got out the door he slammed the door and told me to fuck off and never come back. So I got the last bus to my mum's, which was 2 long coach journeys 1 was mostly on the A9 good citylink bus I have to say had a working toilet and USB. I thought my mum's was going to be okay until she started screaming and threatening to kick me out if I never cleaned her mess and do dishes I arapently made when it was hers. She was constantly keeping me awake blasting music when being drunk she was a violent drunk she hit me and threatened to kick me out and locked me out, not letting me see friends and wanting me to avoid Dundee, it's only safe city if yk it well. But I did take a overdose and a few days later she told me aunt she's kicking me out and talking shit behind my back. My aunt said shes kicking me out, so I went mental at her told her to fuck off. Packed my things and left. She followed me to the bus stop she is a slow walker (am fast at walking) I was walking to the bus stop but missed the bus but waited 7 mins for another one, got on the bus seen my mum trying to get me off the bus but I told her to fuck off. She reported me missing not even 3 minutes on the bus polis pulled my bus over by the train station on a main road. And I had no place etc. so I asked my pal to stay with her and I'm staying their the now. Her mum is a foster carer been living here for a month happier and safer down here.

 But people are telling me my dad is wanting me to go back to his and arapently he didn't kick me out and he said wanted me to leave for abit, ive blocked both parents and idk what to do"

Hello everyone am a 19 year old female and I grew up in an extremely toxic household. In the past and up till now I have tried to take my own life many countless times. By intaking pills and cutting myself. My parents are very aware of this and reply with go ahead take your life, in other works they do not care one bit.we had the police knock on our door saying we heard abuse goes on in this house but me and my siblings where forced to stay silent and say nothing to them. My brother has previously ran away but came back after two days.my father hits me regularly, does not let me go out, talk to friends or anything. I have not had a mobile phone up until recently and could not have a social life with my school friends. This is only the surface of tube story in real life it’s so much worst and pretty much hell , despite that I tried living with it the best I could until my parents forced me into a marriage with a 40 year old man, he looks older than my own father. I pleaded with my parents so much crying on my knees and they refused no for an answer, they said you either marry him or go back to our home country and marry someone worse. I asked them to atleast show me his pictures and they refused instead they showed me his picture when he was in his 20s. When knowing I could not escape this I was slowly convincing myself and seeing he was a good guy until I realised what good is there in a guy that had an eye on me since I was 15 and can see I am very unhappy with the marriage. So I was forced to get married and now we are married on paper , I have received my dowry of 4k worth of gold but we have not yet moved in together or spoke properly. Forgot to mention that he speaks our native language which I barely understand and has a humour of a literal granpa. 
So I have had enough and I am deciding to run away with the dowry money that I have. If I ever get caught I will probably and literally be killed and beheaded for shaming the family. I don’t know where to go yet from the uk and how I am going to live. I don’t really want to live so I either run away and unalive myslef here or in another country. Am writing to hear any of ur experiences running away and what u needed and didn’t need. 
Also I am planning to go somewhere really far outside Europe if u know any cheap living English speaking countries let me know please and wish me luck.

"Hello,

I am f23 and unfortunately come form a long line of child domestic violence. My cousins family is no acceptation to this. She is a sassy little 14 y/o and I love her so much. She reminds me of my own sisters and we have gotten pretty close as of late. I have noticed that her family scapegoats her, gaslights her, and emotionally abuses her. Recently, she opened up to me about how her sister s\*xually abused her. I told her about my history with s\*xual abuse in my family and it was a really tender moment for both of us. I know that her brother and mom know about it so I assumed that her older sister did. She told me about how her and her sister that abused my 14 yo cousin will be moving in together. I expressed how I was uncomfortable with that and accidently let slip the their biggest family secret. My little cousin just called angry telling me that I betrayed her and not to report it. I am torn and did not want to betray her trust but at the same time I want her to get the help she needs with this. I know she struggles with it on a day to day basis. I am sad at the fact she is so angry with me. Any advice?"
"To start off, this talks about very serious issues I have been dealing with regarding my feelings and relationship with her. So read if you want. 

I genuinely do not love my mom. I know it is so evil saying this, but I do not love my mom. My parents divorced when I was 4, resulting in me going to my dads every weekend and coming home to my mom on weekdays. My earliest memories are of my dad leaving me with a new woman every weekend because of his serial cheating issue. He also became an alcoholic, leaving me at Kids Quest a lot to stay at the bar. As I grew older he began drinking more and coming home wasted, which made me have to take care of my younger siblings by lying saying he was just so exhausted from work, etc. One day in California, he got really drunk and got physical with a family member. I had to hide my siblings and I in the bathroom while he tried to find us to drive back home (a different state.) But even after all of this, I understood addiction is a nasty leech and knew that he loved us, he was just hurting.  Eventually, He found a nice woman and introduced us to her and her kids, and have been together for years since. He got better and doesn’t drink nearly as much anymore, and genuinely seems at peace. After all of that, I don’t hate him, I love him. Yeah we don’t really talk when I go over anymore but that’s just because I grew up completely different than him and we don’t have a lot to talk about. But I still love him. My mom was evil to me growing up. I remember being a kid and having suicidal thoughts, like, around age 8. I got severely depressed at 11, resulting in me going to therapy and psychologists. I was too scared to begin medication so I chose not to, and because of that, I blamed me lacking love toward her on that for so long. I know that is not the case. There were days when she’d care so much and make sure I’m ok, then the next scream at me and make me cry all night, causing me to go to ALL OF middle school with puffy eyes. She also had gotten physical with me, kicking me once and screaming at me to get out the house and how she doesn’t love me. She had kicked me out about 4 times, just to call me crying saying she didn’t mean it, which made me feel terrible for moving. The thing is, even through all of that, even through my mom somehow forgetting how to parent after she had already had two kids, I knew deep down somewhere in there that she loved me. I loved her at that point too. The verbal and occasionally physical abuse continued, we fought every single day. The cycle kept repeating. Fight, scream, slap, threaten, then an apology in asking me if I want to go shopping (which I figured out as I got older would just be to use against me). Because even though she did all of that, she loved me and was patient with me sometimes.  I started to hate her. I’d hear her wake up and get anxious, making me walk upstairs. I hated when she’d call me, felt deeply DEEPLY uncomfortable when she’d touch me or enter  my room, and not even because I was scared but because my body just reacted that way. Even her kind moments started to not matter. Her hugs, kisses, kind messages meant nothing to me because of all the bad. I had opened up to my stepdad about it, telling him how I am scared of losing the motive to better my relationship with my mom and how I was scared that I’d stop caring, and he told me it’s just a teenager thing. I am 18, still feeling this way. When I speak to her, I feel like I am acting. My littlest sister (on my dads side) is at the age where I first started acting up , and though she has her annoying moments I find her so easy to love. I don’t understand why or how my mom was so evil to me and feel so shitty because nobody understands me and says to stop holding a grudge. It isn’t a grudge, I can’t get out of this and I think im at a point where I am truly done. 

How do I heal? How do I not hate her guts and wish she wasn’t around ?

"Ten years ago when my little girls were 10 and 12, there was an incident at my parents house. My mother is an alcoholic and in a tantrum she had convinced my girls that I had hit her. I was healing up a broken leg and the girls were visiting me at their house from out of state. Immediately after this happened my parents put them both on a plane and sent them home to their mother (my ex wife)..and news that I had assaulted my mother spread throughout everyone in my life instantly. I could not defend myself because there were too many people involved who saw benefit in supporting this version of the story. It was like that by my mothers design to begin with. Now ten years later one of my daughters has reached out to me, but reconnection is on my mothers terms because she has held on to her influence over her. The moment I expressed any anger, my daughter immediately said I wasn't ready and blocked me again. We were so close and happy before this lie was told, and I have a really hard time accepting that everyone still thinks I assaulted my mother, and that I should be thankful to her for the chance to reconnect. I have missed them so much and missed out on so much in their lives. I don't expect my mother to apologize or set the matter straight, and her terms seem like they have been set for my failure ...further reinforcing her hold. I have no support on my end and I am struggling with how to handle the situation on my own. I can't take advice from anybody who doesn't believe me because it doesn't lead me to a solution. Thank you for reading my post."
"(copied and pasted from another sub bc i didnt get responses there)

It's been on my mind. I was previously emotionally abused by someone else in the past (PTSD after effects) but I can't bring this subject up to my therapist. I don't want something to happen. Like I said, I've been thinking about it for a while. For some context, I'm 17. Sorry if this is a weird post, I just need to ask someone. Ask questions, I'll answer.

When I was growing up, I think I was physically abused. Not to a terrible extent. Just some bad experiences. Like my mom used to put me under really cold water in the bathtub, kinda half drowning me. She'd also use to beat me. She once beat me so hard at the one sleepover I had as a kid I wasn't able to breathe. That and some other stuff. No permanent scarring, though. I remember scratching ""mommy hurts us"" into a bed frame. She'd also use to berate me in front of people, not sure why. I remember not getting an award from elementary school and she brought it up to my teachers and called me a failure or something. I know my dad told me he takes this tobacco things because he's stressed. Because of me? He also called me and my brother ""a little shit"" growing up. I remember my mom hit me with a knife and told me it was my fault for being bad. Anyways, I think... I think I was abused while growing up? I'm not sure.

During covid, so like my pre-teen years, it was kinda hellish. My parents and my brother would fight a lot and it would get physical. My brother is younger than me, so I guess it's weird they'd do that. They'd tell me and him to kill ourselves and whatever. I try not to remember. I wanted to run away and get emancipated and stuff like that. I remember telling and showing my friends an experience and their reaction was them being extremely off put. This was around the time of when I was getting abused by the previously mentioned person, so my memories are kinda bad. Sorry. I'll try to remember and add onto this.

I remember that when I was starting therapy and stuff my doctor asked if my parents were abusing me. She asked if I was scared of them and stuff like that. I answered no.

My mom is pretty much verbally abusive. I'm not sure about emotionally, she's never told me she was going to kill herself if I didn't do something. She did tell me growing up she wanted to kill herself because of me, though. I don't know if that counts. I've had some weird experiences with my parents, I guess. I know they can be weird sometimes. I'll pull up lists of abusive traits and see if that jogs my memory.

* ""Constant belittling, shaming, and humiliating."" Yeah. My mom does this. To her I'm just a failure. I remember a couple days ago when she saw me bring something to my room (which she assumed was to hurt myself with) she laughed and asked about the scars and was just laughing about it.
* ""Calling names and making negative comparisons to others."" She did this earlier today, I think. I'm ""aloo"", a potato, zero. She says I make her look bad in comparison to other people and their children.
* ""Telling a child they’re “no good,” “worthless,” “bad,” or “a mistake.”"" Begrudgingly, yeah. I'm a bad child, to my parents. Maybe I am? But that's something for another day.
* ""Limiting physical contact with a child—no hugs, kisses, or other signs of affection."" Probably just our asian culture, this doesn't happen. But it's also weird how my dad doesn't really say ""I love you"", my mom does sometimes. Maybe that's just asian culture though.
* ""Exposing a child to violence against others, whether it is against the other parent, a sibling, or even a pet."" Yeah, to my brother. He has it worse.
* ""never saying anything kind, expressing positive feelings or congratulating a child on successes"" Yeaaah... I won an award for something a little bit ago and my mom was mad that I only got one award.
* ""shaming"" a bit vague but I would say a little bit. My mom does this in front of my friends and kinda always has.
* ""Blaming"" also vague but helllll yeah. its all my fault, i guess ive internalized it enough to actually believe it though lol
* ""Ridiculing"" i dont think this comes from a place of love.

Also they're kicking me out as soon as I turn 18, if that means anything. Maybe that's just american culture?  
My parents can be nice sometimes, I guess. I used to cry to her a little. Maybe like four times in the last couple of years? They pay for my stuff and let me live with them. My room is full of stuff. I don't think I'm neglected.

I've told one of my friends about this. He thinks I'm being abused and says I'm excusing my parents behaviors and stuff.

When I see other parents, I feel so weird. My parents aren't like that. I think I described other parents as ""so nice"" in comparison to mine. Like, actually caring about your feelings? That's actually so crazy.

Anyways yeah, ask me questions and i'll answer. I don't know if i should add more or less? Thanks for reading"
"I don't wanna seem like I'm being dramatic, but she threatens to kill me if I call CPS or Childline, she blames all her problems on me, ridicules me and insults me, ignores my emotions, tricks me into feeling bad, hits me when I did nothing while she's mad, yells and screams at me, etc, etc. She also tells me ""I'll give you something to cry about"" and keeps making me cry, it happens nearly every day. She sometimes forgot to feed me when I was younger, argues with my uncle then takes her anger out on me, sometimes she still doesn't feed me, but I can cook now."
"For context, I’ve been going to this church for +10 years and I started singing in the worship team when I was 14.
For extra context, I live with a very emotionally and verbally abusive mother who knows how to manipulate the narrative and always makes herself the victim, even in situations that are not from her life (this will be important later).

In the Pandemic, my mother exploded.
My stepfather and I would have 2 weeks of peace AT MOST and then she would get very aggressive and impulsive for around two weeks as well, and then she would get very depressed, threatening to take her life if we ever left her. 
My church leaders knew about this because at that time, I couldn’t afford a therapist and I just needed someone to talk to. I thought I could trust them.

Fast forward to last year (2023), and it all came crashing down for me. I started feeling like I didn’t belong in the worship team anymore and I felt alone because they spoke awfully about mental health issues.
On my side, I got tatted and I will admit that I knew it was against our doctrine but I honestly felt so at peace with myself and with my spirit, and I don’t believe I’ve sinned against God.
But then, I went to church and they told me every comment and insult that you guys can imagine.
That I was too emotional and impulsive.
That I should keep quiet whenever I didn’t like something about the church because I was speaking badly about the bride of Christ.
That I wasn’t the example they wanted kids to follow.
They weren’t sure I was fit to be a mother even though I was “biologically ready” (I’m 24. To bring a child in this economy and world!? Sir, please).
And they KNOW I’m sensible to words because of YEARS of verbal and emotional abuse from my mother.

I later got to know that they had meetings about me without me (including my mother) in which they talked about me, debated on whether to let me stay on the worship team or not, what they were going to do with me, etc.

My mother had some influence in there and even though they HAVE SEEN physical proof, and heard recordings and videos of how she treats me, they chose to believe whatever it is that she told them (to this day, I don’t know what it was).


I started going to the psychiatrist a few months ago and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
My psychiatrist also recommended that I change churches and, if things became too bad with my mother, proceed legally.
I feel so lost and scared and I don’t know what to do. I left the worship team even though I loved singing and praising Jesus.
And I also love my mother. I know that she can be a good person, but it is so hard to love her that it hurts.
It’s like hugging a rose with thorns and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells every day.

Am I in the wrong?"
"I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (we are both in our early 20s) for almost 2 years now. She has been wonderfull to me the whole time, and I don't think I know anyone more underestanding and open in my life, she is incredibly smart and amazing at getting how and why people feel or act in certain ways.

She comes from an average home, some stuff hasn't been great, but generally her parents are good people, and have give her a sense of safety, she counts on them and talks to them all the time, and she trusts them to tell them issues she deals with.

I on the other hand, come from a bit of a complicated situation. My parents have been, for as long as I can remember, psycologically, verbally (heavy on this one) and sometimes even phisically (not very common) abusive to me. Our relationship has gotten a lot better the past year, and I can't say I hate them for what they did to me. I've been going to therapy for around 2 years as well, and only recently started really digging into the abuse, and realizing how wrong it really was.

I came to the realization a few weeks ago that I want to tell my girlfriend, if not all of it at least enough that she can truly underestand what's so wrong with me. Im fucked in the head and I've known that for a long time, but I feel like if I don't explain myself a little, she will never truly underestand the reason why raised voces scare me, why I cry when a stupid movie shows a good parents, why I panic when something gets dropped/broken/spilled. 
There is also the matter that I recently realized I don't know how to tell when someone is being violent if they aren't yelling and hitting. My therapist says that's because I register anything below that as safe due to how I grew up. But I find that very scary, I'm afraid I might have been violent without realizing, or that I will be at some point. She usually is very quick to tell me when something bothers her, and she has been an angel with that, because I'm not the quickest to underestand social things, but she always takes the time to make sure I got it, and I always try my best to better myself for her, she deserves only the best. But it's a scary thought nonetheless. 

I've been thinking that I should tell her about all this, or at least a part of it, so that we can keep building a healthy relationship, and also because sometimes I feel like I'm miles away because I can't explain what's going on in my head. Im unsure as to how or when, and an irracional part of me is scared to death that she will think I'm exagerating, or won't believe me. My therapist said it would be best to discuss it after Im done healing, but I honestly don't feel confortable just ignoring the elephant in the room completly. Ive made some coments here and there before, so she already knows I wasn't raised quite right. 

I just wanted to vent a bit and hear you all if anyone has some advice or ideas




(It's my first time posting in this subreddit so if Im breaking any rules please let me know) "
"I guess it's kinda logical after me refusing contact  for nearly 2 years. But I'm still mad.

She still had a way to give them to me through my dad but decided to rather make a quick buck of it. Some of the things are expensive video games and books I cherish very much. I couldn't take everything with me and knew I would never see them again. But actually knowing there's no way of getting them back is crushing me.

Update: I did something stupid and messaged her on a burner account telling her that instead of selling my belongings she should give them my dad. I also told her no matter if she accepts it, she abused me and that no contact is the best for both of us.

I know this was extremely stupid. Emotions were too high. There's no way to delete the message. I don't know what I should do. I guess I have to fess up to my dad since they will probably contact him. But I'm too afraid having to confront my emotions and my weakness."
"I am grown up man not good with social setting 
I think my family try to embarrssingn me on puropse,
i was just sit with my dad he immediately says about me negative comments , he exactly said you look more hondsome and then told me my hair is very long and there is dark spot in my feet
I got the same behavior with young brother same attitude for example i say something funny , he says 'he is smart!' Sometimes both try to  humilate me in family gathering 
Like my brother shouted loud out of nowhere that i spent 3 years jobless and looking for a job in family gathering
I just dont react what is the best thing to answer for this kind of behavior

"I am currently 27(F) and I just moved out of my abusive household. My family was both physically and emotionally abusive, more so emotionally as I got older. The constant put-downs never really stopped even just a month ago. My mom does love me but she says awful things like telling me to die when she’s upset, and this has been said to me my entire life. I don’t speak to my dad or my brother because they are the same exact people. Walking around my home felt like eggshells, because I was constantly being judged and criticized for being a normal adult woman. My father hated the fact that he could not control me and did not show me respect. He has called me a wh0re for wearing a normal black dress. My brother learned to treat me badly because of my dad. The depression and anxiety got so bad that I was thinking heavily about suicide. 

Now that I am finally free, I don’t think I’ve fully processed it yet until now and it’s been 3 days to be exact. I guess I feel safe. More free to be myself, without any criticism.

"Many of my (27M) abusive experiences took place while eating in family at the kitchen table. One of the phrases I remember the most from my father is ""seeing you eating grosses me out"". Until my teen years, I was frequently scolded, screamed at and even physically hit during meals, for being a ""picky eater"". I was literally afraid of eating with my family.

This caused me several problems with food. This is not the first time I'm opening a thread about this. But one problem in particular that I've only noticed frequently, is that I seem to get some sort of anxiety or panic attack when somebody gives me a more or less ""dedicated"" meal, and I don't eat it for not liking it. It has happened to me at least three times in the last one or two years: once with friends, once at my job, and once at a restaurant.

I grew up receiving nothing but violence for just saying I didn't like the food I was given. And up to this day. it looks like I still react with fear when I reject food.

I wonder, is this just me? Does somebody else suffers or suffered from something similar?"
"I finally see it - that family that's doing things the RIGHT way. There's no guilt, no parentification, no anger, no harm, but there's love, compassion and understanding. The kids get in trouble, but the parents take the time to EXPLAIN why they're in trouble and what they should have done differently. 

  
I know I don't see what's going on behind closed doors after I leave their home, but it's shocking to see how HAPPY they are. I've told them they're good parents, but I don't think they believe me. How do I explain it better without burdening them with my own trauma? They're insightful, I'm pretty sure they've guessed already."
"I'm 23 years old. Ever since I was young I was under constant abuse with my mother. She's manipulative, She's a liar, and she victimizes herself in every situation. She religiously tortured me by showing me grotesque images of people being murdered when I was just 11 years old. She held a vacuum above my head acting like she was going to hit me with it. She told me she had dreamt punching me in the face over and over again. She would squeeze my face as a child. She would stick her thumbs into my eyes. She would yell in my ear. When I was in fourth grade I broke at school and cried to the school that my mother was abusing me. And when they confronted her she cried  crocodile tears and lied to them and they believed her and made me look like a fool. I am so sick of being in this life. Knowing that this woman exists. She is a pure embodiment of evil thinking she is good.I hate her. I hate her so much. Not even the infinite cosmos of this infinite universe could match a fraction of the hatred I have towards the drifting thought of her. "
"So my parents lied about me and they let some weird stranger in and I got raped. Then I was mishandled by the hospital a few times and got stuck with a dirty needle. 

Edit: It might be cousin or an old friend. They are too gullible. I just dont know but it wpuld make sense of how they got in then other ppl got in.
I know they issues.  I haven't seen them in a while."
"I can handle having conflicts with outside people; I can handle being in verbal, heated arguments with someone but when it comes to my mom insulting me, using my weaknesses or flaws against me, my god, it's such a sour pill to swallow to know that I can't even confide anything of my personal life to my mom in fear of her using it against me. I've always thought family is meant to help each other become stronger, to help each other overcome obstacles, not to tear each other apart over every mistake. Maybe I'm still too naive, if I can't even put my trust in my own family member, who else can I trust? I'm sorry for venting. If someone is dealing with abusive parent(s), I hope you still hang in there, keep going & become stronger. It sucks so bad, I know"
"They are like the smartest people I know yet do and say the most ignorant and oblivious things. My Dad put hands on me unjustly period. He doesn't usually do that but he still did it, multiple times, and my mom at times too. So I go to the counselor, not to call CPS, literally just vent. She listens to me and then files a report without my knowledge. You don't even have a say in it like that yet my mom LOVES blaming this on me.

That is literally the reason they came and my dad wants to be like ""well you should've come initiated conversation about religion and LGBTQ shit"" cuz I left and i'm bi with me WHILE JUST IGNORING THE FACT THAT HE PUT HE TOSSED A COMPUTER AT ME AND HIT ON ME MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHT MULTIPLE MONTHS ON N OFF now the cops sent some mail n stuff and my mom months earlier got a call bout the CPS people ""escalating"" this. I don't even think my dad is abusive ig? But he has done some abusive stuff, and i've said that multiple times. The thing is, they don't listen to me so it kept happening, on and off but it happened. Not even that too, it was just mentally taxing even talking to them bout this religious stuff Then they just blame it all on me.

Edit: Watching this vid on gaslighting and they're literally doing that. Making me feel small and literally trying to change reality. Like they keep blaming MY actions for why they keep when in reality the counselor listened to what I was telling her, which was me just explaining what happened,. Not some cry for help and yet they insist that it was my fault. Were also black so he brings that into it and the system which is valid but then tells me how I'm trying to work with the system implying he knows more about it even though they keep blaming me for this. LIKE I DON'T WANT TO TALK BOUT HOW U THINK BEIN TRANS IS WEIRD AND HOW ME NOT BEING APART OF ANY RELIGION IS WEIRD. I told them my opinion, they have told me there's. Now I really don't want it now and they WON'T respect that. I'm 17 and I still live with them and that's even more tricky cuz now they feel like they own me, or get the right to treat me however or say whatever. 

I don't know what to do, even my peoples don't know, some of em even abandoned me not even listening to me."
"I’ve just graduated high school so I feel like I can say more now than I could before, but is my dad abusive?

I believe myself that he is verbally abusive, manipulative, a narcissist, and mentally and emotionally abusive. 
I think it kind of started after he came back from the military, I mean he’s always been strict but never to this extent. He has said a lot of things so called “out of anger” like how he wanted to strangle me, how if he has the option to not deal with my sister he wouldn’t have had he at all, how if we wanted to kill ourselves we should just do it and get it over with so he can clean up the mess.

And he says he doesn’t mean it in that way? What otter way can we take that coming from our dad? 
My father has only ever worked his whole life so he tries to get us to help around the house, which I had no issue with until he started just nagging. It was something I wasn’t doing right every time, I didn’t clean the kitchen the right way, I don’t cook enough, I don’t consider peoples feelings, and not even with chores in the house! I’m a kind of curvy girl and all he can ever tell me is how far I’m going to get if I don’t work out (I do) or how ugly my back looks in some dresses! He even said I looked funny in my prom dress????
This morning he came to blame me about protein powder assuming I used it all and started hurling remarks at me when he was the one who used it last? I really can’t take it anymore, especially after my sister got in trouble for liking a boy and my dad told her he would only want to get in her pants and LIFTED HER SHIRT TO POINT AT HER BOOBS?? He yelled at her that boys would only want that from her, she was wearing no bra.

I don’t care if he is my dad but that should have never happened, we are girls and he is a man! That much self respect should be in his head but it isn’t! I haven’t even mentioned him throwing a knife and glass shard at my sister and me telling us to kill ourselves infront of him (we wanted to at one point) and slamming me against my dresser one time just because I was journaling my thoughts.
He does this thing where he forgets stuff on purpose to make us feel dumb or stupid about what we reminded him about too, and it’s used on our mother too. If it’s not his way then it’s no one’s way.

A lot of our “acting out” was triggered by him. He was the reason I tried to run away, cut myself a little the start of high school, and developed really bad depression. Though I can never just talk it through with him.
So is he abusive?"
"I've lived with my dad for my dad for as long as I been on this earth. As much as I'd love to get away from him and move into my own place for my own sanity, I can't. So the next best thing I do is avoid him and try to do my own shit.  
I really feel he has had a huge negative effect on my psyche on how I've become as a human being. He is the typical machismo alpha tough guy who feels like he is the leader in everything. He is always right, and is not willing to discuss or debate ANYTHING. He is often always angry. If not at me, but at other things. But since I am forced to live with him I often come under his abuse. When he confronts me I don't argue. I avoid making eye contact, and just say yes and sorry to everything he says. But nothing I do other than being gone is enough to satisfy him. He even said once I am only around because of my mom who he seems to reserve his only compassion for. He will even get unnerved and jealous if I show my mom care and mimic me like an overgrown schoolyard bully, and call me a weak mamma's boy. My brother was heavily abused by him too, and he grew up to be even worse than him. My dad will often drink wine and get very scary at night. Times when I've had to flee the house and drive away because he will invade my room and try to assault me, only for him to have no memory of it the next day. Refuses to apologize. He will drag my mom in and twist the situation of my presence being a cause for her stress, and imply I am slowly killing her.  
He often guilts and intimidates me saying I have no rights as long as I live under his roof. I want to get away but I have nobody to turn to. I am far too old to be treated like this. The only escape I have is to isolate myself in my room, temporarily drive off, or be at my job."
"my parents have always be neglectful but its so far rn im sick because of the black mold in the house im freaking out trying to make sure my cats are safe and they aren’t doing anything

"My stepmom when I was five made me walk from the city to the country like a 2-hour walk because she was mad at my dad I had blisters all over my feet my dad still stayed with her for a long time after that.



When I was a teenager and my dad finally broke up with but not really I would have to go to her house after school cuz he worked late and she would make my step brother who raped me as a child(I was 5 when that happened ) would make me sit on the steps outside of the house and leave to go see his friends  I didn't have a phone or anything to contact anybody so I was just outside for hours.


My stepmom every single chance she could get would tell me my bio mother hated me and chose drugs over me and that my biological brothers were horrible disgusting people and I should hate them and that my dad wasn't my real dad.



My stepmom when we would go outside would touch my private area sometimes.


She slapped me over remote control once because I wouldn't turn the TV off and I wouldn't give her my tablet( that my grandmother got me) to give to my brother cuz he broke his.


Would try to get my dad to spank me all the time constantly.


Would pretend I'd hit her so my dad would take her side and punish me.


Knew my step brother was sexually assaulting me and did nothing about it and told me to keep quiet and it was my fault.

I get paid about $400 a week, I know it’s basically a no but I’m desperate at this point and it would just be for 2 months until I’m back in college, could I maybe rent a motel or something? Is there anything I can do to live alone for the next two months?"
"For a while now my family always does petty shit, ask for a plum get a kiwi kind of stuff. Mostly my mother does it by knocking down my dead dogs pictures, she also intentionally makes bad food that she doesn't eat(but she'll go out later to eat). Now my dog had been hurt, he's drawing blood, and they do this to get me pissed off. I don't know what to do, all they do is petty abuse to get my reaction to make me seem like a bad guy. When I had said if something was to happen to my dog, somthing happened to him. But yet they say it was a coincidence,it wasn't. My parents are in this together"
"
Like two months ago, I searched for advice in my father because I was really afraid of my brother’s mental health (he had told me he was not ok) and as I dont have any source of income, I felt safe to talk to my father and tell him like, hey! we need a little money so we can pay for my brother’s therapy because he’s not okay right now. I thought he, you know, a mature adult, and instead of talking me down or something, he just started yelling at me some crazy shit, he told me we should off ourselves, he told me its all my fault, he told me im a devil and that’s why i’m “fat” and a lot of terrible things. He was yelling all of really near to my face and i decided to stand up and try to punch him far, I was desesperate, he is way taller and obviously stronger than me, and he sat me down in the matter of a second and started choking me with his hand around my neck, I couldn’t fucking breathe. My mother stepped between us and separated us. Who knows what could have happened if she wasn’t there. I dont talk to him, but my mother wants me to “let it slide”, she has tried to convince me he just made a mistake. Im extremely sad. I cant believe even my mother doesn’t care about my well being and it’s not mad that man did that to me. I cant leave my household because i cant afford renting or living on my own because im finishing my pre med degree and my mom pays for it. I love my mom, i just want to know what to do, i dont wanna give up my dreams just for my abusive dad but it breaks my heart in million little pieces when my moms tells me to just forget it. 

I really don’t want to give up on medicine. "
"Full Story: I was an introvert and anti-social so I hate going outside too long. My dad asked me to go to the park with him and my brother, I said I only want to be at home and want to play (because my parents think I'm addicted to my computer) and my dad ask what type of game (cards, domino, etc) and I didn't know because Domino was missing pieces and Cards were all gone so I couldn't say any, my dad became furious because I had said that thing a lot of time before, he start getting the broom and I know I'm done for when I see that and started rushing to the toilet, I stayed there for hours. While I was in there, he was breaking the door, like the door bended after the incident. Eventually, my dad gives up and start using his phones. Hours later, she wanted to go to the toilet and I told her to just  promise that you will not hit me then I will go but they denied then later my mom promise me that they will not hit me but she lied, my dad came rushing with the broom and hitting me, the force was too strong even the broom broke in half. After that, my dad ""strangle"" me and I can't breathe, so I hit him and he said I was hitting him while I'm trying not to die. He hit me more and more, my hands were injured. My shirt was almost ripped in half and he forced me to wash dishes while my hands have injuries, the skin was ripped off. And washing dishes with those hurt like my hands were burning. This story of mine shows that parents can be abusive because of their race (Asian), they always said that only hitting works on me while even their parents rarely even hit them. DM me if you want picture of injuries.
It was burning when I shower...

"He shouts at me a lot over small issues, and emotionally abuses me. Today when I was picking stuff off the floor, he hit me hard in the back. He continued to scream at me for minutes before storming off. My mum did nothing, and didn't check in on me. In fact she picked up a conversation with my dad and started laughing."

"My mom is not doing so well.  And I’m an adopted only child. For years it’s “oh well you can take care of me when I am older”.  I’m 39.  Solo and alone myself.  She is too. However. My entire child hood was her sick. Always some issue.  Real or not- every memory of something joyful in my life was ruined by her “being sick” which never came to real life.  When I was 5? She did have thyroid cancer. And I was left with other people. She left me to take care of her brother (which I commend) when I was 12-14.  She left me 2-5 to take care of her mom.  Any time something fun was planned - she’d make an excuse “no I have a headache” or she would check my room to make sure it was perfectly clean.  If there was one thing out of place- for example my first time planned to go to Disney- she was checking for anything out of place, and stubbed her toe. Cancelled the entire trip.  I was 10.  She cancelled things over and over again. Forced me
To quit track, soccer, anything I loved in high school but forced me to do music lessons.  Now years later at 39 denies she did that.  Every thing I do is wrong or awful in her mind. I’ve been dumped because of her and her controlling.  I get screamed at every week at 39 for things and I’m f*ing done. 

TLDR: I’m not taking care of my mom.  And I feel awful I have no feelings anymore.  My whole childhood was her being sick.  Real or fake.  I didn’t get a childhood. Now I’m planning to travel and live my life.  And she’s not going to stop it.  I feel sick I’m like this- but I’m done.  I’m just done being forced to live my life by her rules. "
"I’m really thinking about having an awkward but necessary talk with my whole family. I am 17(M) and my family drives me insane lets start with my mom, she has always held me back and been manipulative she never lets me go anywhere, and I am now 17, so there's no excuse now. I no longer like her, and she's always wondering why im rude to her and no longer like her (keep in mind I am not rude at all just very quiet) my grandma is even crazier she yells at me over little things like forgetting to throw away or clean something or scenarios where half of the things she could've done her self like seriously she calls me from the other room, and she does this thing where she makes me come instead of her coming to me and half of the time it will be something like turning off a light that she could've turned off herself It's not just that she's also very rude and physically abusive she hit me once for not closing the cap of a tube of toothpaste paste (that's never been a job for me ever and also its toothpaste) I have no dad however my grandpa is chill however he gave up on defending me from my grandma because she's so crazy, and they begin to argue whenever he defends me, and it gets scary even now they have never let me go anywhere with friends or do anything they constantly monitor me and watch me they don't trust me at home even though ill be doing the same thing while they're gone (nothing at all) someone always has to be at the house babysitting me while I bed rot all day against my will while they complain about how I stay in my bed all day and how lazy I am. I am an extrovert, so being inside all day is killing me. I don't know what to do. I can't do it anymore. I want to have a talk or intervene with them, but they are crazy and gaslight me as if I'm the problem. They treat me like I'm stupid and patronize me constantly. I am so patient and kind to them, despite their stupidity and rudeness. How should I go about talking to them? What should I do?"

"My life story (TW) 

This is my story. I’ve recently (on another account) been going around Reddit, and trying to help people (especially children) get out of abusive situations, and to help people learn how to cope with their past abuse. I’ve been getting questions on how do i know so much, and is it due to me having to deal with things in the past, and the answer is yes. I want to grow my charity (i guess that is what you would call) when I’m older so i can help more people. So here is my story.


My life started when my druggie of a mother and my alcoholic of father got together. And they had me. I was born deprived of the nutrients i needed, and for some reason the doctors thought this was okay and didn’t report my parents. I was dumped at relatives house and moved around for 3 years till i was shoved back into my parents house. And things just then got worse.


My parents attempted to put me in a sex trafficking ring for money, but the deal somehow didn’t work out and I was never officially put in. However, they later made me become an altar girl, and you know how that turns out. The priest molested me (about six months) until other parents took him to court, where he found not guilty on all charges.


My mother and father never got better. They laid off on the drugs slightly but they were still extremely abusive. At the age of three i was tied to my bed for 2 days and was beaten with belts and sticks, just because i scuffed my really old shoes. My mother has strangled me on numerous occasions. My father has molested and i strongly believe he has raped me (the memory is really fuzzy.) I was forced to work at the age of 10 so i could eat food. I was told the world would be better off if i died and that no one would care if i was gone. I was told I’m a cruel person, and that I’m ugly and stupid. I was beaten so much, altogether i have broken 36 bones. I have been put on drug runs for them, starting at the age of 4. They have attempted to drown me, poison me and more. They have sold my things on ebay and facebook so they can pay for expensive clothes and furniture.


At the age of 13, i moved out to my great aunts house. She was very very very poor and i went without eating some nights, but it was better than living with my parents. She was also very sick mentally and she would kick me out and bring me back in. I moved out again to my parents as i Was forced to, and she later died. When i was living with her my parents tortured and killed my cat.


At 14, i moved into my grandparents for about a month, until i was forced to go back with my parents. My grandparents never believed what i was saying, and blamed me for everything, saying i was insane, and ungrateful for what my parents did do right. At this point i had had enough and i went and reported my parents and family to the police and child services, for the abuse i had endured. 


I am now in a very long, brutal court case with against my family. Everyday, i am trolled and harassed  for speaking my story, by family, ex-friends and complete strangers on the internet. I am not sharing my story for sympathy points, as i have been accused of. I just want people to know that they are not alone. I’m still trying to heal from my past. I know what i was missing and want to give that to people that who need it. thank you to whoever is reading.

" Hello everyone,

I'm new here and I hope this post is appropriate. I'm an alienated mother, separated from my son since 2020. Currently, I'm enrolled in a doctoral program in forensic psychology, and I am conducting a study on parental alienation.

If you're a parent who has experienced alienation from your child or children, I would greatly appreciate your help by filling out this questionnaire. This study is very important to me, and your participation would mean a lot.

Thank you!

"At this point my dad's all but pulled out his dick and raped me. He's touched parts of me I haven't even touched, made me do things and say things so fucking violating and horrible it just feels like I have zero dignity around him now. He's stripped me of every shred of pride I have and now just because he's been forced into therapy and he's supposedly ""trying to change"" from the years of fucking abuse and violence and trauma I'm just supposed to be able to forgive him, and act normal around him, and pretend like he hasn't violated me physically and mentally. Like his presence doesnt forever remind me of the fact that his hands have been between my legs, and that whenever I tried to stop him I never could because I was too fucking afraid. And every time I remember how I let him do it and I let him touch me and hit me and violate me because I was too much of a fucking coward to tell him to stop, I just feel so ashamed. The fact that his threats are enough to make me just obey him like some mindless bitch and he just has so much control over me makes me want to throw up. And I don't know how to face him anymore knowing what hes seen and done, said to me and made me say and made me do. His presence feels like a reminder of how much control he has over me just because he threatens shit. 

The one time I tried to get him to stop all he needed to do was threaten to beat me up and I just shriveled and gave up. It's so ridiculously easy for him to do all this shit to me I'm a fucking joke. 

I'm not going to the police, or CPS. And I'm not gonna explain why not because it's really hard to explain. I just need to figure out how to forget all of this. "

"Hey, I just created this Reddit account just so I could ask this question.

I am a teen, about to enter adulthood, just graduated from high school.

Basically, my father always gets mad at me whenever I do something wrong, which while seeks normal, his triggers and reasoning is what is odd.

For some perspective, one time my father lashed out at me in a public restaurant because when I was trying to get my straw out of the paper I accidentally bent it.

I didn't have a reaction to bending the straw, it wasn't his straw, I wasn't a worker there fumbling my job or something, we were just eating dinner at a restaurant, and I did nothing that day to trigger him, everything was going well up to this point, he just got mad at me for accidentally bending my own straw.

This was no an occurrence that happened when I was really little or something, this happened earlier this year, so you can imagine how easily my dad gets triggered by my mistakes.

He would also yell at me for being nervous, which always seemed counterproductive to me, but maybe I'm wrong.

He would insult me, get mad at me for not wanting to spend time with him, and when I would try, he would continue the cycle.

And to be clear, I don't hate jokes towards me, I think it's perfectly good to have a friendly laugh at each other, but this wasn't that, he'd be putting me down and then get upset when I didn't want to be around him.

He'd hate it when I cry, which I guess I could understand, no one likes crying all the time, but what stuck out to me is that he told me, he would stop getting mad at me and start trying to solve problems calmly with me once I stopped crying.

So with time, I learned how to hold in my tears, but my dad didn't keep his word, he still got angry with me all the same, I kept trying until around my last two years of high school, now I just wait until I'm all alone to cry.

He also once threatened that if I ever got him sent to prison, once he got out, he would show me what it was like to get beat up, this was because he once got into trouble with the police because I was scared he was going to beat me up.

I did not intend for my dad to get in trouble with the police, but I was really scared, my dad never punched me, but he did spank me, once with a belt, I remember crying and begging him not to do it, and he would yell at me to turn around.

I was usually in trouble because of school, I am special needs and struggle with behavioral problems, but something I did notice was my behavioral problems were either better or worse depending on what teacher I had, my behavioral problems were at their worst when the teacher was a jerk, meanwhile when I got lucky and got teachers who were nice people, I did quite well in school.

It didn't help that my dad didn't even realize I was special needs until the third grade, but his temper didn't change, the only thing that did change was how loudly he yelled at me, because we also found out I had sensitive ears, so his yelling was literal torture for me, this doesn't mean he stopped yelling, just now, he wasn't putting his all into it.

But anyways, back to the whole threatening my life thing, you probably thought this happened after he spoke with the police, you probably thought that was just something he said in the heat of the moment. Nope.

My dad getting in trouble with the police happened when I was in 2nd grade, my dad threatening my life happened when I was in 9th or 10th grade, and I had never threatened to call police on him once, I never even once threatened to tell anyone how he treats me, he just decided it was a good time to remind me of how easily he could kill me, and he didn't play it for a joke, he played it straight.

My dad also try to weaponize my interests, anything I was enjoying, he would use it as a means to insult me or punish me, I once told him I felt this way, and he told me to my face that he is going to weaponize my interests.

Which surprise surprise, led me to being much more secretive about what I'm into, which led him to being upset that I started being so reclusive.

He also wanted me to feel bad for caring about my friends, during the pandemic, I spoke to people from my school online, and during a conversation with someone, they opened up to me about how they aren't doing well mentally and was thinking of killing himself.

I of course, was worried about him, but when my dad asked what I was doing, and I foolishly told my dad I was worried about my friend, he made fun of me and my suicidal friends.

This mockery of me caring for others even continued at dinner, when he thought it was hilarious I was worried someone wanted to end their own life.

I wish I didn't let that affect me getting friends once the pandemic ended, because now I have hardly anyone to turn to for help, which is why I had to turn here.

My dad has also refused to teach me how to do certain things, like laundry, one summer I asked him to please teach me, and he didn't.

He also would be too tired to cook dinner, buy take out, and then complain about how I always want to eat out and how it's costing him so much money.

There are plenty more times when my dad thought it was appropriate to lash out at me, but those are just the times I immediately thought of.

Now I'm in a position where I'm so scared to be thrown out of my house, because he'll be legally allowed to, and I'll have no where to go, I will starve.

My dad ever since I was little had always told me he spoils me, so I always have this thought, maybe he's right. I'm just overreacting, I know I told all these like I'm the victim, but maybe I'm just a brat.

My sad does plenty of nice things, he's given gifts to me, but I don't want him to buy whatever I want, I just want to be able to spend time with him and not have to worry about getting yelled at.

I love my dad, I want him to be proud of me, but I often feel like I'm not the kid he wants, he wants someone else, someone from his generation, he always complains about my generation.

I'm not the kid he wants, I just hope he loves me at least a little. "
"Argued with my mom over something so ultimately inconsequential. She didn’t even apologize after she realized her mistake. Ofc she didn’t cause she never fucking does. I said she doesn’t even care and that’s the worse part. She said “of course I care”. I said no she didn’t because if she did, she would’ve gotten an abortion knowing she wouldn’t be able to care for 3 teens and a set of twins.

I couldn’t stop crying in the shower. When I came back to the room I had to ask her why she couldn’t have just stopped at 3 kids. WHY. WHY. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BRING ME TO THIS FUCKING EARTH. WHY MOM. WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME. "
"So this going to be long, i'll try to summerize as much as possible. SO!
While growing up i was 3rd child, and usually i've played alone cz everyone was busy. As i was growing more, my parents expected me to have all perfect grades since ,,i dont do nothing trough the house"" mind you i was a damn kid, and the only time they ,teach me' is trough yelling. 
By the time i tried to uphold perfect grades i've been bullied (like actually) ngl it would be rarepy physical but i was humiliated so much trough life i feel numb at this point.

I never opened up to them, bcz we barely spend time together, and whenever i had different opinion i'd be laughed, mocked upon. So i didnt bother anymore. I was scared to tell them about bullying cz they yelled and always minimize my feelings. 
I never gotten outside - YES - to hang out properly, i never asked for something big, or money, or anything really.....and i was called spoiled. 

So at high-school after so many ongoing belitlment  to the point i've received comemnts like ,,you'll be no one and nothing, i regret giving bearth to you..."" one they it clicked and i started standing up for myself. 

And ever since then it gotten worse.....
At first i was being respectful and then turned onto me cussing specially at dad. He is very manipulative, twists narrative and everyone follows him despite not liking his attitude cz he is a ,provider' of family. 
The only time in my life, he was to ridicule. 

Anyways, is started as emotional thing trough physical abuse. Desk on the floor, throwing things, punching me and kicking, holding my neck - and telling me how i should be grateful for not being killed just bcz he can..... 
It gotten to point where i ran away multiple tomes, got 2 of phone broken cz i wanted to call the police and had evidance. 

What hurts me tho, my mom who was also abused by him in the past, he was sticking by his side and pointing fingers at me that i was the one peovoking him so i deserve it. 

Never once ever anyone tough of maaaybe calling the police?? 

Im now 23 and deeply regret listening to my teacher who told me i quote ,,he does that bcz he loves you"". I've been gaslight by peiple so much and all i have is resentment and hatred towards him. 

We are now in more advanced country, and i've tried being extra responsible ,,cz i was not before"" and guys.......

After all cooking something special (so they have breakfast, dinner AND take it at work - take time to make stuff like this), cleaning, picking up my little sister from school walking cz we cant afford car, sacrifise my free time, space to make new friends, i have bo friends except online, no money, no real life support. All cz i was honest, standing up for my rights and im just sad and miserable. 


I do have confidence but it hurts that i'll the only time i'll be acknowledged is when i get successful on my own. And guess what i live in such culture that HE will take all the credit for it. Im sick of this!

There so many things that has happened but this is the fastest i can tell. 
Thanks for everyone that read my desperate venting but yes im devistated that i look like i have a family but i really do not.....


P. S.S.
- Extra points = My family told me to keep quiet about this while dad has been telling everyone that i was being rebellious and was provoking him (which makes it even harder to my my part of story beliable since the evidances are gone) .....all i wanted is an apology, and him stop blaming other for his mistakes

So pleaseee! If ANYONE starts to think ,,He/she said/will change"" i'm here tot ell you they will NEVER! 
Unfortunately YES your family indeed can be selfish. 

Do not let your understanding become enabling. Peace."
"I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My mother is a malignant narcissist and I finally cut them all off DEC2023. My husband and his family was the only thing good that happened to me. I tried and fought hard to protect it, I didnt want my Mom to ruin this for me too. But she did! It seems like she already manipulated my MIL and now she's become a flying monkey. Im devastated cause I can never go back from this! I feel betrayed. "
"I’ve never really been able to find the right  words to say to you . After  abusing me and my siblings for our entire lives you turn around and turn ur back on us with our own children. You got a tattoo done and told me at 14 you wouldn’t tattoo my name because you were afraid of me growing up leaving you. Your a liar. When I was 8 You pulled me off the bunk bed by my hair and gave me pumpnots. You beat me and put bruises on my thighs when I was 9 because I stole marshmallow fluff. Even Devin remembers it because the bruises were so bad I couldn’t wear shorts and it was middle of summer. You never came to school for me I would always for you in the crowds of parents and you were never there. You shoved lasagna down my throat and while doing so you stabbed my throat with your long nails. You hit me and my sister with a belt In front of other children and adults at a daycare. My memory of that is very vague but I remember it happening because I wondered why the teacher would laugh instead of stopping you. You used to take us to the police station when we started fighting against the abuse, you pointed out to the police the cuts on my 12 year old legs. I cut myself because you made me hate myself. You sent us to high school with the same panties and outfit on everyday. No new shoes no new backpacks we got bullied almost every day. When you found out I had sex for the first time you punched me in the face and arms and pulled my hair. You took my McDonald’s paycheck from me to bail your husband out of jail and never paid me back you knew I was trying to save up to take my dog to the vet. I have cptsd because of your abuse so I can’t remember everything but I’m reminding you of this so you remember you are a child abuser you just didn’t get caught . I’m not much of a Christian but I know god will make you pay the consequences of how you’ve treated me and my siblings.


I was trying to get out of a abusive relationship I posted about in other subs so you’ll see it there. I texted my mom who isn’t biological but she had me my whole life. I have a newborn and a toddler and after crying and begging her to let my kids stay there away from him so we have somewhere to go she ignored me. I know she didn’t love me ever so I don’t know I expected her to care about my kids. But I’m really glad I texted her this because she likes to lie and act like she forgot about the things she put us through. (And for context on the part about the tattoo she did have her other kids names done so it was name tattoos she was doing) I hate this woman. I have one biological sister my other two baby siblings are adopted she took in 4 kids she didn’t like or love just to abuse them. A lot of my biological family told me she used us for money and government assistance I believe them but I don’t care for them because they don’t help me and wasn’t there for me either "
I am 17 I will be 18 in a month and I won’t be able to afford to move out. My mom has always taken her anger out on me. After my dad left I became the person she cusses out and screams to. When I was 14 she was mad at me for not having a job and she would neglect me which kind let me get into a relationship that was really abusive for a while. Anyway fast forward 3 years she hit with this guy and made me and her move and buy a house and have him live with us. I don’t think life is going as good as she planned I tried to warn her but she took it as me trying to ruin her only chance of happiness. I work at a chain store kinda like Walmart basically and I’ve worked there since I was 15 I had to transfer and now I don’t get many hours and it pisses my mom off but she won’t let me quit and she won’t let me get a second job. The other day she saw my car was a little dirty and she cussed me out and told me the if she was her dad she would of taken her belt and wiped me til I bleed she’s done this to me before where she threatens to beat me since I was a kid just wondering is it normal for this to be the case I’m 17 so I can’t get a full time job and my mom hates her new job and  takes all her anger out on me.
"About 3 years ago my seperated mom and dad got into a huge fight over a ridiculous thing. This whole thing resulted in her calling the CPS, lying and exaggerating about my dad and his mom neglecting my little brother that is 10 years younger than me. Her lies started an investigation by the CPS that lasted a couple of months but resulted in nothing. Due to this and a lot of different factors but the final straw being a two page A4 message about how shitty of a son and brother i was to my younger brother, after I the day before told her ""maybe"" when she asked if she could eventually borrow one of my monitors in the future, I went no contact with her and has been in no contact ever since. She also went on about how she regrets every good thing she ever did for me and bla bla bla. The fucking entitlement, holy shit! A couple of months before this she also committed a fake suicide after I and my dad distanced ourselves from her. She swallowed some ibuprofen (not nearly enough to kill) and called the ambulance. She later admitted that it was a “call for help” and that it was not a real suicide attempt.

Even before the first call to the CPS my mother once told me how my brother once told her that he wanted to live at her house (which is a totally normal thing for a 8 year old to do. Especially when you straight up ask him if he would want to live at your house and of course  it doesn’t actually mean that he wants to move there full time). Fast forward to late 2023, the CPS got anonymous complaints which resulted in an investigation once again. But this time they actually had a reason to be worried since my brother's mother, who he stayed at every other week was not doing well physically which resulted in my brother staying home from school a lot due to depression brought on by the worry about his mothers health. After a couple of months of investigating they decided to transfer my brother to my mother. And i dont for the life of me understand why the CPS didn't just give my dad full custody over my brother since 99% of their worries were about my brother's mom. They have yet to give him a logical reason for their decision, which probably means that my mom has been talking shit about him to the CPS.

 During the my mother decided to help dad and my brother's mom in the case. She was playing extremely helpful the whole time, her goal of course being to take full custody over my brother the whole time, which even looked like the best option in the end since the alternative would have been a whole different family. So my only alternative right now if I want to retain my relationship with my little brother at the same level is to resume contact with my plotting, manipulative, probably psychopath mother. She won. My dad and my brother´s mom doesn't seem to understand that they were being played and manipulated from the beginning and I don't know if i should tell them or not and a part of me want to believe that he just happened to be placed there by chance and that she wasn't plotting at all to begin with. What would you do in this situation?

for me its something bigger and much more complicated than that lol
"I need to get out. I'm scared and desperate for any help any donation will help me escape this hellhole and move in with my grandparents across country. Any support gets me away from her social services refuse to help me, Please if you can donate please do i’m begging, I can’t go to bed comfortably because i’m scared she may beat me while i sleep again."

more ragdolls to beat?
"And she immediately gave me that angry, hateful, ugly look that makes me see red every time. 

My brother and I basically had zero friends growing up due to severely stunted social skills thanks to mother. I love her; I really do and I had good memories with her, but... Where are the memories with friends and classmates? There are none because she was a HUGE CONTROL FREAK. She was always paranoid that the worst would happen to us, so she didn't let us go anywhere to even make friends. We only played with the super sweet Filipino boy neighbors because... They were neighbors! Whenever my brother and I would mess up in the slightest or if it wasn't our fault, she would hit us and say ""you can't do ANYTHING RIGHT"". Being isolated from mostly anyone else that wasn't family made us internalize all the ways she was being toxic to us. She doesn't wanna admit it, but I just KNOW the angry outbursts against us was her frustration from working two jobs to support us because she was too stupid to find a man that wasn't an alcoholic deadbeat fuck face. 

OOOOH then she started going to church and reading the Bible so she can feel like she became a better person, but she's still stuck in her own ways. I'm transgender, and the only people who didn't accept me were her and her lapdog ( my stepdad). Of course, she used religion as an excuse for her toxic ass ways. I still don't think she fully accepts me to this day. 

Now to the actual topic of the title: my brother moved many states away to be with his lover and is happy there. Of course my mother being the control freak felt like she was entitled to a text every day. It's not unreasonable, but the way she is when my brother takes days or weeks to respond is unreasonable. She would get on my case to text him to call her, but of course I barely took her seriously. Today, she told me that he still hasn't called. She pitifully whined ""I just don't get why he doesn't want to""

I wanted to say ""because you kept him from having a real life"" 

But it came out ""you weren't always the best mother""

And then came that piece of shit ugly ass spiteful face. I immediately barked ""don't give me that look, I'm done taking that from you!"" And immediately went to denial. I just left because she clearly can't handle the truth: that my brother and I went through so much bullying and so much loneliness because her control mattered more than to actually see us grow as individuals. It just makes me sad thinking she won't ever change her ways and that my world will get even smaller. Besides my BFF roommate, I have no friends and maybe losing my mother due to her stubbornness will leave me with practically no one in my world. "
"I am 19F and living in a religious household where my parents are stealing my money and human rights. I have a job which barely covers my bills, and i live in a small town where there aren’t many available jobs. My parents, rightfully, make me pay rent which i believe is too high. They yell at me to make money because im broke, but they take all the money i have left after i pay my bills. They still have control over my bank account. They have taken my passport which i was going to use to visit my long distance boyfriend. They don’t like the fact that i have a boyfriend who isn’t religious, and they believe he is only out to get me because him and i met online. For context, i have done a lot of checking and i know he is not some trafficker out to get me, and he is the best boyfriend ive had. They have stolen my passport, they steal all my money, they yell at me because im not religious, and they do nothing but berate me and tell me how i am a failure. They try to force their religion on me, which is illegal in my country. Stealing a passport is illegal. Taking my money for rent, without a legal rental agreement, is illegal. I want nothing but to escape but I can’t. I have no money, no passport, no support, no backup, nothing. They also have taken away my wifi, which i help them pay for. I don’t eat a lot because i don’t feel like being charged extra to survive. I barely have enough money to buy my own fucking shampoo and body wash. I struggle with multiple mental illnesses and can’t afford medication or therapy or any help and its only adding on to my helplessness. I have asked for a raise at work, for more shifts, tried looking for a second job or anything to make money. I am stuck in my room. I have a dog which they got me years ago who i can barely afford to feed, and they do nothing but yell at him when he gets excited. They told me they will not help me pay for his food. Ive chosen feeding him over myself sometimes, his food is expensive, as id anything in Canada. The only support i have is from my American boyfriend who lives hours away who I can’t even see because they’ve taken my passport. I don’t know what to do. I need advice. "
"His parents keep all his money, he has no other place to stay, and he cant get medication without them"
"My parents where super neglecfull in my life. They gave two shits about rasing us and I was stuck rasing all my siblings. They drank and never protected us when we needed is and always blames us for everything. Even when I got SS'd it was my own fault even though I was 10. However all of that changed when my brother was born. 


He was automatically the gem of the family. Suddenly he was the golden child and they had to protect him from all harm. They treated him like he was physically incapable of wrong and that he was the second coming of Jesus Christ in the sense. And boy did he abuse that. 

He has NEVER gotten in trouble for anything. He has killed multiple pets of mine and laughed about it, but they tell me he's younger so I shouldn't judge him too harshly. He's tried to stab me in my sleep before and has pulled a knife on me multiple times, and they just say I'm being overdramatic. Ive seen him grab my other siblings and beat the shit out of them for no reason and purposely walk up and punch them square in the face for no reason and laugh as they're crying. 

Its gotten to the point my mother has had to lock her room with deabolt in fear that he may try and get into the gun safe and hurt us or others. He knows he can get away with anything so he's constantly having ""adult interaction"" way before he's 18. He also has stolen, money, hygiene products, and a pearl necklace given to me by my grandmother to sell off. 

I'm afraid he's going to end up on the news one day for the worst reason possible. I know he's going to commit a crime so grauome and heartless that he'll get a movie made about him. 

My parents failed at raising us, but they created something even worse. They created an actual monster. Every time I look in his eyes they are black like death and look like every crazed persons eyes. I wished he had to struggle like we did, because maybe there would of been a chance of him being normal. I think it's to late for him now, and I don't think anyone can fix him. They just keep making excuses for the behavior and they keep giving him free passes out of life. He went to a therapist once, but he doesn't supposidly actually talk during those sessions.

I hate my parents. That may be harsh but I do. They created a truly awful being that will hurt some poor family some day and they'll still be on his side. I just wish that I could rip the DNA I shared with my brother and parents, off of me and throw it into a bin and walk away. "
"I'm having an awful Mental Health flare up, currently barricaded in ""my room"" that has A LOT of trauma associated with it. I can't sleep.

There's a park nearby and I'm really thinking about laying on the bench tonight.

My parents also like to burst into my room without my permission so I have something barricading it at the moment so they can't walk in while I'm asleep. Technically I need to move/I'm homeless. They lured me back in after a bad medical crisis left me unable to work. I think I need to find a shelter for DV victims. This isn't okay. I feel so crazy :(

"how does one live long enough to finally escape their abusive parent? 

my father is overbearing and extremely abusive towards his children and the women with whom he has had children with. i have been telling myself i only have about a year or 2 left w him (depending on how my college admissions go).

i'm 17f btw and idk if i can do this w him much longer. i also have little siblings who have way more time left w him and idk how i'd feel if i kms and left them behind or if i went off to college and left them behind to suffer at the hands of him.

there's not much i can do rn bc he doesnt let us leave the house or go outside, so i can't get a job or anything and he won't take me to get some documents i need for college and some other stuff. 

idk what to do and i just feel so numb and lost.

any advice helps, sorry if this is kind of all over the place i'm kinda just ranting/word vomitting rn. "
"I (21F) decided to runaway today. I don’t know if it’s even considered that but I was badly beaten up by my mom today when I told her I wanted to move out and wanted to start my life after doing so she came to my room and begged me to stay and asked for my forgiveness but at that point I was so done. So I decided to just pack my things and quietly left. I’ve been her slave ever since I was a kid. I was physically and emotionally abused by her. 
I blindly stayed for years even after enduring so much pain because I felt bad for her for being a single mother. I have 5 others siblings; 2 in the Philippines ( 14yrs old and 6 yrs old ) and 3  ( 1 yrs old , 3 yrs old. And 5 yrs old ) here in Japan. We all have different fathers. And they all left I was left with the responsibility of feeding them and raising them. 
I feel so guilty for leaving them behind. But they’re too young to come with me. Especially my little sister who had always cried for me when I was being abused. 
Idk why I’m feeling so guilty for my abuser as well for leaving her to raise 5 kids. 

"
"Extremely neglectful to them mostly. But she also actively encourages her other older children to commit credit card fraud. She was recently arrested and the last thing she said to her 14-year-old son was, “looks like you’re going to have to take up the family business”. (That’s what she calls her fraud scheme.)

Now her 21-year-old daughter, who came all the way from Florida to attempt to kidnap my older brother’s children, wants to talk about how she’s not dumb because she’s the one “making money without even having to step a foot outside”. This is after her mom apparently didn’t even have any contact with her for YEARS. I’m thinking this whole entire family is fucked??

Their mom would also just straight up buy weed for her son and her other, younger daughter (12). She herself is a coke addict and would constantly bring strange people into her home where she had TWO INFANTS. They didn’t even have their own bedroom, she’d given their bedroom to their older brother and they just slept in the living room on a mattress.

Since my brother has finally realized she’s a crazy bitch who never wanted to be a hApPy FaMiLy with him, he’s been learning how to be an actual father. My mom is actually able to visit them now that she doesn’t have to deal with that wench either, and they’re literally different children. It just disgusts me that every time my mom reported her to CPS they did fuckall. Not even when she reported that they were found with really weirdly specific wounds 
😭😭 They just knocked on her door and shrugged when she didn’t open the door ig!!"
"I'm not totally sure if my parents are abusive or not, so I wanna see other peoples opinions



So my dad cheated on my mom when I was about 3-4 and he moved out shortly after. Before then, both my parents were absent in my life. Because my dad worked during the day, the only times I would see him would be early in the morning or late at night, and my mom worked night-shift so she would often sleep during the day. I wasn't mistreated, I got fed and watered, but I feel like I never had much interaction with them. 

After my dad moved out, me and mom left left to live with another man she found. He was an amazing guy until he began using drugs and asulted my mom one night. I did not witness it but I remember the day it happened. A little after that my dad met my stepmom. They started dating and she would often say things like ""I don't want a kid"" or ""I don't like kids"" in front of 5 year old me. Eventually she stopped after my mom confronted her about it, but the fact she even said anything like that really bothers me. 

I started public school for the first time right after my 6th birthday since I used to be homeschooled, I loved school and it was like a place for me to actually have fun. In second grade my best friend and her mom and sister moved in with me and my mom. I was so excited but me and my friend hated each other for the next two years. Her mom would always treat us unfairly, babying my friend and yelling at me. I understand I wasn't her child but still. My mom would often take me and my friend to the store or her work to avoid my friends mom, and I am pretty sure she played a major role in me being suicidal in 3rd grade (don't worry I got better)

Now, at my mom's house, several years later, there is stuff everywhere, the house is a huge fire hazard. It isn't as bad as those houses on that horders show though. And I think the place just stresses me out so much that I don't want to help clean up, instead I do things to keep my mind off of everything. My mom also talks about her problems with me, even after she has said it is a form of abuse. 

My dad isn't a big issue, but he is a very passive parent. He doesn't take me to doctors appointments or make sure I'm not getting into trouble. 

But I think my stepmom is the worst. Probably the best way to describe her is that it's like I'm walking of glass around her, one wrong move and it breaks. And lieing to her is like there is a crack in the glass and I try taping it, sometimes it still breaks and sometimes it doesn't. I don't get yelled at or hit, but I can't do anything I really enjoy without getting either scolded or in trouble. I am a therian and I do a sport called quadrobics which is where one runs and jumps on all fours. When I do quadrobics, my stepmom would say something like ""If you act like and animal we will treat you like and animal."" Even though I am just being myself. She is over-protective as well, I can't climb trees or talk to strangers online whatsoever. She has rules for me that she doesn't follow herself like how I am not allowed to interrupt people because it's rude though for some reason she is allowed to interrupt me. 

  
Anyway I could keep going and going about these people but I'm not going to. I don't want to write a whole novel lol. If anyone knows if this is abuse or not and if anyone has any ideas on how to cope with it I am all ears. I have tried therapy and journaling but neither are for me. Thanks!"
"Hi, I live in the UK, 22F, and I really want this story to be known. This is going to be long, because this is a decade worth of information, and I have issues with remembering times and orders of things, so it might get messy. This is also very unbelievable, but I assure you, I can prove this is all true.

My mom and my dad split up when I was a child, maybe 10ish. My mom stole money from my dad who worked hard to support us. While he was at work, a guy would come knock on our door which I'd sometimes answer. Big biker dude, he'd ask for my mom if I answered and it turns out he was selling her ketamine. I was just answering the door to her ket dealer as a literal child.

My dad kept ferrets and lurchers and my mom had a Chihuahua. When they split, she kicked him out and proceeded to starve his animals. The ferrets all starved to death. The lurches, mother and adult pup, were starved too. When RSPCA found them, the pup had only survived by eating the carcass of the mother. I think my mom hid them in a black bag. Her dog, the Chihuahua, was fine though. She lied about trying to commit suicide when confronted. I saw it all, and still have nightmares about that night.

She stopped me seeing my dad but my dad fought hard to try and see me. I can't remember much of this time, but she managed to get away with separating us. Guess the court just fucked up. She made me go by my nan's last name so I couldn't be found. My dad would never stop looking for me, nor his side of the family, but they had no idea she'd made me go by another last name.

She started going out with lots of different men at the same time. I remember seeing a new guy in the house each day. I remember asking why so many people were coming over while a guy was there once, and I got told off afterwards. 

This part gets especially messy. She meets a guy who sticks around. Big Irish guy, has a daughter. We end up living in a place with them. She leaves all our belongings in the house I grew up in. Didn't take my baby photos, clothes, anything of mine. Took her own stuff, though, and I think it all gets chucked in a skip when the house goes up for sale. Fresh start with the new guy I guess.
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, she started showing me pictures of intimate parts of the body. I was still a child, I couldn't have been older than 12. She gave me 'massages' and made me give her some. We were made to bath together and share a bed. Single bed, originally. I was molested. So fucking much. I didn't even know it was wrong or abnormal so I never said anything, I just carried on with things. There are lots of things from this time.

Started going to school. Secondary school, which was hard because when we went to live with the Irish guy she just took me after school one day and we never went back. Didn't do my GCSE's, so every school I went to treated me like I was stupid. Her and the Irish guy break up. Messy I think, got physical. She dumped me at the house of the friend I made for months. I didn't see her for months. Didn't hear from her. My friend got abusive, would beat me up when I went to eat food. I'd lock myself in the bathroom so she couldn't hurt me, she'd give me a plate of food to apologize. It would repeat. 

She came back, we moved into a place. Just us. She met a guy, he started grooming me. Somewhere before this we were in a hostel. I only found out recently when I was told, but it came back. I have memories that lead me to believe I was r*ped. 

This is already a long post, but I'm not even halfway through my story. I guess I'll carry it on another time. If you read this far, thank you. I've been so desperate for someone else to know what has happened. Someone outside of the few friends I have in my life right now.

Sorry if any of this doesn't make sense or such, I'm just typing it out the way it comes out of my brain. Rambling and stuff, at 12:22 at night.

"my mom emotionally abused me badly but my dad never found out bc he traveled for work a lot. he thinks I’m distant and unable to talk abt my emotions bc of him and thinks it’s bc of something he did. i can’t tell him abt my mom bc it could hurt their relationship and they love each other and i don’t want to taint my dads image of her. but i have no one to talk to and my dad is probably the only one who would understand bc he was abused when he was a kid. its just not fair that i had to go through all that just for my mom to act all nice about me now that I’ve moved out and talk about how such a great person I turned out to be and to act like she always loved me in front of my dad and on social media, and i have to live w it alone. it’s not fair that I had to go through that and now i can’t even talk to my dad or talk to him without crying anymore and what she did is hurting my relationship w my dad. in addition even if I told my dad he might not believe me bc emotional abuse is seen as less severe than physical and there’s no proof of it"
"Hello, I made a post in AskUK 3or so months ago about my mother's emotional abuse of my sister; [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1aw8lq3/should\_i\_report\_my\_mother\_for\_child\_neglect/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1aw8lq3/should_i_report_my_mother_for_child_neglect/)

They wouldn't let me post the update so I've resorted to trawling reddit for other places to seek advice so sorry if this is wrong too.   
  
On the back of that post I reached out to the NSPCC (UK Child Neglect / Abuse Charity) for support, they then reached out to my local social services on the back of this who then went to see and speak to my mother - they raised the concerns with her and had a little look around the house and that was it.

They didn't make any attempts to speak w/ my sister, with her mother telling her the social was happy and the case was being closed. I then reached out to the social myself, letting them know it was me and that I was concerned no-one has spoken to my sister.

They then set up her head of year at school to have a chat w/ her - with him reporting back to the social what she'd said. According to my sister he reassured her what was happening wasn't okay and he understood her feelings being in this position.

The social did nothing.

I kept the social up to date w/ any new developments from the home. Further instances of how my sister was spoken to, how this impacted her emotional and mental wellbeing and a recent incident where she had agonizing tonsilitis but her mother refused to acknowledge it or that she needed to go to a doctors - that is, until I told my sister I'd take her first thing. Only then did she agree something was wrong.

Following my last two further reports to the social, I haven't had any responses. I've noted they're welcome to get in touch and if what I was doing wasn't appropriate to please let me know, I'd be happy to leave them to their investigations I just wanted to offer more context of what was going on in the home.

Well today my sister has told me that her mother has let her know the case has been closed permanently. They aren't taking any more action. They've decided that I'm effectively being vindictive and trying to get my mother 'in trouble'. This info is coming from the mouth of my mother so I'm taking it with a pinch of salt as I know she'll be taking the closure as an absolute win and confirmation she isn't doing anything wrong. 

Further to this, they also told my mother everything my sister had said in that meeting w/ her year head.

All of this while knowing they didn't even speak directly to my sister once.

I'm at my wits end. Nothing has changed. My mother is an emotionally abusive and incredibly selfish person. I'm really concerned for my sister as she's about to go on to college and I don't want her mental struggles preventing her from going where she wants and getting to Uni. She's struggling enough as it is with her GCSEs  and has self harmed in the past. 

The house is covered in mould, years worth - my mother says this is all the fault of my sister - she's 16. It's not up to her to bleach a whole house. I still have to buy my sister food sometimes. I took her prom dress shopping, her t-shirt stank and had stains of mould on it. She starts conversations on topics she's passionate about with 'I know you won't care but..'

It breaks my heart and I don't know what to do - I don't have the space or money to house her until she's able to run off for Uni. We're looking at her moving in with her Grandmother for College but it's up in the air. Everyone seems to agree she's in the wrong but the official channels who are supposed to help can't be arsed to do anything, or even tell her mother that their relationship isn't healthy, whether they think it needs their intervention or not. 

I've had issues with my mother myself over the years (exploiting me for lifts, housework, money, being downright horrible when I moved out with my fiance, being absent during the planning and my actual wedding day) - I did want to talk these things through but she'd bail on any plans and at this point I've written it all off in place of just making sure my sister can be safe as she still lives with her. 

I'm sorry for the long post, I'm just kinda lost and my sister being subject to two more years of this shit is awful. "
"I'm posting this in a few places but I need advice, I want to move out of my dad's house, badly, and I want to take all of my stuff with me because I've lost all my belongings before. However, my dad will very much call the police and tell them I stole things when I did not, and I don't want to get in trouble for this as our local law enforcement seems to believe everything that comes out of his mouth despite the fact they've been over here every other week almost for domestic disputes with his girlfriend and he has given them no reason to believe him. We have a landlord who is a relative and my mom wants to have her there so she can watch the process and ensure I didn't steal anything but I worry that won't be enough. Any advice is insanely appreciated."
"I'll go first. My(24m) father often tells me that he'd never see my face of he had another son.
Today also he said the same thing and I feel awful."
"I'm 18 and I want to estrange, but my parents have done nothing but help me. My therapists see why I would want to leave, but everyone keeps telling me about how hard it's going to be, and tell me that they would be a fool to tell me not to stay, some even asking me over and over to stay in contact with them, at least through college so that they can help me pay.

My parents have always paid for everything for me, they've paid for my fancy private school, and they've paid for my wardrobe, which is way too large, and they've paid for all of my depression medication and hospital stays.

I, on the other hand, have never really tried to make our relationship better. I've wanted to estrange from them since I was 9, following a strenuous court case, my father driving across the country and attempting to take me away from my mother by force, him calling my mother horrible names and forcing me to agree, and my mother egging on my eating disorder, that started around 7-8, by telling me that I ate too much (despite being underweight), and that she didn't care if I starved myself as long as I didn't cry to her about it and bother her.

  
Throughout my childhood, my father has always been pretty angry, yelling at me, knocking the wind out of my by hitting me very hard in the stomach, and throwing stuff around my room, making me clean it again, when I didn't do it well enough the first time. He also fueled my eating disorder by telling me that I was too chubby (I wasn't, I just wasn't underweight for the first time in my life), and locking all the doors and windows in the house and screaming at me to run, while laughing at me. By this time though, I was already pretty distant towards him, and had been since I was around 6 years old. I'm not sure why I've been so resentful towards him my whole life, but I remember crying at most of his ""jokes"" towards/about me, and wishing on my 6th birthday that I could parent him and my mother to teach them how to act like adults (I really don't know what sparked this). 

  
In recent years, I fear that I have in some ways, stagnated in my mental growth. There have been many situations since I was young, and up until last year where I yell and scream at them and cry. During a wellness check last year, some police listened to me telling them that I felt my mother was emotionally abusive and gaslighting me, following her telling me that I could never mature as a person, and become fully healed like she is, and that it was crazy that I needed to heal anyways because I had never been through anything bad in life. She then proceeded to tell me to tell her all of my issues with her so that she could write them down, and present them to my therapist as reasons that I was ""f'ed in the head"".

  
My father also has a habit of saying very wild things when he's mad. Almost a year ago now, I told him that I didn't enjoy him and his mother calling me bad names, accusing me of doing things I would never even think of doing, and calling me and my hair ugly, especially when I'll get plenty of compliments on that style. I then told him that even if I looked horrible, and wouldn't get a job because of it, that I'd rather learn the hard way, that just take people's word on everything, because then I'd actually learn, and be able to apply those lessons elsewhere in my life. He responded with telling me that I'd end up on drugs, homeless, and with a gun shoved down my throat, and he said that he hopes before I get shot in the head, he hopes I remember him, and how if I had listened I wouldn't be about to die.

  
That being said, I also did something horrible, and sent him an email containing all of the things I've ever written about him, from English assignments, to text messages, to share with him all that I feel he's done wrong, and how much I disliked him, and the fact that it wasn't me blowing something that had happened recently out of proportion, but was in-fact something I had felt for years.

  
He still calls me though, and tells me he loves me, and to call more. Sometimes it is me who starts being rude first, I always give him one word answers, and have since middle school.

  
My mother helps out to. She buys me plane tickets to go see her, and sends me money periodically.  
It feels like as a kid I was hurt, but now I'm just the worst person alive, even if they have done horrible things recently. I mean even if they have been horrible, I've been closed off since I was a kid. I even had one therapist tell me that it felt like they were trying and I wasn't (this comment was made after weeks of family therapy, though neither of us mentioned his comment on me being a homeless drug addict in any future where I don't follow his every word).

  
I don't know. I feel like I'm going insane trying to figure out if it is me that ruined this, that drove them to be worse to me over the past few years. Though I've wanted to estrange for half my life now, I don't know whether they've been abusive, or if I've been sowing problems, and am now punishing them by trying to get away."
"
My parents are going through an awful divorce. My mom has dealt with a love of verbal and some physical abuse over the years from my dad who has a lot of mental health issues and really bad anger issues. He thinks she’s the devil basically and is constantly cursing at her and being terrible to her and about her to me and in front of my younger siblings. I’m doing my best to make it better for my siblings and I’m stuck in the middle between my parents so much and it’s so awful. My dad uses me to regulate his emotions and guilts me into feeling bad for him and I tell him what he’s doing is wrong all of the time and I defend my mom all of the time but I also feel guilty and I know he’s in a lot of pain. I’m too empathetic. But he thinks I’m terrible and on my mom’s side and she’s lying to people about him and ruining his life. My mom thinks I deny the abuse and collude with him and support him. I hate myself, I can feel the anger and the hatred from them and I’m disgusted with myself. I feel like such a bad person all of the time. I don’t deserve to feel good, I don’t deserve to eat, I don’t deserve comfort but I want it so badly. I’m 23 and I just want someone to hug me and call my baby and sweetheart and tell me I’m doing good and they will fix this for me. I’ve tried so hard to take care of everyone and protect my siblings and I love people so much and I feel other peoples emotions so much and I’m failing at everything."

"# This is NOT an OFFICAL cry for help. Let me describe the situation.

It's a normal Friday afternoon until my mom goes to my dad’s room and starts yelling at him. I try to stop my mom, but it doesn't work. 

I say everything I can. I try to get my mom to calm down, but once she starts, there's no convincing her. Whenever my dad and I try to talk to her logically, she rambles about being perfect and how she can’t. She doesn't show love, refuses to take me to schools I got admitted into because of my “lack of academic eagerness and achievement” and doesn't know how to encourage me. All my mother can do is insult me, and try to toy with my emotions negatively. I have let it happen for way too long. Every week, she taunts me at least once. It usually occurs when we're in an Argument and I try to fight back. “Here's my phone, go call 911 if you want,” she says to me, knowing that as a kid, I don't have the guts to do it.

Every day my mom makes my and my dad’s life a living hell. My dad does so much for her but she doesn't even acknowledge it. Now I've reached a point. I can’t hold it in for much longer, but I don't want to do anything rash. My questions are: What can I do to prevent abuse? Is divorce a rational option? Can I report my mother for domestic abuse and if yes, what type of evidence do I need?"

"So long story short, my dad has high blood pressure issues and my sister has severe depression. Pretty sure these manifested from events in the house. My mother has always been really abusive, growing up it was to my dad and even now to the point his blood pressure is very high and she berates him. She states she does nothing wrong and he says he tries to avoid her. She has these bouts of screaming and shouting over small things like someone moving her cooking spoon from its place for example and and my sister has panic attacks and she carries on screaming while my sister states she is struggling to breathe. I’m worried this will push my sister to the edge. Growing up I was called ridiculous things and even told to die at one point. I started self harming and now I’m married with a good man and I stopped the self harming.  I have always been berated by her however I don’t like the effect it’s having on my family. I’m at a loss of what to do. In front of everyone else she looks like she can’t hurt a fly. I thought I was being weak until my husband joined the family and he was shocked at what he saw. He’s uncomfortable and can’t stay in my parents house long. She doesn’t have any mental health illnesses as far as I’m aware. I don’t know how to cope or get help. If I take any action against her she blames my father. I have never seen someone with as many narcissistic qualities as well. Oh and she also turned her own brothers and sisters against each other by talking about them all behind their back. Writing this all down makes me realise how crazy it sounds. 
"
"My alcoholic hateful dad had been insulting me, belittling me and as a result I ended up suicidal, with severe mental illnesses, negative self talk, core beliefs (I'm a failure, valueless, unlovable, broken (as in a machine), and I'm someone who shouldn't have ever been born).

But whom I hold accountable the most is my mother. She has been complicit, scaring me into staying silent about the abuse I endured. I'm having recurring daily nightmares about her.

A few days back I got an idea. Let's open up with my story and share it with... her work colleagues. Let's send an e-mail to every hospital personal where she works describing in vivid details the abuse I had to endure. Let each person judge her for her actions. I've been told it's cruel and I wholeheartedly agree with this. I just can't stand her getting away with everything.

She doesn't have an intellectual capacity to come up with an answer more profound than a denial. Even if she manages to convince some of the staff that all I've written is nonsense, the family reputation will get tarnished forever. It's satisfying to imagine having my revenge after being told to stay quiet all of my life. To speak at last, speak so loud that everyone will hear and make their judgement. "

"in no particular order:

- took me aside in the pet store right before i was going to pick out a hamster i'd finally convinced my parents to get for me, and then pressured me on the spot to get a rat instead. i got the rat

- talked so much during family therapy that my therapist had to tell him to shut up

- when i asked him to drive me to the hospital because i was suicidal, he drove in circles in the parking lot until he'd successfully pressured me into letting him drive me home

- claimed he was tough on me because i was constantly failing (and i was), only to turn around and treat my high-achieving younger sister the exact same way when i moved out

- promised to stand up for me when i had an episode and got too overwhelmed to speak, then immediately pressured me to speak to the director of my school in a room with half my teachers in it before he'd take me home

- guilted me for not wanting to go on an international trip with my entire step-family during COVID lockdowns

- almost made a family friend homeless during winter by kicking her & her kid out of the garage he was forcing her to pay rent for.... because he wanted the space for his new jeep"
"My mum has been hitting me since I was 5 (I'm 15 now), to be more specific only when shes angry. I love my mum so much but when shes angry it's really bad, she screams, hits, and doesn't let me talk. I'm not allowed to explain my side of the story. My dad also just tells me to shut up and in my house my mum is always right. Even though my parents don't want me talking back or even explaining my side they always tell me that me expressing my feelings is an issue. I've had trouble expressing my feelings ever since my mum became abusive. For some reason I have always found it much more comfortable to sit by myself and cry.

People (my closest friends) have suggested that I tell somebody about this, but the problem is I don't want anything happening to my mum. Plus she would definitely be angry if I told anyone about this. So I'm very stuck on what to do."
"i, 16f (17 on the 29th) have been dealing with an alcoholic mother my entire life. my mom is 54 and a single mother, up until last year. in 2022 i forced myself into foster care because of her neglect and abuse onto me. 

i have 2 older sisters, J 28F and R 22F. J is disabled and has had multiple health issues since she was 14. R has mental issues (bipolar) and she currently has custody of me. J moved out 3 years ago and R moved out 2 years ago.

i’m currently the only child who lives with my mom, alongside her boyfriend who is disabled as well. i lived with R for nearly a year but she gave me back to mom because she couldn’t afford the items i needed. while i’ve been back with mom (moved in october 2023) she’s gotten drunk way over 30 times, with police being called 4 times.

my entire life i’ve dealt with my mom and her abusive antics, and my sisters never allowed me to get support since they were scared i would be lost in the foster care system, and get more trauma than i already had. cps was called constantly back then, and i always got yelled at by mom when she told me i had to clean the house up before cps arrived. 

i’ve recently been able to start driving on my own and getting my own job, and of course, she will come into my room at night and tell me to drive her down the street to the gas station. i tell her i legally can’t do that, since i don’t want to get pulled over and the police see a 16 year old driving her drunk 54 mother to get cigarettes.

tonight has been one of those awful nights of her drinking, and she straight up told me i just need to move out and leave since she “doesn’t need anybody anymore “. so i told her “alright, give me a date and i’ll get out.” then she immediately said i twisted her words up and i’m a selfish brat. 

my partner has a home i can go to while i wait to be 18 and officially leave home, R (who has legally custody of me) says i’m able to go there, since she feels bad she can’t take care of me and obviously my mom can’t either.

i went to the ER 2 nights ago (the er she…. works at too..) and they prescribed me medication for my illness. my mom came into my room yesterday morning and told me to not take any of the medications? she never gave me an explanation as to why.

i don’t know what to do anymore. i struggle with multiple mental issues as well, but my mom always says it’s my fault and i need to get help. yet… she doesn’t ALLOW me to go to appointments. she’s cancelled all of my appointments after i keep begging her , saying i need to go to the doctor, she always ignores me.

i need to get out before i go even more insane, i just don’t know the best way to get out though. my partner is allowing me to move in with them, but they are a far distance away. i just don’t know what to do anymore"

"My mother has always hated me and she doesnt bother hiding it anymore. On top of treating me like absolute rubbish, she blames me for the way SHE treats and talks to me! I’m beyond tired and drained from the toxic merry go round im trapped on. I wont go into all the ways she traumatized me as a child and displayed her hatred for me. My mothers never been on my side of any argument or fight, she sides with ANYONE else and makes me out to be the bad guy. She’s never once apologized to me for all the messed up things shes done and said to me. She’ll blame me for the way she physically and verbally attacks me and says things like “you depress me” and “its just because ___” as if those are excuses?? Recently ive been out of work for some time and shes been holding over my head the fact she allows me to live with her as if im just her friend. She chose to raise a child and somehow thinks providing a roof over my head is the ultimate sacrifice. Today we got into a heated argument because she’s a spaz and has been treating me like shit in front of people amd when i stick up for myself….im told im playing victim and im dramatic. Today my mother called me a loser, a bitch and a fatass bitch. Ive had body issues my entire life due to her and people in my family commenting on body all the time. So just crazy to hear my mother admit thats how she sees me. She woke me up saying “youre about to be homeless”. Heavily implying that she’ll kick me out so now im looking for a new place to live. Im just disappointed that shes so old and will never change. "

"My mom and dad physically abused me while I was a kid up until I was 18, I learned yesterday that they were in their late 40s and early 50s in this period. I was bewildered to find this out, since at that age I would just expect anyone to know better than to hurt a child. Anyway, this led me to reliving all the things that they did. In specific, there is one episode that I remember vividly - they took my glasses off so I couldn't see (and also because they would frequently break them in their beatings and didn't want to spend money to get them repaired) and then the two of them closed me in a room and then hit me. The next day, I chopped off my hair and called the police. The police didn't really do much, they asked me if I was getting good grades in school (I was). My mother was a lot more abusive than my father, who would apologize afterwards, but he was also emotionally abusive and controlling. They normalized all of this as being culturally acceptable.

Anyway, I've been away from home since I turned 18. I left the country to study outside of. In this period, contact with them was once a week and for 2-3 years I was not speaking to my mother at all. In this period, my father came and convinced me that she was sorry and she loves me and I began speaking to her again around COVID in 2021. Since then, I feel that I constantly lift myself up but I'm dragged down by interactions with her. She repeatedly treats me like a child and tries to take over my life when invited into my home (I live alone and separately). When I point something out, she yells and throws a fit like a child. One recently scarring moment was when she was driving me and my brother in a car and then we got into an argument and she tried to scare me by driving the car in a zig-zag and reckless manner, I hit my head onto the ceiling of the car and she said it would be better if we all just died, she would kill us all (me, my brother and her).

The thing is, I've decided I'm going to cut her off completely, but I still want to maintain a relationship with my father. I think I do like him. But it's very hard for me to move on from what happened. I am frequently triggered and reminded of the things he did - one of the big ones being forcing me into a career that I never wanted and making me give up opportunities that were truly exceptional (like a full ride to a PhD at an ivy league college pursuing my topic of interest). When I am reminded of his and their actions - for example while watching a movie or reading a post on Reddit or some other interaction, I admittedly call him and start yelling at him. I am only yelling and not hitting or anything, but it is abusive because abuse exists in the yelling. And it just brings me down for a couple of days. And then I spend time trying to make up. I don't know what to do. I don't think it's fair for me to ""forgive and forget"", because things have been repeated even recently. But I don't want to be so entirely loveless either. I don't know how to depart from this cycle. Please help me. "

"Hello,

My brother was a single parent until a couple of years ago and I have just found out that he is insulting his daughter. He has anger bouts any she is scared of him. She fawns in the hope that it’ll get better and she has asked me to keep silent about it because she is scared of repercussions.
It drives me mad and I am not sure what I can do besides listening and being there.
Would any of you have advice on the best way to react to this ?

Thanks

"This includes physical violence. Im crying right now as I'm writing this and I'll probably delete later, I need to get this off my chest. I'm a 17F, just finished my junior year of high-school. I grew up in an extremely toxic household but I didn't know it at the time, i thought getting regularly beat for something bad you did was normal. Whenever me or my other 3 sisters acted out of place, we would be beat and shoved into the closet or the bathtub and left for sometimes hours, if any of us left without him saying we could, well i think you could guess what happened. We would be thrown out of the house during winter with nothing but a t shirt and pants. I would be grounded for months for a stupid reason or he would break my electronics- my phone was shattered, as well as my school laptop. Currently I'm getting my car taken away forever because I said I didn't want to work at a job he wanted me to work at. I retaliated of course, and wouldn't give him the keys to my car. It escalated extremely quickly with him screaming at my face and he started throwing breaking things in my room. As soon as he threatened to hurt my animals I gave in and just gave him the keys. He hurts everyone and everything. When he eventually feels bad, he would buy us things or take us out somewhere, acting all nice as if he didn't just beat us. I feel like it's had my childhood ripped away from me, constantly feeling uncomfortable in my own home- now I'm an anxious person and it takes me so long to trust anyone. Wow that was a lot "

did anyone elso do this

Looking for some insight here. I grew up in an abusive/ highly religious family system…as a young child I was SA’d by my dad, and physically abused by both parents. Alcoholism, emotional abuse and and toxic religion were also a big part of my childhood. My mom and dad have swept things under the rug, downplayed a lot, and flat out denied or “ forgot” many things. They both responded with anger, and have tried to guilt and shame me for speaking the truth. 
In many ways my mom was a victim herself, but sadly throughout her life she was never able to see my dad and their marriage for what they were. She denies that any abuse took place and is protecting my dad. 
I haven’t had any sort of relationship with them for the last couple of years, and have pretty much reconciled myself to the fact that I need to keep it that way. Recently though, I’ve been struggling more with my sisters who still have ongoing interactions/connections with them. They didn’t experience everything that I did, but there was still a lot. And although they believe me that I was SA’d, they are not convinced that it was our dad, and none of them have confronted my parents about how they are treating me. 
I’m wondering where to go from here…should I try to maintain some sort of relationship with my sisters, or remove myself from the picture? It would be an easier call to make if it were just me, but I have kids who miss seeing their cousins. 
Needless to say, my husband is extremely upset about everything that happened and doesn’t want our family to have anything to do with my parents and the sisters who see them regularly. If the situation were reversed, I’d feel the same way, but because it’s me, and these are the people I grew up with, I’m struggling. Any insights appreciated. 🙏🏼"

"One of my earliest memories from childhood goes back to when i was no more than 3 years old. I was in the preschool parking lot with my mom and dad. My mom would dig her thumb into the bottom of my shoulder bone, where it really hurt, to make me cry. Obviously she did it so smoothly my dad never noticed. I remember screaming and crying in pain from the top of my lungs and she was so cynically saying “awww poor baby why are you crying” and continue and continue. I remember my dad just standing there thinking it was me. This behavior continued throughout my life. Once she got better with her technology, she would film me crying. I remember growing up the abuse had gotten so bad by the time i got to school i was always to torn up. When i was 8, i ran away to my neighbors house for help and he called child protective services. The problem though is that she is so good at pretending to be the best mom, so they did nothing to help me. 
I still managed to make friends though. The problem was whenever i made friends she would get in the way of my relationships with them. I remember in 4th grade she asked one of my guy friends if she was prettier than me. I hope he doesn’t remember that. Whenever i got close to someone, she would ruin the relationship, and sometimes even yell at my friends. Flash forward to senior year of high school: i had gotten into an argument with one of my friends and my mom saw her at starbucks and threatened her. Obviously her mom called the cops on my mom. To this day, my mom blames that on me, blames me for getting the cops called on her. She accuses me of drugs and being involved with the cartel. Currently she is accusing me of plotting a hate crime to kill her with cartel people. The most absurd things come out of her mouth. I don’t understand it. I genuinely try so hard to be good to her, and i have tried so hard in my life to be successful. I am at a top university right now and her facebook is filled with all my accomplishments she takes from my linkedin. She takes credit for every one of my accomplishments. When all she has done is make me want to kill myself from the youngest age because i never thought i would be able to escape her. Im back home for summer now and its absolutely miserable. I forgot how abusive and toxic she was. I dont know how i am going to push through these next months. I would cut her out but i have a younger sister who needs my love. 



Her behavior just doesnt make sense to me. She acts like everyone is a threat to her . Accuses people of drugs, gang violence, etc. but really its only her that is the problem.

 There is so much i have to say though and since i am on a rant i want to say one more thing. From a young age she started telling me my dad was a pedophile. She wouldn’t let me wear shorts or anything revealing around the house because of him. She told me it wasnt normal for him to hug me and that he always stares as me weird. So i grew up fearing my dad only to realize he wasnt even a problem. But they are 23 years apart. "
theres deffo some sick twisted reason like what
like ever since i was young my mom used to verbally bause me like everyday

how tf can my mother say that my child abuse scars are self harm just to defend herself and so she doesn't get in trouble
so strange
like their reaction does not quantify what happened.before i got skapped for complainign their was no cereal left like wtf
like ther is no logical reason that you should slap a two year old and force her to kneel down in a corner just bceause she snatched some choclates after another girls hand

"Ok so I was at my bf's but my dad knows them as my bsf. He called like 30 times in 3 mins. My ringer was off so I didn't hear it. He went to their house cuz we were out somewhere with their mom. I called back and he was yelling abt my room cuz it wasnt thoroughly clean. I had to go home even tho I was supposed to stay the night. At home I was yelled at for A WHILE. I was crying in the bathroom more than I ever had cried b4. 
We were yelling at eachother through the door. When I came out of the bathroom he was really pissed and yelling at me. We fought for a while and I ended up having a panic attack. I could barely breathe, I was gasping for breath, grasping at my chest, and abt to fall backwards. He looks at me and tells me to calm down, stop being dramatic, and breathe. He told me if I kept it up I'd never see my friend(bf) ever again, be shipped to a private school, and a boarding school. I was freaking out and didn't know what to do. I'm grounded for 2 weeks and he hasn't taken my phone YET. It's also break rn and I just wanted to spend some time with my bf. He's completely disregard it from that point. Edit: I'm gonna add a little more context abt my bf. They're gender fluid and were born as a girl. My dad thinks that he's just my best friend. It's nothing to do with them for him. It's a lot to do with them for me tho. They are my safe space. I was told I could stay the night then I was later in the day told he never said that even though he did and watched me leave with them. More context abt me: I am a transmasc (female to male). Me and my partner have been dating for 5 and a half months. We write each other letters in ELA. Im not tonna say the whole letter but I'll break it down. They said that they love me very very much and they hope that this won't be a dumb highschool relationship. In my letter I also said a lot but I told them ik it won't I'm not going anywhere."
"So a little context I was mentally and physically abused growing up and when I got older I started abusing drugs. I’ve always had issues sleeping, as in sleeping for way too long but I would very rarely dream and if I did it was apocalyptic fighting for my life. Well recently I quit abusing drugs and I find myself having these end of the world dreams daily and they are super vivid I can remember every single detail. 
Has anyone else experienced anything like this? The dreams aren’t necessarily scary it’s almost like I enjoy them though I absolutely hate scary movies.

"Just been wondering about this since I don't think I'll ever really recover.

Has anyone here recovered either fully or mostly from the abuse they suffered as a child?

I understand that this place in some ways is not the best place to ask this. I imagine that a lot of the people who completely or mostly recover are not on this subreddit (anymore). But I'm not sure where else to ask the question so..."
"You've probably already seen this story in this community, but as a kid I remember one day my dad was angry for some reason. He walked up to my brother punched him in the nose and made his nose bleed. It wouldn't stop bleeding for a while and we almost had to go to the hospital. I did not protect him somehow like an older brother is supposed to do. What bothers me the most about it is that I didn't think much of it. I actually laughed at my brother. I thought stuff like that was normal. I failed to show him any kind of empathy. This is why I feel I can't get close to others. Because I know I will hurt them due to my lack of empathy. I don't want to hurt anybody. I can't be trusted."
"I F19, am back at home living with my parents after developing a chronic illness at university. My parents swear up and down that they will treat me like an adult. They haven't and its been frustrating but its fine because at least I'm not paying rent. So let me start off by saying this, my dad is a veteran with ptsd and bipolar disorder, so his life has not been easy by any means. Neither has my moms. From as little as 3, I remember my dad being angry all the time, for no reason too. I remember coming home to him strangling my dog one day because the dog made my dad mad by making noise. I've feared him ever since. And even though he gets help through the VA, its never gotten any better. I always feared that he might hurt my sister, mom, or I. A few years back, my sister who was 17 at the time, was upset because her school gave her a big project to do over the weekend and my dad was forcing her to do the chores, so I stepped in and did the chores so she could focus on school, no big deal at all. Well, my dad put our dogs outside in the blistering heat, and my sister tried to let my moms dog in because he couldn't breathe in the sun like that (boston terrior). Well he got angry and said he would kill that dog, and my sister started crying, so he got even more mad and stormed after her and said he would snap both of our necks in a second and not feel bad about it. So I went to our garage and sent my mom a text, basically the equivalence of a goodbye because I thought we would be dead by the time she got home at 11 that night from work. Well my mom and dad fought and she apologized to us and he swore he would get help. Well, for a while he didn't do anything wrong, and then he slowly started again. My sister was gone so all he had to get angry at was me. I refuse to help him with any projects because he gets angry and i have panic attacks and start trembling uncontrollably and you can't build a porch when you are trembling like crazy. He also is unemployed right now due to being on disability from the VA, so he gets bored, and he has this image in his mind that women are below him and that because i'm a daughter, i should do his laundry and get his food and do his chores, and he refuses to put his trash in the trashcan and leaves it all around the house. I'm returning to a local university in a few months, so I'm trying to count down the days. He gets angry when my grandmother calls my mom, and says he wishes she would disappear, she's never done anything but tried to care for him. I fell asleep the other day because I'm sick, and he handed me this remote to the ac, well I didn't know why he did that and neither did he, so i sat it on the tissue box and it accidentally fell in, no big deal, except i woke up to him quiet yelling at my mom about where it was, and i heard him tell her that he was going to beat me up, and he was dead serious. Of course, he has no clue what i'm talking about when i mentioned it to him while he was in a good mood today. And then he started working outside this evening and was mad I was doing college preparations and couldn't stop and help him, and he walked through the house holding a screwdriver and said he was going to stab us (my mom and i) as his idea of a joke i guess? But i know he wasn't joking, he always tries to hide it as a dark humor joke i guess. But he also beats our dogs, especially this one old dog of ours, she's the sweetest little girl, and my mom originally didn't want anymore animals after our last group died because it was too hard, and he said we needed pets, so he took my mom to visit this pig (he knew my mom is soft-hearted) and so we brought the baby pig home because he was being abused, and now my mom is trapped with my dad. I know thats why he did it too, if she didn't have the animals she could leave him and be able to go to her moms house and he didn't want that. You can't easily lift a full grown pig, not a hog, but pigs are still fat and heavy either way. I just wish he could understand the pain he's put us through, whether he meant to or not. I understand he had a bad childhood and a hard life, but now my sister and I are really messed up and not even medication can help. I want to get out so bad but I can't bring myself to leave knowing my mom and animals could get hurt, and my mom would actually try to hurt herself if she didn't have her animals... I just hate that I have to live this way when I never asked to be born... The hardest part of it all is the fact that I still love him, and the thought of leaving him makes me sick, because I still have hope that one day he might turn out to be the dad I always needed him to be... Anyways thanks for reading this, I just needed somewhere to vent about this I guess without worrying my family or burdening my friends. Advice is welcome! Also I would like to add, just because someone is mentally ill or has Bipolar disorder, that does not automatically mean they are abusive or toxic, so no stigmatizing please. "
I don’t have a good relationship with my parents. They treat me very poorly and I have some family friends that I’m with at least 5 times a week and have been for years and I’m still really close with them and talk almost every day. They are like parents to me and love me like I’m their own child. I wanted to know if it would be okay to ask them if they would be by child’s “grandparents”? I want them to be an important part of my child’s life like they are mine. Not sure what to do. Need opinions! 
"I (F22) have just had enough of living at home. My little sister (F14), is still in junior high so she has no place to really go except enrolling in her high school come summer term next year. I have the opportunity to move out next summer, because I am thinking of pursuing a masters degree in a city or province away from my home. I just don't know what's going to happen when I am not there to mitigate the domestic abuse my parents engage in, the arguments and violence that just occurs in my household.

  
For context: my home has always had its share of abuse. My father is physically and verbally abusive, and has been abusive towards my mother and I ever since I can remember. His physical abuse stopped when I turned 18, after an argument we had that left me with purple bruising around my stomach. I finally stood up to him and told him to stop abusing me once and for all. I essentially threatened to runaway. Our home was content for a few years after that. Until I turned 21, he and I were rebuilding our relationship. But last summer he had an affair with a person from our community and this really destroyed our family. His stupidity continuously lasted for months. From August 2023 to the present day, our family has not had peace. My mother has endured and tremendous amount of physical abuse and emotional damage. She has also become very abusive towards us and my father. Mentally tormenting us with her emotions, outburst and back handed comments. It's a complete war zone. The courts and the police have been involved, but my parents rather stay together in an extremely toxic enviornemt. They have cultivated the most gruesome space for my sister and I to live in, we are completely overwhelmed each day. I try my best to handle it all, be there for everyone and take it so that my little sister is spared, but she has bared witness the violence too unfortunately.

With all this happening at home, I was going through a siginificat amount of suffering in my previous relationship. My ex was mentally and verbally abusive. I should have left the first time I saw the signs, but at least now I know where the mindset of ""staying with an abusive partner"" came from. It has been demonstrated to me my entire life. My mother even persuaded and encouraged me to stay with this individual. She told me that I will never find better. 

  
The only silver lining I can find in all this, my little sister and I got really close. Even with our age gap we are able to communicate better, reflect, relate and have each other's backs. 

Now I have the opportunity to leave. Financially it will be a strain, but I rather deal with financial struggle than lose my battle to mental health because of the chaos at home. 

How do I leave my little sister though? Will she be okay? Will my parents end up killing each other if I am not home to control everything? 



Please Help:("

Title is pretty self explanatory. Tonight my dad dropped a framed picture and it shattered all over the floor. He reacted to this inconvenience in his usual rational way by screaming, swearing, throwing things across the room, and threatening to kill himself. He leaves and slams the door, leaving us to clean up (because for some reason it’s always our responsibility). 

He comes back 10 minutes later screaming at my mom for something completely irrelevant. Something to do with how she works too much and it’s not how a family should be (ironic coming from him - an abusive narcissist). My mom doesn’t make that much money and earns her salary from commission, meaning she has to work a shit ton. 

This argument had nothing to do with the original reason why he got so upset but it always somehow comes back to us. He threatened to leave, saying “this is the last f**king time I’m saying this otherwise dad will one day disappear.” And then screaming “IS THAT F**KING CLEAR” to my mom while she’s cleaning his mess on her hands and knees. 

I can’t take this anymore. It’s constant walking on egg shells and he knows he completely controls the family since he makes more money than my mom. I’m an only child and can’t live like this anymore but if I leave I’m scared he’ll eventually do something to my mom and I won’t be here to stop him. I can’t even bother trying to help her because she will end up projecting her anger onto me instead of my dad

I’ve been taking antidepressants that have seemed to help my depression but how am I supposed to get any better when I’m surrounded by this?"
"So I'm f15 and I weigh 60 kgs, not overweight but I've been insecure of my weight since I could spell weight. This summer I wanted a glow up, I wanted to get skinny basically so I started starving myself, I've done it before, it's just earlier I lied I ate and had a bad stomach but this time I did the mistake of telling them the truth, my mother is the better parent she's a good mom but my dad...
I hadn't eaten for 2 days and all of a sudden when I'm making coffee in the kitchen which also took so much self convincing that I should finally have something and I was going to make a cappuccino. He came and started calling me a mf and how I'm mad and have i gone mad to not eat and I was submissive to it all until he started shouting on my mother which he always does for someone else's faults and i screamed that it's not her fault and my grandfather came and told me how my dad loved me and it pained him to see me starving which ik was lie. I went to my room and my father told me I'm a fcking bitch and not deserving of anything and if I get his anger up he will kill me. After somethings my mom said to him he just came to hug me out of nowhere, everytime he cusses me out to the point where I won't say such things to a rock let alone my daughter and he never says sorry but just hugs me and acts like nothing happened. This time I didn't let him hug me and he threatened to beat the shit out of me again and left saying that how I wish he was dead and how we ruin his day and my mother told me I was disrespectful. 
After that I went into the shower and screamed for half an hour and TW cut myself- 
I feel like i didn't deserve all that and if he was concerned he could have just told me that it is important to eat and he can't see me hurting but he chose to call me a mf and how he didn't want to go through the trouble of getting me to a hospital. I'm sorry i just needed to rent, I feel like he will break me soon if he's like this 
PS -basically he was having a bad day and ofc he takes it out on me"

Preface; my ex wanted me to get an abortion for me to have a chance with him again and to hang out with me for this festival. I lied to him saying I did it but then out of spite when he stood me up I told him I was pregnant and sent his parents the ultrasound pics 


First of all, I want to say I am getting help. I just work full-time so it’s hard to find an available counselor when I’m working so this weekend was EDC Las Vegas, which is known as a huge music festival that happens in Vegas my ex told me he would hang out with me all weekend if I acted properly I’m not going to lie. I did take a little bit of mushrooms And he decided to hang out with me all weekend. He said he promised he would see me then he stood up. I told his mom and dad that I’m still pregnant sent them the ultrasound pictures and then I ask his friends where he was during the concert the day he stood me up.

 I asked all of them and then I told him sorry I was acting crazy. I’m pregnant with my ex and that’s why I’m behaving like such.  Then I was really mad that he stood me up, but I didn’t realize how Mad I  was when I told his parents I was pregnant and his friends. so I told him meet me downstairs outside of your hotel because I deserve a kiss and a hug and he didn’t really want to like I’m outside so we came down and then he just gave me a huge hug and then he yelled in my ear saying you’re so fucking stupid you broke your promise. You promised me you would do the abortion and that was the promise you made in order for me to hang out with you during this festival. I fully regret telling him I’m still pregnant because he fully believed I did the abortion already so I should’ve just kept that a secret.


 I just acted so emotionally crazy because he stood me up the day. I then acted more crazy on Monday or excuse me Tuesday. I called his work six times and then his boss called me saying if I keep harassing him he will call the police. I really hope he doesn’t do that reason to get a restraining order due to what I ’m doing. I really like my ex and I would do anything to get him back but I know he’s not going to stay with me forever so I’m keeping this kid and making sure it has the best life I can. Anyways, I know I made some post on this sub Reddit, but I am not allowed to comment on my own post because I don’t have enough comment karma so if you want to direct message me feel free. I need people to talk to. I have a discord if you want to add me, I need support such as someone to talk to. I really want to work it out with my ex but what should I do? 


Should I just leave him alone? I went so crazy and I felt so bad for doing that. I am slowly falling in love with the kid,  but I had so much fun with my ex. I don’t want to lose him you guys, but with everything I did with me having no self-control and no common sense and no respect for his privacy going on the verge of blackmailing him like I’m telling all his friends and family that pregnant, so the people who say I should give it up for adoption this is my baby and I’m going to take good care of my baby. Do you guys think I blew it with my ex? Should I stop caring about my ex and just focus on the baby? "
"TL;DR: I (18F) survived an abusive relationship that worsened in college, leading to cheating and violence. After ending it, I lost my friends and returned to my abusive mother’s home. Now, I'm struggling to focus on my studies while dealing with feeling completely alone.

I (18F) survived an abusive relationship, and I couldn’t feel more alone. I met him (19M) during high school, and we fell hard for each other. Our relationship was good back then. He was there for me when my mother kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go. However, it all changed when I got to college. He was upset that I couldn’t spend as much time with him because I was focusing on school. I’m a pre-med student, so school can get very consuming at times.

A couple of months later, he came over to spend the night (I had no roommate). That morning, I woke up to use the bathroom, and something told me to check his phone. I landed on Reddit, where I discovered several messages from different girls and couples. In the messages, he requested to have sex with them and give them drugs in return. He’s a recovering addict, but these messages only confirmed that he was neither clean nor faithful. He left that morning, and we didn't speak for about a month. Foolishly, I let him back into my life. You can imagine it only got worse. Cheating escalated to verbal and physical attacks.

We finally ended it a week ago. I do feel free from the shackles of that relationship, but I lost my friends in the process. They knew about all he did to me and encouraged me to leave him. With them, I felt the courage to do so, but that would only last a few days before I was back with him. The last day I spoke to any of them was a week ago, the same day he and I ended things. I can’t blame them for leaving. People get tired, and I understand that we all need to protect our peace. I just feel utterly rejected and alone.

One of them contacted my sister and told her what was going on. My sister told my mom, and it's been nothing but hell since I’ve been back for summer vacation. My mother has done nothing but tear me down since. Growing up, she was incredibly verbally and physically abusive (way more than my ex was). I vividly remember one Sunday morning, getting a drink from the kitchen. She had just finished cleaning that morning, and I accidentally got bleach on the dress I was going to wear to church. She beat me senselessly, tore the dress off my body, and left me in the living room naked and scared. We still went to church that morning. 

I feel like that is part of the reason I clung to my ex because he mimicked what I was used to. I don't know where to go from here. I don’t know what to do. Right now, I’m focusing on my education, but it feels impossible. My mother threatens to stop paying for my education all the time, even though I’m doing well. She praises everything my sister does, even if it's mediocre. She never says she's proud of me; any compliment she gives me is backhanded. How will I stay mentally sane while getting the education and dream career I want?"
"I,(F18)am still living with my parents and it is slowly killing me. This might be a long one so hold your pants.

I graduated highschool in 2023 and I'm working full time, going to a trade school this september, I have my own car, I make sure my bills are paid, etc. Yet my parents argument for not letting me leave is that I am not ready. They say that my mental health is too bad and that I need to stay at home with them until I'm done school. Believe me, that is the last thing I want. Long story short, I was their golden child until I got to my senior year of HS and they started to lose respect for me, all because I started smoking weed and going out a bit late. Anyway, they had so much hope for me and even I feel that I let them down a bit because I had dropped out of Uni and started doing the stuff they didn't like. They held their standards for me too high and now I can't do anything right. All I want is the support and respect from my parents for my decision to want to move out. They still give me so many restrictions even though I am 19 at the end of this year. All I want is my own space and freedom to grow as a person and be able to adapt on my own. Yes, I do struggle with my mental health but holding me in that house, giving me a curfew of 11 on a Saturday and shaming me for smoking isn't helping me. 

I really need advice for what to do. Thanks everyone    "
"I (21 F) have been considering confronting my parents about all the things that they've done because I think that it would be cathartic. However, I'm scared, understandably so.

Hi ,  I am a 23 f living in my family home with my boyfriend 25m . I am writing this as I don’t know if my feelings are valid , and if so, what I need to do . But if not, how I need to look at myself. 

I’ve struggled my whole life with mental health and self esteem, however even writing that makes me feel like a prick, as I know others have it worse.

Ever since I was little, I remember being screamed and shouted at for the most simple things- dropping orange juice , not being able to get my maths right. I just remember being teased and called names :stupid, a clown , idiot, sometimes even slapped a little. Thinking back to that even now, I still feel cold and scared. 
I would be moaned at for absolutely everything! Not wanting to wear dresses, or go out , or having my shoes up to loose. I just remember being stressed all of the time. I would hide behind buildings and trees to escape them as I had no where else to go at the age of 4-10. To this day, I’m still made fun of for having doing this. 
I started developing weird fears because of the stress: I was deeply traumatised by the idea of batteries running out, or being late and the worst of all (still to this day) high ceilings.
I remember feeling very alone, and I would cry to try and get love and affection, to stop their anger , anything to make it stop for a moment !  If the crying didn’t work, I would cry louder and louder , but it always resulted in headaches and being left on the floor alone.

There was always these weird self image threats and issues . If I misbehaved, my mum would threaten to cut all of my hair off … which is kinda ducked up as it taught me that beauty is measured by hair length . Also that I had to straighten my hair for events and that I shouldn’t eat too much or I’ll get fat and ugly.

My parents would also search through my room every single moment, in every single corner. Secretly putting spyware on my phones . They would never tell me this but make suspicious comments and like jokes at topics I’d researched or messages I sent … which made me very on edge and embarrassed ! 

My dad was quite emotionally up and down also, you never knew what thing would spark what reaction or the classic “you kids took up all my time and made me fat”. But when I was little he would play with me and talk to me lots ! Which was great, he was my safe space 

Then when I hit around 11, it all got much much much worse. My dad would, self admittedly “not know how to talk to me, and completely emotionally abandon me. My mother, would be always like a hot and cold firework, I never felt comfortable around her trigger.

So, I started looking to other adult figures and role models. Absorbing their personalities and style to an unhealthy degree. Most of these role models were men, as the only female role model I had would critique herself and me in the most negative way… so why would I want to be that? ! 

So I started not eating lunch and binding my hips so that they wouldn’t grow. I didn’t want to become that. This got worse and worse and worse as the years went on , becoming more depressed and finding new ways to destroy myself. 
But I still felt this urge to HAVE TO ACT NORMAL and KEEP up my grades .
My biggest focus was art, as when I was little my mum would big me up and boast to all the other mums about how great my art was. It made me feel important, and if I wasn’t the best in the school, then I was any use , not good enough. 

As my weight dropped to 5 stone at the age of 15  , I was so so so poorly. I thought that  it would be the cry for help that my parents needed , much like my childhood crying, it need to get louder until I was heard. But it wasn’t, much like my crying it was just met with an even bigger and angrier RAGE ! My mum would hit me and call me a freak , threatening to call for me to be taken to “the mad house” … but weirdly never did call anyone. She would secretly take pictures of my body to keep on her phone, and compare photos of me then , to the previous year . She would grab me and belittle me , really psychopathically calling me too weak to fight her , and to just “let her win”, as she tried to pin me down. 
She would always tell me that “she didn’t do anything to deserve this” and “all of the other mums are talking about you and it’s embarrassing” and the constant CLASSIC “how do you think this makes me feel”

On one particular morning , I remember it being so bad , that I climbed out of my window and ran to school when she tried to lock me in. I went upstairs to the mental health room. For the first time, adults didn’t ask about my weight, they just treated me like a real human and not a possession/freak. That was the first time I felt comfortable eating in months and months. 

This continued on up until a few years ago. I was Still looking to role male models and was obsessed with the idea of having an older boyfriend to look after me and care for me. It’s all I would dream about and write about. But of course , this lead to a lot of male mental and physical abuse and being with narcissistic men. 


Basically to sum this all up, I’m moving out with my current partner into a house soon (woo) and whilst I’m still living at home, I feel fucking miserable, an anxious shell. I’m a tattoo artist now , and I can’t focus on my drawings during the day , In fear of the door swinging open and being screamed at for simple things. My dad doesn’t talk to me , he gets all weird and jittery when I’m near. My mother continues to belittle me and control everything I do, but more from just a traumatised Brain. She makes me feel ugly for every tattoo that I get , yet demands that I tattoo her whenever she feels like it. All because “she helped me get the job” .  She ruined my 21st birthday as we share a birthday and it was “her big day” …. Just everything is about how she feels !!!!!!!!!!!!.!:!!;:)£:,):£:)2£:2)):£/&:

I feel deeply on edge as uncomfortable around them both , I feel like a Shell of a human myself and I am absolutely sick and tired of it all. I’m not perfect , but fuck me im THEIR CHILD. Whenever I try to speak to her about anything that she doesn’t agree with (about herself or things that I want to do/ make me unhappy) she just shouts louder than I can calmly explain.

Should I ditch them ? When I move out should I stop contact . She already said that she wants a key and to come over lots , and to have a tracker on my phone . She also got angry when I said no . I just don’t think that I can live my own life and feel free until she’s dead or blocked honestly…  I just feel so tired and broken, like a bird in a cage 


What should I do ? 
Thank you "
"I’m 42f. My dad was verbally and emotionally abusive my whole life. He’s not actively evil or anything, I know. But he has a talent for impulsively saying the very worst thing that a person could possibly say. It’s (figuratively) almost like he has a demon inside him, just waiting to take control and make him say the one thing that will get past a person’s armor and hurt the worst. When I was growing up, his rage was an all-consuming fire. He’s said things that will haunt me until I die. He’s the voice of my inner critic, always telling me how worthless I am, even now. 

Anyway, I grew up and moved out. Dad went on medication, but it only barely keeps him from getting arrested for yelling at waitresses and such. He’s tried every dosage of everything under the sun (under medical supervision.) He knows he was a terrible husband and father. I know he recognizes he has a problem and is trying to change. But still, whenever I see him (even as an adult,) I have to walk on eggshells. Whatever his deep-down intentions, his words are still not the words of a kind man. And I have very little self confidence. 

At this point, I’m very low contact with him.  We live 15 minutes apart, but I see him maybe 3-4 times a year. Well, today my mom (they are divorced but still in contact) texted to say that Dad says he misses me and loves me. I know it’s probably true. I know he really does feel bad for what he’s done to my mom, my sister and I. But I also know that he repeatedly told me growing up that having kids was the worst thing he ever did and he would unalive himself if my mom got pregnant again. So there’s that.

So right now, I’m torn between feeling like I’m coldly taking out my bitterness on an old man who can’t help himself and feeling like I’m doing the right thing by protecting myself. I feel so guilty. Part of me wonders if I should offer to take him out to lunch to mend fences a bit. But the thought just ties my stomach in knots because I know the conversation would just devolve into him saying something terrible. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this. Maybe I’m just venting and trying to work through things. Thank you for listening.

"i'm 23 years old. i just completely cut off contact with my parents today and while i know that it is probably for the best, i feel so guilty and sad and. well, mostly just really sad. i miss the people that they could have been to me. my mom has had a really hard life. she is horrible to me and extremely manipulative, but i also feel so sad for her. i love her and i want to be able to be there for her. but that's also not my job i guess. I'M the child. 

for context, i moved out when i was 17. i haven't been on good terms with my parents probably since i was 9. i've cut off contact with them once before, a few years ago, but we reconnected after i had a medical emergency. for a while (like a month lol) i really did think things were better. that maybe they had changed and they do love me. but since then we have gotten in some really nasty arguments, especially with my dad. they have made it very clear that they hate everything i am and everything i care about and stand for. they take every opportunity to insult and belittle me. and they have both returned to their manipulative, narcissistic habits. still, i was willing to put up with it and just have sort of limited contact. 

the thing that changed recently was that they stopped doing the bare minimum to care for my continued survival. they refused to cosign my lease to ensure that i would have a place to live for the next year. i havent relied on them financially since i moved out. all i really have needed from them is to fill out the FAFSA form for student loans and to cosign my leases so i can have a place to live. i work, i have an excellent credit score, and i have never missed a rent payment, but because i dont make 3x rent landlords still require a cosigner. anyway, so they said because they dont approve of my ""lifestyle"" they wont cosign. (i found a different cosigner, so that is okay).

so, i sent them a message basically saying that they cannot really be considered parents as they dont fulfill any parental responsibilities towards me, and they clearly do not like me as a person, so there is no reason to continue having a relationship. then i blocked them. but ive been crying about it literally for hours. it really hurts. i dont know what else i could have done. i know this really hurt my mom especially. 

tl;dr
i blocked my parents, am sad and guilty about it. "
"that man can and will drink himself into an early grave, and ii don't know what to do. Not that I care, because trust me, I don't. But it is genuinely turning our household into a depressive prison.

drunk, he's thrown a chair at us leaving holes in the wall, and broken another chair purely out of anger for telling him to stop drinking. 

He breaks of alcohol, he's lost his license as many times as you can to drink driving, he's had drink related accidents, I don't know what to do. I feel as if everything on my shoulders, and I have 5 siblings and I cant just leave them so I don't know what to do. Please man"

"For some back story: my sister 32F was with her baby dad 32M for almost 10 years. He was extremely controlling and abusive to her in every way. It took her getting pregnant and having her baby (my niece) to finally have the strength to leave him because she needed to protect her baby. When she was home from the hospital, he couldn’t handle her crying as a newborn. He came into the bedroom screaming to shut the baby up. He pulled out a gun and pointed it at my newborn niece, and then to his own head. That was when my sister knew she had to get away from him.the next day she came to my family for help and we moved her out. She got a protective order against him and they had a really nasty case I. Court against each other. Cps came to interview her and I was there for support and it was the first time I had seen my sister cry in over a decade recounting to the cps what he did to her. In court, he lied so much about my sister and he got away with all of it because the law protects him as a parent too and there wasn’t enough evidence. That same cps worker high fived the dad after court that day. Years later, and multiple court hearing later as his tactic of draining our family of money, he continues to be the same person he always was. My niece is much older now, and able to vocalize his actions. She says that he grabs her arm out of no where and twists it, that he “grounds” her for “lying” about brushing her hair or showering when she says she is telling the truth- so he locks her in her room for hours. She says he tells her she is fat (she is actually very very skinny) and that her teeth are crooked and ugly- she has had many breakdowns before school because of this because he has messed up her self esteem so bad. She said he tickles her out of no where so hard that it hurts and it makes her cry. And now yesterday when she came back from her dads, she said he pushed her really hard when she was climbing into the car “because she was taking too long” and she hit the top of her head really hard. She still had a bump on her head and then woke up this morning with very blurry vision so we took her to urgent care immediately and got her checked out and a Cat scan that we are still waiting for the results for. Please any advice on what we can do. We are terrified of what he will do to punish her if we don’t succeed in getting the law to protect her after so many attempts already. If we file a police report, what will he do if he still gets regular custody? He is about to have her for 3 weeks for the start of summer. It would be too long to share how much more there is to this case, but he has gotten away with everything he has ever done. I’m so scared that he will kidnap her or punish her for telling us, or come up with another lie to take my sister to court as retaliation like he’s done before."

"I need some advice from my fellow netizens here. I’m also partly venting as my mental health has gone to the dump in light of recent events. I would like to know whether it’s a good idea to move out of my home. 

For better context: 

I stay in an Indian household and have been raised by an abusive parent. I’ve been subjected to a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my dad during my childhood. I don’t have any fond memories of good times associated with him. The abuse became emotional after I grew up and started fighting back. and hit a peak in 2018 (I was studying for my Masters Degree at the time)

I feel like I have spent a large chunk of my life just trying to undo the damage and step away from a cycle of hatred. I’ve taken help in the form of therapy. 

After a lot of work, I came to a position where I forgave him. Things seemed to be tolerable for a while. It seemed like he was changing as a person, but the truth of the matter is that he lies constantly. I’ve become slightly more confrontational over the years.

Here’s the problem -

Recently he went on an outburst bringing up everything from our past. He told me how ashamed he was of me. He also had issues with me going to therapy and helping myself. He told me that whatever I have done till now amounts to nothing. 

I don’t have a mainstream career. I’m an entrepreneur who runs a media and marketing agency. I feel like it’s struggling though we operate with a profit month on month (only barely). Unfortunately the company that funded my start up invested is connected to my dad, so we work on the same floor.

Since the pandemic I’ve chosen to stay with my family. I can survive living by myself financially (maintain my current lifestyle by saving approx 15% of my salary). Financially it makes more sense to stay at home as I save approx. 80% of my salary, and I’ve saved enough money to look after myself for the next 2 years alone. 

My confidence levels are at one of my lowest so far. I’m feeling useless and hopeless about the future. Don’t know what to do next. I fear that I’ll end up on the streets. It feels like this person is keeping my family hostage by using the fact that he is the main provider for my family. I want to look after my mom and sister as well in the future. But all family members associated with him end up miserable, unhappy and poor. If I stay back, I would be there to provide support for my mom and sister. "
"I wish they said they loved me and meant it. I wish they didn't abuse me for just existing as a disabled person. I wish they didn't treat the things I asked them to do as monumental tasks that are SUCH big inconveniences. I wish they didn't treat me like I'm stupid and can't take care of myself as if I haven't been doing that for years. On top of taking care of them. 

I wish it didn't take five minutes alone with them to turn a good day into an emotional spiral. I wish they didn't make me wish harm on them for making me feel so bad. I wish I didn't wish one of us were dead. I wish I didn't have to run away from support and a stable home in order survive because the emotional abuse is taking that much of a toll. 

I wish they gave me credit for how hard it is to exist like this as it is. I wish they acknowledged my struggling instead of acting like I'm putting more on their shoulders for just existing. I wish I didn't feel like a burden. I wish I didn't feel like killing myself. I wish I didn't feel so depressed. I wish I could talk to them about my feelings with them saying ""no you don't feel that way"" or getting defensive, or saying ""everyone's tired"". 

I wish things were different, I wish they were different. I wish they didn't make me cry so much. I wish they didn't make it hard to cry. I wish they had remorse. "
"Abusive dad? Enabling mom? 


I was suggested to post here so
Here it goes.

Myy oldest brother left home

Hi.

A long long time ago my oldest half sister left home due to my abusive dad. Things gotten better over time with him but not entirely. My next oldest sister left home and joined the military (but sides with him kinda thing so I don’t think he was the reason she left home entirely). I left home 6 years ago due to my dad. My oldest brother just recently left home in October due to my dad. That leaves my youngest brother left living with him and my mom. 

What the fuck is happening? My oldest brother says that he hoped that him leaving too will result in my dad noticing that HES been the problem. But it doesn’t seem like it. What can this say about you as a parent with 3 maybe 4 of your 5 kids leave you? How can a mom feel? (She used to watch us get in fights and beat on by him and do nothing. I was told by my oldest sister he used to abuse our mom but I was really young and remember my mom and my
Siblings and I going to a women’s shelter for a few days to get away from him) but what!!!  

I honestly can’t really wrap my head around what’s wrong with my dad? Or why my mom sits and watches? Or why this isn’t talked about amongst me and my siblings? Idk"
"My dad has always been verbally abusive. He's called me all the names under the sun. He threatens to destroy and break my things and freaks out if I move or touch things that are things for everyone to use in the house. My mum doesn't do much to help me as she's always working during the week, and I'm left at home with him as he's unemployed and has been my whole life. He's an abusive control freak and idk what to do. I suffer with extreme mental health issues and am struggling to get a job and he bully's me for not having a job when he literally doesn't have one and im trying to get one and have for a little while, having literally just finished university. I'm not sure what to do because even at my boyfriends house, his mum is a control freak psycho.
Any advice I would be greatful for, I'm not in a great place at the moment"
"for context i got my period 2 weeks after my 12th birthday and iv always had endometriosis so iv always had a pretty heavy flow. but my mom would only buy me light and regular pads so i would go thru them pretty often. about 1 pad an hour. she never really educated me about periods, just that its when a woman goes through puberty and it makes your stomach hurt and you bleed. that was it. so i didnt know to ask for thicker pads i didnt know thicker existed i just assumed shed buy me what i needed. but one day i asked for more pads bc i ran out and she got really upset with me saying shes seen all the pads in the trash and im going thru them to fast. i explained that they were full and after 1-2 hrs they wouldnt aborb anymore blood it would get on my pants and underwear and u could clearly see that they were soaked all the way thru. she just huffed at me and said they should last 7 hrs per pad and left and after a while came back with a box of tampons. for also a little more context. my mom also has very bad endometriosis but also only uses tampons NEVER pads and had always made fun of me for wearing pads.she said i needed to figure out how to use them bc shes not buying pads anymore since i was ""wasting"" them and to read the back of the box and just figure it out if i didnt wanna bleed on myself.i kept trying to use them but i was barly 12 I had an extremely thick hymen that it just wouldn't go thru and they just hurt so badly so for a while i just had to use them long ways or stuff toilet paper in my underwear. but i had a few nice friends at school that would give me pads and i found out a specific bathroom at the school I was in always had period products and so for months i just did that and never asked her again. am i wrong? was this abuse? shes always been very strange about my period and how it could never be as bad as her and im just so so lucky even tho i also hav endometriosis i just stage 1-2 ands shes stage 4. shes forced me to free bleed several times when i was young aswell."

I'm done. After the last conversation we've had I realized I'm done living on survival mode when he is home. The convo boils down to this: (me) ""it's horrible to fear my own dad, to feel anxious when you're around and feeling like I'm walking on eggshells"", (him) ""that's on you for living in the past. Don't provoque me then""


That last part showed me, finally, how little he undertsands about this, and how unwilling he is to even consider that he is damaging. I opened up when telling him what I wrote above, my throat was in a knot, it was hard to talk, tears, I tried communicating it in many ways. The fact that he responded the way he did was the last straw. Maybe before I just didn't want to acknowledge it, on a subconscious level even. But now I'm unable to avoid it. The conclusion is clear: domestic abuse. 


I'm limiting my contact with him to the bare minimum. That is, what's needed to live: stuff around the house, logistics, things involving the other family members. That's it. I'm done trying to foster a warm father son relationship. No fucking discussing the Champions League final. Yes, I've seen the match. You too? Ok. Cool. Yeah. Aha. Ok. *Goes to another room*


That and therapy. I finally understand I've been living in the shadow of fear, of fearing my own fucking dad and living in a state of survival for years. A threat in our own home. I see that I've diminished myself. Already looking for psychologists. Do you recommend a specific specialization? I'm thinking one experienced in domestic violence. I've heard great things about somatic stuff, eye movement, that kind of thing. In my view the body does ""keep the score"" and I can sometimes feel it even. 


God... So many years of wondering why can't I socialize normally, why do I feel so insecure, etc etc... All the while knowing deep down that my true self is not like that in any way.


And for anybody that might need to hear this: abusers can love too, it doesn't have to feel contradicting to cut them off from your life even when you see through their pain and know they love you, even if they've dropped everything in their lives to help you when you needed it. It doesn't make you owe ANYTHING to them. If they are true family, they will help you no matter the circumstances or the years you have been ignoring them.

"Idk if this is the right subreddit for this and I won’t go into too much detail about the abuse my mother has put me through but it’s both physical and mental though I would say mostly mental.

I have dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past to the point where I even tried to actually kill myself and I’m 18 right now and currently finishing up my exams.

I want to leave this house I genuinely can’t do this anymore I don’t know why I’m getting yelled at and literally pushed onto the floor over forgetting to fold clothes.

She has kicked me out once a few years ago over me not dusting off the shelves which then I ended up apologising and she reluctantly accepted and let me come back.

And those are a few things she has done, I really just don’t know what to do idk where to go or what to do in general idk how to get a job it’s not like they teach that shit in school I can’t even let alone find a place that’s hiring to begin with and even if I do I just need to get out of this house I don’t wanna see my mom, for the past 10 years i was hoping a car would hit her, I feel no love for her I stopped a long time ago I couldn’t care about what happens to her"
"This is my first ever post on here, but I need to vent because I can't tell anyone this because I don't want her to know.
I'm 24, and through circumstances out of my control, I'm still living at home.
My parents have never been the most emotionally supportive or open people while I was growing up, in fact, for the first time this year, they told us about how they want us to open up to them emotionally, but I don't feel comfortable doing so.
Two weeks ago l, my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me out of nowhere, and I've been a mess mentally and emotionally. This has obviously translated to me not being present emotionally, and being absent minded. Luckily I didn't have any classes that week, so I spent the whole week in my room, also trying to study (I'm in university and about to start exams) and I let it get messy. 
She eventually came into my room and started berating me about how messy my room is, and how disgusting I am. Then she called all my relatives to tell them about how ungrateful I am for not being able to do something as simple as keeping my room clean. Then later on, she asked me about why I seem so depressed, and I told her about being broken up with, and she basically told me to move on because he didn't matter  (he's a foreigner).
Then today, she asked me to get some fruit for her, and I got a naartjie, which I would normally peel, but all the trash had been taken out, so I waited till we got outside to peel it. 
I put the naartjie in the car to peel, and she just took it an ld threw it at my head without because it hadn't been peeled yet.
Then she got mad that her car hadn't been cleaned ( she's the only one who uses that car, and she didn't tell us that there are things in the car) 
And then she went on a 30 minute rant about how ungrateful I am and how I can't seem to do anything right, and how my age mates are in their own houses and how she did mule a favour by raising me and buying me nice things
I genuinely think she hates me and resents the fact that I'm still living at home. It's not like I want to, I literally don't have a choice.

"My mum and dad split around a year ago, and even though it was bad before it's getting worse. Over this time it has become apparent to me that it was always our dad taking care of us (me, my sister and my two younger brothers), and never our mum. My grandparents, on my mums side, are urging me to go to a counsellor at school, but I don't know if what she is doing is really that bad. Our youngest brother, 10, has ASD (autism). He is diagnosed, and is nonverbal. Me and my other brother, 12, are likely autistic too, but she has no intention of getting either of us diagnosed. 
What concerns my nan is that she says our mum is neglecting us medically. I told her that one of the last times I had been to a doctor was when I was 11. That was because my mother thought I had gout due to me complaining of pain very often. We went for one appointment, had a blood test, and she had never taken me back, despite getting results that it wasn't gout due to a lack of what causes it in my bloodstream. After a lot of research, I believe I have fibromyalgia, or something simular as I relate to many of its symptoms. My pain has not gotten better, and she has made no moves to help me with this. She will now laugh it off when I complain of pain, even though I'm sure she believes me. It is getting very hard to deal with, which is what made me mention it to my grandparents in the first place. My right ankle will also lock up if I walk for 20mins. What I did not mention is that I have had thoughts of ending it because I don't think I can live like this. But every time my mum laughs it off, I can't help but feel that maybe I'm overreacting? 
We talked more; me, my sister, and my nan, and my sister, who hasnt lived with us for ~6 months, mentioned other things. Since our parents seperated, it has been me, 19(sister) and 12(brother) cleaning the entire house. I will be called downstairs, no matter how much my body ached, to open the door for a cat often. While she is sitting in an armchair on her phone. She (my mum) said because we are younger we can do more. Despite her adopting all four of our cats, she will never feed them. It is always me. I will be called down to clean the kitchen, the lounge, every mess her and 10 make, I am made to clean it. She will say to her friends she only had us to do her work and make her rich, and though everyone takes it as a joke, I don't think it is. My sister moved out because she was doing this work too, and was still expected to 'pay board' to my mother.

She will ignore us if we say anything to her, and if we continue to try she will yell at us. 12 has been yelled at for telling our mother that 10's seatbelt had been unbuckled. I remember my mum threatening to throw a kitchen knife at me if I didn't shut up. She does not remember this, and when i insisted on her saying that to me, she said she probably didn't mean it anyway. I don't know why, but that really sticks with me.

I am expected to look after 10 whenever she needs me too. I likely have ASD, and to be well emotionally I need to prepare myself for it. I have received no notice before; just a text she was going for a coffee and that 10 was home. She says I can say no any time, but I have once since I was sick and she yelled at me for being so selfish. She wanted to take 12 out for a dinner somewhere. 

Even though there is food at home most of the time, she is never there for us emotionally. It doesn't effect me so much; I'm old enough to be independent, but she does not pay frequent attention to 12. I believe this is a reason for his anger issues, he can not talk out his emotions and if he attempts too he will be yelled at. As much as I wish to be, I am not mentally well enough to help him. 

I'm sorry if this is a mess. Im just typing this to try and earn the courage to talk to a counsellor. I have no clue how it works, and I'm scared of it. Does anyone have anything to help with a counselling session? "
"My mother is once again talking about killing herself, killing us, leaving the house ect. And I’m seriously considering running away. She says she loves us, she does nice things, but then when we don’t listen to her for a bit too long she decides it’s okay to leave permanent scars and make us suicidal. Should we run away?"
"I (15F) have been living with my mother 43F) and brother (11M, autistic, will be important later) for about a year. She left my dad about this time last year.

When it came to abuse my dad was normally the bad one before they split up, but over time my mother just got worse and worse.
When i knew it really got bad was when she hit me across the face for having a panic attack.

She’s proceeded to belittle, mock, threaten, purposefully upset me and hurt me since then, more than ever before.
For example, this morning, my mother came into my room to try and force me to shower. I have no issues with showering but have severe sensory issues and find it uncomfortable to shower. I had been having a particularly bad time mentally and was already experiencing severe sensory issues. She yelled at me and threatened to restrict my phone access for the day if i didn’t, then physically forced me to move forward.
I was crying, and she hates hearing me cry, so then threatened to record me having a meltdown. i don’t know what to do.

I’ve wanted to cut her off when i move out for a long time now, but i genuinely feel bad as she’s my mother.
AITA?"

"My dad used to hate me so much and would hit me and get into my face almost every day and now that I am taking about moving out and cutting him out of my life, now he is saying that he thinks that I will turn out the best compared to my siblings and tells me that I can't trust any of them and also tells me that I can't even trust my friends enough to move in with anyone.

"The answer might be obvious to some of yall but hear me out. I, (17 Female) have had a rough childhood. Always abused and screamed at. I am convinced my mom actually hates me. a few years back, when I was 6 or 7, my step dad beat me with his belt. Multiple hits as I cried in the corner of my walls. Through the whole thing, I only yelled for my mom to help me. I knew she was nearby. My yells should have definitely reached her. After he stopped and walked away while cussing at me. I cried for 30 minutes and then went to go find her to see why she didn’t come. I couldn’t believe what I saw. She was on the couch the whole time SMILING and LAUGHING while talking to her friend. I asked her why she didn’t help me. She acted confused as if it was meant to happen to me. She then said I deserved it for being bad and to go away. I stood there with my puffy red eyes. tears dripping down and that’s when it hit me. I now knew she definitely would trade me for anything that day. As years passed by things turned worse. One thing good happened though. I got stronger from all the abuse and fought back. one thing I can’t handle is her screams. She hurts me. we fought a lot throughout the years, she always guilt trip me and acted like a victim when my step Dad gets involved. Even when she started or hurt me more, she would always say I hurt her more. One time she even drew blood on my skin with her own nails. Then laughed it off and walked away. I pretty much hate her every move. When she breathes, when she laughes, when she walks, etc. A Lot worse happened. But today I’ve had enough. My friend came over unexpected and I was so happy. We hung out and she excused herself to the restroom. the amount of shame I felt when she told me what happened in indescribable. She said she saw bloody undies On the ground. I looked at it and gagged. No one should be ashamed to have their period but this was just disgusting and shameless. I told my friend to kindly leave and that I need to speak to my mother. when I came in my moms rooms, she started yelling at me. she said “WHY WOULD YOU LET HER SEE” or “THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT”. I was so confused and asked her what she’s talking about. She said I let my friend see her Underwear and kept blaming me. I’ve had enough and told her  that  she’s unhygienic and disgusting. It sucks living with her and having to shower everyday because just the thought of her makes me feel the need to shower. I said more but I don’t wanna get into it. My step dad came home and yelled at me. Wouldn’t get out of my room. He kept getting close to me but I didn’t want to get harmed so I just told me to please get out while crying. and guess what? He still wouldn’t. I pushed him out and shut my door fast as he pounded on it. I cried out for him to go away. After an hour of my arms being sore from holding my door so that he couldn’t come in I just cried while sitting on the floor. I heard my mom laughing and telling him that he put up a great fight. I am sad. Miserable even. I have one job that doesn’t pay well along with school to pay attention to. I’m trying to graduate early and I’m almost 18 in a few months. why am I trying to graduate early you ask? Well I have this friend in another state whos dad is a college professor. He said he can get me Into my dream college fast if I come to his state. i believe him because he did it before except I had to turn it down because I had other plans in the past that didn’t involve going to college. But now i know that college is my only freedom, escape, and future. I have 896 dollars saved up So far. I need enough to buy a flight and then rent an apartment. I hate to ask anyone for help but my cashapp is $Iambm9 and every cent helps. If anyone wants updates let me know."
"I've been feeling not so great in the past couple days because of my periods, and I was making dinner with mom.

But, because the speaker from the oven is broken, it doesn't make a noise besides a short tick, so I can't hear it if I'm not in the kitchen close by.

And I was not feeling great and wanted to sit for a bit waiting for the food to cook, but I got distracted and forgot what time it was. And, I didn't hear the sound from the oven, so I eneded up burning the dinner for whole family.

And when my dad smelled the burning, he got so mad and yelled at me to go stand in my corner, and I was so tired and not feeling great, so I asked him I'm really sorry but if I can maybe push the punishment to later, but he didn't want to hear me. He was like ""No way. Go stand now, nose in the corner, and skirt up. Do I need to start counting?""

I asked him again if he can go easy on me because of the period, and because it's more embarrassing, and my mom hopped in and said ""Oh honey, it's not your fault you are on your periods. Don't be embarrassed. You should have been more careful especially we all already know that you get too hot in the head during your time of the month.""

Then she also told me to listen to my dad because I already know the consequences and didn't pay attention.

And I had to stand in the corner like that while my dad, my little brother, and mom ate dinner looking at me and making fun of me.... 

I'm sorry for venting but I don't know how to feel even a little bit better besides venting a bit.."
"hi guys, i just found this subreddit. i just had another fight with my mom and feel like i need some advice so i’ll share a bit of my story.
so growing up, my mom has always been really angry and quick to set off. she yelled and screamed a lot, stomped, slammed doors, the whole thing. she often times hit me, shoved me etc., the only thing she never did was hit me with a closed fist. i have a little sister who is only 3 years younger than me and i have always felt like my parents treated her a lot better than me. they gave her pretty much everything she wanted even if it was at my expense. they constantly took/take her side in arguments and let her get away with a lot more than i ever did. so i’ll get to what todays argument was about.
i am a full time college student and my parents are helping me out with college. i told them when i started college that when i had my car on campus i would be getting a job so that i could pay them back. i just got home for summer break and have not had the chance to look for a job yet because i wanted a week to relax without having to think of school or work. my mom this entire past week has been making snide comments about how i “still haven’t found a job” and basically been making me feel bad for wanting some time to relax, and claiming that everyone else had already found jobs. so me and my sister got in an argument and my mom thought it was best to t to address it, so she asked for my sisters side, and then she asked for mine, where i told her what happened and then she said “but is that really what happened? i know you” trying to imply that i am a liar. so i obviously got mad, and she asked “well what should we do to resolve this situation?” and i mistakenly mentioned that i was thinking about moving in with my boyfriend for the summer. this sent her into a spiral, where she told me that she was going to unsign her part in my lease for next year. she also brought up how i was apparently crazy because i threatened to call the police on her one time. then she claimed “well obviously i am just a horrible, abusive mother” which i have never said. she claims that i constantly being up what she used to do to me when i was little, and claims that none of it is true. so then i tried to fake apologize just so that we could have some normalcy, but then she told me that i have apparently been “breaking her down my entire life” and have always told her that she was “horrible parent” and always compared her to other people’s parents, when growing up she was the one who used to compare me to other people’s kids. she claimed that she was done with me “breaking her down,” and that i was apparently th abusive one. now i am left questioning if that’s really true or not, or if i’m being gaslit. i feel like i’m telling myself i’m being gaslit even though i’m not so i can not take the blame for it , but that’s something my mom tells me so i am just really not sure if any of it is real. i mean, there’s no chance i could just come out of the womb and start manipulating everyone around me, right? there has to be a reason why i ended up like this. i feel like it’s all my fault. so am i being gaslit?

"I don't know whether I should write these things down or not. I feel very hopeless and depressed. My life seems so bleak, and nothing I can do will change that. I just want to be free—free of pain, free of stress, and free of abuse. Everything that I have gone through must have meaning, because if it doesn't, then I might just end it all.

I don't know why she acts this way. I did not force her to give birth to me. She was the one who decided it. Even my own father was against me being born, not because he didn't want me, but because he knew how messed up she was. He wanted to leave, but couldn't because of me. Poor him. I pity my father so much. If I wasn't born, maybe he could have left this abusive relationship. He could have been free. But I am a selfish person, and to be honest, I am glad that he didn't leave, because if he had left, I would have probably been sold off to someone to get married. Even now, she threatens me with it, saying that she could make someone kidnap me and force me to become their wife. I'm only 18, by the way, so imagine that happening. It isn't that uncommon in my culture; in fact, most of my sisters got married that way and they never left because of honor. But they thought that this was the only way to escape the monster—from one abusive household to another. My poor sisters. I also pity them. My father is their stepfather, and although he wanted to be involved in their lives, she never let that happen. Guess why. Because she was jealous of her own children. One of my sisters even ran away from home and got married to someone much older than her because she couldn't take it anymore. Her whole life got ruined because of it. And now she does the same thing to me. She accuses me of sleeping with my own father. Since I became a teenager, my virginity has always been in question. I don't even do anything for her to suspect something like that. She even says herself that none of my peers would sleep with me, so I probably try to do it with my own blood-related father. It's sickening. I don't even want to talk about physical abuse; that's just my daily routine now. I remember being beaten with a wooden stick for 10 minutes straight because I didn't wait for her to pick me up from school. I was nine or ten. I didn't know any better. And our house is 20 minutes away, walking distance. One time, she made me bleed from my head and I had to calm her down and apologize for ""making her hurt me."" I don't know what to do anymore. My arms are full of scars, and I am ashamed of showing them. When my friends ask, I say they are gifts from my mother. Today she threw me out of the house. If it wasn't for my dad, I would have become homeless. I am just so tired. I want to end it all.

"I just need to vent and don't know who to vent to so sorry for the super long, dramatic post. I guess I'm sharing my ""story"" in case it makes someone feel less alone, because I'm hoping to feel that way. I guess I'm also hoping for advice.  :)

  
Growing up, my father was physically/ emotionally/ verbally abusive. The physical stuff was only when I was very young, it fizzled out as I grew up. But the other stuff was so brutal. The general overview was that I was the scapegoat from a very early age. My older brother had some special needs/ emotional issues so a lot of my parents' energy went to him and my younger sister was the baby of the family, the favorite, often leaving me on the outskirts. Any attention I did get was purely negative. I think as a child I harbored some resentment towards the two of them, as unfair as it is. I know as an adult it wasn't their fault and I truly feel I've moved past it. However the effects of only ever experiencing negative attention from my parents are horrible.

I was taught at such a young age that I was bad, that there was something truly, devastatingly wrong with me, and therefore I caused all of the tension and fighting in the house. My father had a hard day at work, it was my fault when he took it out on everyone. My siblings got in a fight, it was my fault for causing the bad moods. If I retaliated while being attacked (physically or verbally), it was viewed as an isolated incident, an uncalled for, uncontrollable temper. When I did mess up or misstep, it only made it worse. Everyone else was infallible, while my mistakes were ammunition, weaponized as evidence. 

I remember knowing something was wrong but not having the language for it. I was too young to understand and by the time I got older and had the capacity to communicate what was happening to me, the manipulation ran so deep that I didn’t think words like “abuse” applied to my situation. I so deeply believed that I was bad and terrible and every other horrible thing they called me that I thought it was my fault. The physical stuff had subsided, so isn’t it my fault that they yell? 

I figured out how to keep myself safe eventually. Stay out of the way. Stay in your room. Don’t make noise. Don’t cross their paths. Don’t have any wants or needs. If you overhear slamming or yelling, hold your breath, make yourself smaller, pray it subsides before they remember you’re there. It didn’t always work, but I did my best. The only way I got through was counting down the years until I finished high school and I could get out. Though sometimes that number provided more dismay than comfort. 

It wasn’t until I graduated high school that I realized what it was. My parents split up at the end of my senior year and it was the first time I heard someone else use the word. My mother. I remember when the word “abuse” passed her lips. Some part of me found it to be obvious, another part of me was destroyed. Nothing was the same after that. I had already experienced such a tumultuous upbringing and now I had to re-experience it under the lens of abuse. It was like it happened twice. 

The first year was really strange. My father was overly nice, overly welcoming, trying to forge a connection we’d never had. My mother was apologetic, trying to rebuild something that never was. My father was afraid I’d testify and my mother… I suppose she felt guilty for never stepping in. I don’t know what I felt. Confused. Angry. Hurt. I knew my parents had been strict and unkind, but downright abusive? It made sense but I didn’t want it to. 

My anxiety was really bad. With my father out of the house, all of my repressed memories started coming back to me. I was having nightmares every night. I started having panic attacks. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. Every minute awake was spent in an anxiety attack (with the occasional panic attack) and every minute asleep was filled with nightmares. This went on for about two months. I lost about 30 pounds. 

This was also during quarantine, so my family was stuck at home together. My mother and I didn’t have the kind of relationship where we could talk to one another so she assumed I was completely fine. My siblings were always welcome to come to her so she knew they were having a hard time with it, so her attention and compassion went to them. When I started having panic attacks, I talked to her, hoping for some kind of help or support. Instead I was brushed off. 

Summer/ fall of that year was when things started to deteriorate once more. My mother was angry and I was the recipient. Every word that left her mouth about me was negative, whether it was to me or to someone else. My mere presence and existence were enough to set her off. Just like as a child, it was all on me. Everyone’s anger, everyone’s moods, all of the fighting and yelling. It was all on me again. But I was angry too. I had just realized my father had abused me my entire life and that my mother had stood by while it happened. Not only that, but she was a participant my whole childhood. I know it’s not fair to blame her. If my father was like that with my siblings and I, I can only imagine what else was going on. But I was a child. She was an adult. As a woman, I have so much empathy for her. As her child, I didn’t know how to forgive her, especially when she was continuing the cycle even after my dad left. 

The year I was 19 was filled with constant anger and flights, I always had to be on guard, ready for anything. Her threatening to kick me out was nothing new, but now that I was old enough to be on my own, it felt so much more real. It also felt so unjustified. I’d yell back when I was being yelled at. I was bad about keeping up with my chores. But there wasn’t a single instance that felt worthy of throwing me aside. Yet she held shelter and stability over my head every chance she got. I was attending community college classes and working part time, saving up as much as I could in case she followed through. 

We lost our house that year, moved to an apartment. Tensions only grew worse. My mom was more stressed out than ever and I was more of a target than ever. I worked two jobs, attended classes. I was never home, never asked for anything, paid for all of my own things, never engaged with her. And yet…

I was 21 when it finally happened, after years of being threatened with it. I was a semester away from finishing my degree, still working two jobs, still staying out of the way. My older brother and I were told my mother and sister were moving at the end of the week and we were not welcome to join. The lease on our current apartment ended in two months and we were welcome to stay if we covered the bills, but after that, we were on our own. No help.

My brother was 24, two years into a full time job, tens of thousands of dollars saved away. While still obviously a horrible situation, he’d be okay. But me? I know 21 is an adult but I was still in school. Yes I worked two jobs but they were still part time, and almost all of my income was spent on school, gas, groceries, and bills. At this point, I was a few months into no contact with my father. When my mother told me this, we didn’t speak for months. We eventually got back in touch, but it's not a proper connection. 

The hardest part was that I was alone. There was no family I could stay with, no friends able to take me in, no one to help me find a place or help me understand my finances and my options. The tuition for my last semester of school was $5,000. I would be student teaching in the mornings and working all afternoon and weekends. I’d have to make enough money to fully cover all of my bills and necessities while spending 20 hours a week student teaching, completely unpaid, on top of all of my other classes. I didn’t have much in savings since I had to spend most of my income to get by, which meant I couldn’t afford a security deposit or movers or furniture or first/ last month's rent. I lived in an expensive area where even a studio was $2,000/ month minimum, and that’s before utilities and everything else. I didn’t see how I could make it work. I didn't know anyone I could room with and moving with strangers was a last resort. I spent those two months trying to figure it out, trying to accept the very real, tangible possibility of homelessness. 

Eventually, I found a place. My grandparents help me with part of my rent. I work three jobs. I had to drop out of school. I’m not in touch with my parents. I’m 22 now. Being on my own, I feel a bit better. Not having to live in constant fight or flight, not having basic necessities held over your head, not being hated and terrorized just for existing… It's so peaceful. I’m stressed about money and my future, but it feels so much more approachable now. I hate my circumstances but for the first time in my life, I have a will to keep going. 

That being said, it’s also so difficult. Seeing people my age close to their families, having a home and people to go back to, getting to graduate college supported by loved ones (financially or otherwise), only just now starting their adult lives… It's hard. A better person would be happy for them, and deep down I am, but I’m also so jealous. I don’t know if I’ll ever get to finish my degree. I don’t want to take out loans with no way to pay them back. Yes I’m working three jobs, but the cost of living is so immense, just about every cent goes to bills, rent, and necessities. I don’t see a way out but I want to find one. I don’t want my parents to get to rob me of my dreams in life when they’ve already taken so much from me. I’ll never be the person I could’ve been if I grew up with love and support, but I don’t want that to stop me. 

I know this is an impossibly long post. I just needed to vent and get things off of my chest. But if anyone reading this has any advice, I’d love to hear it. I know 22 is an adult, I know I should be more put together than this, people are in my situation so much younger and they figure it out, but I just feel so lost. I want to finish school. I don’t want to barely get by while working 3 jobs. I want a family. I don’t know what to do.

"My grandmother (60) has just accused me of being insane. This is because i broke down crying due to my father locking my phone, (my phone has parental controls even though i bought the phone.)

 
 The thing is, i was removed from my parents house yesterday, due to my mother being physically abusive and my father being sexually abusive. My grandmother has told me that my parents are good parents and love me, and that I can’t go to the court against them as it says in the 10 commandments to respect your parents (shes an extreme catholic and im agnostic due to past traumas within the church.) I tried to explain to my grandmother that my father is locking my phone as a punishment for me telling social Workers what had happened, as this is something he has done before, and that it his way of showing he has control over me.


My grandmother is now taking me to church to repent for my sins. I started crying due to the stuff my father has done and this was a full on panic attack where i was hyperventilating, and she started shouting that I didnt have a reason to cry and its all in the past. She has threatened to remove me from my school (which i had to pass an exam for as it’s one of the best schools in my country) and to put it me in the really bad school close to her.


I feel insane and i feel like im a horrible person because i know this is a lot for her to handle, but it feels like she is blaming me for everything and not parents for anything.

It has been awhile since we last spoke and I am reaching out because as the parent I should have not given up when you didn’t continue to reach out .

I hope we can make amends as to what the root of the issue is and fix it and move on with live and sincerity but if you choose not to then at least tell me why … I love you”"
"I (15f) have insomnia. It gets so bad at nights that I'd just lay in my bed, overthinking things. That usually leaves me to question lots of things, and I end up spiraling and crying.

My mother, (39f) and father (43m) have bought me medication for this. I stopped using it a while ago, due to it not working. I asked for a higher dosage, but my parents refused, saying that: ""If the house began to burn down, I wouldn't wake up intime to run"".

One night after a full day of Netball, from 8AM - 7PM, I had around two hours sleep (Note: I'm not allowed coffee or any caffeine to wake up, I'm expected to be able to jump out of bed with a lot of energy). I woke up the next morning to my father yelling at me to get up. I had dark eyebags and bloodshot eyes. I looked like the walking dead. This was on Sunday as well, so I really wanted to try and sleep a bit more.

Sundays are the days that my grandparents sometimes come over to take us to the early morning mass. My grandparents are religious, even pestering my parents to send me and my other siblings to Catholic schools, even though my parents aren't religious.

Anyway, I basically wasn't feeling okay, and I told my father this, but he ignored me, saying that I should do it ""for my grandparents"" since ""they don't have long to live, and we should make them happy while we can"". I understand this, but my mental health had already been declining with the pile of schoolwork and my friends fighting and having bad home lives.

I finally got up from my bed, and while my siblings were all dressed and ready to go, I was on the verge of tears. I kept telling him that I didn't want to go, that I was too tired, and he kept saying he didn't care. I got dressed anyway, and while I was looking for socks, he kept saying things like: ""You had all morning to get dressed"", and ""I already yelled at you to wake up and get dressed, this is your own fault"".

I was already really sick of it, and I kept talking back. Eventually, my father got fed up with this, and got as physically close as possible before yelling at me. I was terrified. It's not a nice experience to see your father right up in your face, teeth bared like a feral animal and yelling at me that this is his house and I have to listen to him while I lived there. He didn't physically hurt me, but I was scared he would.

I snapped at this and shoved him away. I told him to ""Get the fck away from me"", before staggering into my grandparents car, sobbing. My father looked as if he was going to hurt me, but my mother stopped him, saying I was only a child. I spent the rest of Mass trying not to cry, dreading when I got back.

When I did, my parents both came to the decision that I was disrespectful, and was setting a bad example for my younger siblings, who might copy what I did. My punishment? Sleeping in the laundry until my parents said, and six months doing everyone's chores (We live in a household where there are seven people, not including any visitors, and two dogs), and that I was grounded until they decided to.

Every night before I go to sleep, I have to clean the dirty laundry, which stores bags, shoes, and dirty clothes, after all the chores I had to do, and set up a bed there that I have to pack up every day when I wake up."
"im so scared of my mom that when she got in the shower i sighed in relief and was like ""good, im safe now for 10 minutes"" like wtf how do you fail that bad as a parent "
"hello, I am 18 and planning on cutting of my abusive family very soon. It has been an ongoing plan for about 4 years, but they found out about it about a year ago and most of my plans fell through. Things have come to a head here and I need to leave for my own safety and well-being. to say Im terrified is an understatement, and I am not sure what to do. I have cash saved up, as well as a job where I am putting some of my paycheck into a secret account. I also have a place to stay when I leave where I would be treated like one of their kids, but theyre not rich and I would feel terrible mooching off of their money when i stay there.

MY question is: what are the big adult things? My car, phone bill, and credit card are all under my parents name. I assumed wouldnt be able to bring my credit cards or car, but wjat about my phone? An my car, to get to work everyday? I also do not have access to my passport or social security card, I just have photos of it. I need to work out the logistics of everything before I leave.

TLDR: super financially dependent on my family, but needs to leave yesterday. What big scary adult things do I need to essentially start a new life?"
"normally, my mom is a nice person to me. but sometimes she gets really mad. just now, i was telling her i was too tired to go on a walk to a park, but she was yelling at me a lot telling me to go, and i just snapped (i've never been able to control my emotions well) so i yelled back and she slapped my arm. she also told me that we're not going on a trip again.  
other times i've been thinking about her possibly being abusive are every time she threatened to leave the house and not come back when i was way younger, and how often she threatens to send me to a mainstream school (i'm autistic and i go to an autism special school)  
it's conflicting, because she's usually lovely to me. it's just sometimes she goes too far. is she abusive, or am i overthinking it? my arm hurts, but she rarely hits me, so i'm not sure. the things she says can feel like guilt tripping, but i'm not sure at all. can someone help?"
"I hate when my parents make me stand in the corner. It makes me feel so small, and it makes me feel like a child, and it is embarrassing. 

But, whenever I slightly mess up, my dad's first response is ""Go stand in your corner. And show me how silly you are.""

So, I waited until he was in a good mood, and I walked up to him and asked ""could you maybe consider not sending me into the corner since I'm growing up? Maybe I could learn the same being sent to my room.""

Then he was like ""do you think you know better than me?"" And, I knew I messed up.

He then right away said ""Go stand in your corner and show me how silly you are."" Then I had to go there with my nose in the corner and my dress up and everything.

Then he was like ""if you are so smart and better than me, why are you standing here like a silly girl?""

Then he called for my mom and asked if I'm on my period because I'm acting irrational. Then he made me stand there for so long and I felt so little and mortified again..

Later mom came and told me ""maybe you should act better, then you wouldn't have to go to the corner. Don't talk like that to your father.""

It feels so humiliating, but I can't help myself."
"

Me (19f) have been scared of my dad since i was 8. Everytime i would do something wrong he would strip me completely naked and spank me with a belt. 
Now that im older he took the door for my room and my closet, the worst one was he tought me and my sister (15y) had been involved with a guy so he made has stand completely naked in front of a big part of our family until we admitted something we didn't do."
"I have tried to understand dynamics. If the role of the person who constantly goes up and down in moods between rejection and demanding attention, the person who can’t control their anger, who is frustrated by people expressing their own actual wants and needs if it isn’t what they want, selfish and controlling, who manipulates people with threats of suicide, calls everyone names, has been violent, will destroy your things etc. is the victim and the scapegoat then absolutely fuck that and I do not agree. 

There’s a difference between being so intensely selfish that you make everything about yourself and claim you’re actually a supreme victim vs being the scapegoat. This person thinks everyone is abusing them when no one is, and when they don’t get their way. They couldn’t give a shit about their parents, or siblings as people or as people with equally valid needs. 

They put themselves in dangerous positions so they are pursued because to them that’s love. All the while verbally abusive.

They aren’t hated by the family, not at all. Everyone is obsessed with trying to understand why they aren’t ok, why is everything we do causing this person pain? 

We leave them alone after they want space , they say that’s demented abuse, we try and talk and call and check up, they block you, asked to be left alone, try to be close and you move wrong and they’ll say how you’re a bad person and always have been sick. 

I hate this internet idea that the scapegoat is so nice and just got blamed for things. What about it the black sheep is completely erratic and abusive, unable to hold stable relationships with anyone, never had a long term relationship, and can’t even keep a job?

Then if anyone else has needs or is depressed they invalidate them completely! Whether parents or siblings. They call everyone with needs or boundaries selfish or abusive. 



Tell me what this is. Not an abused scapegoat, and abuser. 2nd child who gets attention and their way through threats and lashing out. 

I have not called the person one bad name, but if I do something innocuous that they don’t like they will send me a 1500 page text about how I’m a I’m and deserve everything bad that can happen to me, and also they won’t speak to me for a year. Tell me how that’s the poor victim of the family, the scapegoat. Everyone suffers in abusive families full stop. "
"Hey,

So I just want some unbiased feedback from people regarding if my cousins were abused growing up. They both would insist they weren't, but the older one (27F same age as me) is currently in rehab for alcohol abuse after her 3rd DUI after moving across the country to California by herself. She's made a LOT of bad decisions over the years but she used to be my best friend when we were younger... I know she's suffered from ana/bul for a long time and had a miscarriage when we were 13. She has openly had issues with her dad (my uncle) since we were teens, but has verbalized for the last few years on and off that ""nobody cares about her"" and ""her family treats her like shit""...

My younger cousin (24M) I currently live with and love to absolute pieces but he's also been through a lot. His parents kicked him out during covid at the age of 20 with no job because they were moving almost 2 hours away and wanted to live child free. I've expressed many a time how shocking this was to my cousin when he told me about it and it severely changed my overall outlook on my aunt and uncle. He couch surfed for years off and on until I was able to get him a job working with me and he was able to move in with me and my best friend. We've lived together for over a year now and things were overall happy but recently he's been dealing with a lot again. My best friend and my cousin are both queer and a messed up situation occurred on the Grindr app between the two of them, but long story short my best friend ended up coordinating a voyeur event involving my cousin.

This has caused shock waves throughout the house obviously and my cousin has every right to be extremely upset. After a lot of confusion, some things were cleared up from the extra person that was involved with this and it was proven that my best friend did not touch my cousin. This does NOT change the fact that the entire situation was effed up and orchestrated, but I do believe with intense therapy for both of them that something can be worked out...

However, I also do not believe that with all of the stuff going on with my cousin that he had any right to lash out at me in the car for explaining how I feel like our coworkers are harassing me at work. For context, my cousin is into edgelord dumb alt right style comedy and likes to make transphobic, homophobic, racist, etc jokes at work sometimes. The trade field I am in is almost all men, and I am one of two women in our whole shop. There were more before, but after the last one quit for a different job, all these jokes have just gotten SO much worse. I constantly feel like I am getting egged on for my reaction, one example was last week i was told I should ""get stung by a bee for the experience"" after talking about how my grandma was deathly allergic. This kind of things been happening almost weekly since January and I vented to my cousin in the car ride home (I give him car rides almost every work day) and he just absolutely blew up on me.

He screamed about how I need to ""Get the eff over it"", how he has to tell me like it is because when I get upset it ruins the whole vibe for him and he just wants to have fun at work. I told him that edgy jokes are fun when theyre NOT pointed directly at someone and he just wouldnt put himself into my shoes and continually told me to get thicker skin. There was a lot more that was said but long story short, he basically cannot accept that he could be wrong in this situation and even if it was all jokes, if it hurts someone its not worth making them.

I know that's how he was raised, his dad specifically gives no effs about equality, ""woke culture"", etc and they've always been VERY well off their whole lives so my cousins feel that anybody who has trauma or gets upset about ""little things"" need to suck it up because that's what their parents told them. My uncle still calls depression ""the dark place"" I do know that he's currently in therapy but I fear that the damage to his kids is too far gone. My dad (my uncle's brother) died in 2010, and my mom is a single mom whos been working at a grocery store for 41 years but can still find time to love and empathize with her child. She was also very upset to hear that my cousin was kicked out during covid and she bought him a queen size mattress to sleep on while he stayed at her house with my sister for a few months before moving in with me.

I just want to know the best way to move forward with my cousins. The older one in California I fear is a lost cause, she's been told to move back home so many times and she just wont... The cousin that I live with didn't come home last night after our blow up because I texted him setting my boundaries going forward (not allowed to use my coffee and no more rides to work) and texted back shooting off things to hit below the belt (like my weight, how I am ""rotting"" because I dont go out and see friends every night like he does, etc.) I want to be there for him because of all the things he is going through but I also need to protect my peace.

Thoughts?"
"Serious question. I feel like this void will never go away or be filled because of having absolutely no love or support from either parents. Ontop of that, growing up in a loveless, abusive household caused me to have trust issues, depression, anxiety, PTSD, lack of confidence and constantly putting myself down.

How does one cope with all of this? Does it ever go away? "
"I’m 16 and for almost my entire life my mom has been very verbally and emotionally abusive. When I was little she would frequently blame me for things I never did, calling me Insults and making me feel Iike trash. I developed severe PTSD from this and it’s safe to say my brain is permanently altered by the abuse.

My mom now is in therapy trying to get over it. She blames everything that happened to me on her depression, downgrading it, saying it wasn’t a big deal, that I’m being dramatic, that a little yelling wouldn’t scar me… is that really true?

I want to love my mom, I do! I don’t want to be rebellious or bad and say that  I I don’t love her, because I really really want to. And she’s trying her best to recover… even if she’s failing. 

She says that I can’t hate her, that I’m obligated to love her because she went through abuse too… but I just don’t know. I don’t want to be a bad kid, I just want to know I’m not being bad by saying I don’t love her.. "
"I moved back into my moms place a few months ago. I thought she’d changed, she’d been helpful and seemingly nice while I was living out of state. I felt like I’d been the issue all along, and that moving back in was best for me. I found out over these past 3 months that it truly feels like she likes to fight me on everything. I try to not talk to her and still it’s always ending in her screaming at me. She put her hands on me and excuses it, still. Honestly, I feel more worried for my cat here. She has cancer and IBD so I’m trying not to stress her out. I find her huddled up, scared.  Now I’m between going back to the city that gave me financial issues and turned me here or a city I don’t really know as well but my partner would be an hour away. The previous city has a better job and I know the vet specialist and all. The other is more unknown but still I’m closer to my partner. I just don’t know what’s right now. I thought this was. Even the vet here has been terrible. Jobs unreliable. "
"hello if anyone sees this my partner is living in a really abusive household, both mentally and physically abusive. He’s 21 and doesn’t make enough money to leave but he’s actively trying to find a new job. I love with my family so he can’t live with me. Does anyone know if there is anything that can help him get out? Is there any government assistance that can be used? I’d really appreciate any help. "
"About 3 years ago I went to counseling for the physical and mental abuse I went through growing up until I was 18. I “graduated” counseling after about a year and the nightmares went away, the triggers happened less and less and I finally realized I deserved all the good things that were happening to me. Last October I found out I was pregnant with a little girl. I was never supposed to be able to get pregnant so she’s an absolute miracle. Unfortunately all the work we did in counseling went down the drain. Instead of being sad, I am angry. I’m holding my belly and already wondering how someone could do the things my mother put me through. I get excited thinking about having a mini me with brown curly hair and then think about how my mother would call me ugly even though everyone told me I looked like her. I get to love her the way I wish I was and thats healing in itself BUT ever since I got pregnant, my mother is now insisting on being in my life. She’s cringely hugged me twice now in one year and I think that’s more than she has in my entire life! The thought of her even holding my daughter makes me want to die. What kind of mother would I be to even allow that? I don’t know what to do. What’s the appropriate way to tell her I don’t want her near my child? She’s already badgering me about making sure I tell her when I go into labor… "
"Okay so, I don't even know where to start. This is going to be a pretty long one but please help me out. I (16F) lost my dad when I was 14 due to lung cancer. My father was an amazing dad and he was my best friend (he basically knew everything about me). Some context about my mother, I knew I wasn't her favorite out of my 2 other siblings (14F) (19M) early on in life. She's always favoured my brother over me and my sister because hes a guy and favoured my sister over me because she's the younger one (?). She made me babysit both my maternal uncles children (now 11M, 12M, 9M) and do all the household work when I was around 12, too. My father was out of state during those times. She could very well afford more than 2 maids during that time too but she just didn't. I broke my leg around the same time but she didn't take me to the doc until I called my dad crying out of pain and he sent his employee to take me to his clinic. He flew back the next day and they had a really bad fight, I've a very vivid memory of all of this but i remember my dad telling her that I'm not a toy she can keep however she wants. Actually, her behavior wasn't as evident before as I had my dad to make it up. I hope that gives you all some idea about it. 


My mother has been emotionally abusing me since dad passed away but the physical abuse started around a week and some days ago. I had my exam the next day. It was well past 12am and I was on a conference with my friends discussing about that exam only (she does not want me having friends). There was one of my guy friend on the line too. I was in the living room when I told everyone i better head to bed. As soon as I opened the door I saw her standing at the door frame in her nightsuit. She asked me who I was talking to, I said my friends. She said no you were also talking to a guy, I replied yes, it was a conference. She started beating her head with her hands and asked me why I would do this to her. It was like she was having a psychotic episode.


 I tried to calm her down but she went inside the kitchen (the living room is attached to the kitchen) and brought a knife. She tried to hold my wrist and slit it as I was trying to push her away as gently as I could in that moment of panic so I wouldn't end up hurting her. I held her hand which had the knife with mine and she started pinching it with her other. The pinches were so bad they left bruises. When that wasn't working she took the knife to my chest as an attempt to reach my throat. But ended up giving me a very bad cut around my ribs (i was only wearing a very thin undershirt). She didn't stop even when it started bleeding. When I saw the blood and finally pushed her away with all of my force she hit the wall and stared crying while holding her knees. I tried to calm her down yet again but she pushed me away and went upstairs. I went to clean up the blood and when I came back my phone wasn't there. She did give me my phone back a week later. She even banned me from going to school or my tuitions.


Now since that day she gets frustrated so easily and hits me any chance she gets. She hit me with a belt because I didn't clean up the cupboard (my sister messed it up and I had just come back from my tuitions of 4 hours). She tried to choke me because I told her I'd do the dishes after I completed studying for my tests. So it's pretty bad. I did tell my brother but he instead asked my mother if she did that (he saw the bruises and a picture of the cut too). And as you may guess my mother hit me for telling him too. I would report her but she's a good mother to both of my siblings and I don't want my sister to lose both of her parents. Yes im sure she doesn't abuse my sister or brother in any way. 


My friend who lives on the other side of the country offered to buy me tickets and I could fly to him. But honestly that would just make it all worse. My father was a well known investor and has a lot of property. And it is A LOT. I cant inherit any of it until I'm 18 obviously. He had a college fund for me too but I can't access it until I'm 18 either. (Legally I've turned 15 this year, yeah they changed my birth year for some school admission thing. So I'll be inheriting any of it 3 years later only). I have plans to study on the other side of the country and I need her to fund me. I think she's just looking for reasons to make me stay here and torture me. How do I collect the money to go study? Where I live teenagers don't really do part time, specially not girls. 


It's all too tiring honestly and I can't deal with all of this anymore. Help me out with anything atp. Please. "
"[i am posting this in place for my friend, the following words are all her own]


I (17) am planning to move out of my parents abusive household in a couple months on my 18th birthday. I have a savings account under my name, but it is connected to my father’s bank account. I do not have access to my bank card, and all forms of identification have been stripped from me. I am afraid that if I tell my father or mother that I am moving out ahead of time, they will transfer all of my savings into my dads account so I do not have access to the money. Is there anyway I could safely obtain the money out of my savings account as soon as I turn 18? As of now, I cannot physically visit the bank prior to turning 18. I am so not think I would be able to talk with the bank without it notifying my father, and I cannot call due to the fact that I secretly have a phone. "
"Look. I'm no misogynist. I believe in equality in all things in life. Be it gender, race, religion, sexual preference, etc. 

But I've been on the receiving end of a lot of abuse from women in my life. My mom, my sister, an ex girlfriend. And consciously. I'm fully aware that 3 people don't represent a whole gender and it's not cool to hold it against them. But then I get on social media and see some of the things women on there say. And all and all it's quite soul-crushing. 

I dont wanna be that type of guy and above that I don't even think it's fair. But I can't help but to Harbour some negative feelings toward women. I try to remember that a lot of men have treated me pretty poorly as well, and in general do far worse stuff. But the psychological torment I've gotten from those 3 women effects me in ways I really wish it didn't. "
"So hello everyone. I chose to join this community because I really need people to reach out with 😭 

sorry if thus makes no sense logically in the way I write, I’m kinda burnt out and just had to write a really stressful essay so my brain is completelyfried ☠️

tw: physical and mental abuse, SH, possible SA

since I was about 6-7, I moved into a new home. My mom sort of restarted herself, joining social medias and such, reaching out to friends. My dad just… is my dad. The stereotypical homophobic guy you read about. iykyk.   
since then, my mom has basically believed everything she sees. At around 7 1/2, she established a 30 minute screen time rule. If I broke it, i’d be grounded for 2 weeks. Sometimes I’d sneak into their room and use it, but was often caught.   
i grew up in a family where talking about things I liked would criminalize me. So I didn’t. I learned To not talk, to not feel in front of them. To be a perfect little kid. I grew Up hiding pretty much everything I didn’t want them to see.   
the pretty basic ‘you can talk to me’, etc was constantly on me- lovebombing, then yelling, etc etc. 

so far I have a couple undiagnosed mental issues my parents both refuse To akoknowlege- autism, adhd. I can TELL on everything I have some form of OCD. The only medical condition that is confirmed it Motor Tick. It’s annoying as hell. I’ll get into that later. 

according to my mom, and my dad but specifically my mom, I am ‘too young’ to know if I should be evaluated for any of the things I’ve preciously listed. I suffer day to day with overstimulation and panic attacks. She refuses to even take notice.   
I recently got into NJHS and she made it very clear I had to join. It wasn’t even a choice anymore. I ended up very stressed, as always. 

according to my mom, which, to her, I am nothing but a Cishet girl, I need to be ladylike. Formal, even for school, dresses and skirts only. Only because of my amazing friends and boyfriend have I managed to wear anything but. I’m very dysphoric and have pretty severe body issues. Because of this I often self harm, which is dangerous because I do competitive swim and soccer, so there is very little places to hide scars. 

a lot of my life I’ve been manipulated, forced into beliefs I don’t believe in- my entire family is Christian and look down upon anyone who isn’t. I’m the entire opposite. This causes arguments, especially when my mom checks my phone. 

on my phone my mom downloaded a parental service called bark. Parents on here, if any.

  
please, please, please please please please lPlease PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU NEVER GET THIS FOR YOUR CHILD. If you really want a tracker, use a different one, like life360 or something, only under 15-16 or so, PLEASE. Don’t. It’s ripped ALL of my privacy, all of my life. I cant talk to my only online friends- my strongest connections. My best friends. People I love like siblings. people who were more of a father to me than my own. 

winding Back to Motor Tick. For me, it used to be a repetitive clearing of my throat, but now it’s a small twitch in my upper stomach. It makes me twitch like I’m jumping at something that surprises me, but only I little. It’s only noticeable in some cases. But my mom and dad? They always notice. I do it while eatign without thinking, and suddenly I’m getting yelled at for disrespecting them. all the time. riding my bike? My bike gets taken if I twitch, wether it be from Motor Tick or not. Everything gets taken. I’ve had my HOMEWORK confiscated and then yelled at by my teachers because they don’t believe me. 

  
speaking of punishments. Some often include: pushing down stairs, not being allowed to sleep, no food until after bedtime (strictly not allowed to leave room after, not even for water.) I have to stock food in my room which is also very not allowed.

my doors aren’t allowed to be locked, not even when changing. (this is the SA part Following this) My dad sits outside the door when I shower , sometimes watching the curtain, sometimes watching ME. He sometimes, to rub it in, will make comments on my body. My weight fluctuates due to my instability in many factors, so I’m constantly dissed for my weight, wether it be under or over HIS beauty standard. His. My DAD. 



honestly why I’m saying all this is because I’ve been gaslighted enough to still want my parents around, even though I want so bad to get out of here and cut them off. And I don’t know if this is abuse or not. Help, also thanks for reading! "
"Mom wants me to forgive step dad

For some context, im 16, and my mom has severe anger issues. I had to run away to a friends house once because it got so bad, where everyday she would come home and take out her anger on me. 



We ended up “reconciling”(in reality she stopped for 2 weeks and only used emotional abuse, instead of slapping me whenever i spoke, some examples of this emotional abuse would be claiming i never help around the house, or saying it’s a “(my name) moment” when something bad happens, or claiming im always against her or saying i always do something i don’t do.


 However, 99% of the time besides those it’s just yelling at me to either shut up or nonsense about me that isn’t true. But i’ve grown accustomed to it and it actually doesn’t affect me much anymore. Now, to start the story. I was in the house cleaning with my stepdad and mom screamed at me over a stain behind the counter i didnt notice. She says a bunch of things on top of that i don’t remember because to cope i usually ignore whatever she says besides the command.

 I laughed it off a bit this time as an extra and according to my mother’s report my stepdad really didn’t like that.

 Now my mother finishes yelling at me, i finish cleaning and we go outside but right before my stepdad says to clean the stairs. im really pissed i just got yelled at so i say under my breath “dude  always telling me to do sum like he my dad” My stepdad hears this (or hears me say “fuck off” according to my mothers report later which i did not say) and says “who tf are you talking to” and starts choking me. 


i punch him and we get into a brawl(which i don’t remember much of, except for him biting my hand which my mom will not take time to the doctor for because she washed it with soap and water and put peroxide on it.) with my mom breaking us up.



 fast foward tldr because im tired of typing, i refuse to be alone with my stepdad because of this and today she’s forcing me to be alone in the house with him to clean up so she can have 1 good day that “i never let her have” She alsos saying “he’s open to forgiveness” as if he didn’t fucking attack me and i’m being selfish for giving her so much stress by complaining"
"My dad is 83 now and although I feel guilty I see him very rarely, when I make myself see him I remember why I don’t. He will fly off the handle over tiny things, he shouts, screams, throws things and insults me every time I see him and he’s always been like this (when we were younger he would hit us but he doesn’t do that anymore as ‘he knows he’s too weak and wouldn’t win’).
Today I go around to see him for the first time in months and the first thing he says is how fat and round my face is. I ask him why does this matter and he said it doesn’t. He then proceeds to say this every time he looks at me and after an hour (and after I had cleaned his home) I told him to stop calling me fat and he shouted at me telling me I’ve ’always been far too insecure over my weight’ and when I asked him why he thought this was he told me he didn’t know so I told him it was HIM. He has always told me I’m fat, stupid, lazy, useless. He’s told me all of my partners have been too good for me (even the abusive alcoholic) and has never had a good word to say about me but he was shocked that this has caused my feelings of insecurity?! Is he stupid? Or does he do it for the reaction?! He KNOWS I have a problem with my weight but he still says it and when I don’t react he says it until I do!? I’m not even actually fat? I’m a Uk size 8 but yes my face is round.
I’m so angry right now but I know in a couple of months I’ll feel guilty and go see him again and it’ll be the same outcome. Has anyone else had this cycle and how do I break it?

Tl;dr my dad calls me fat / insults me every time I see him but I feel guilty not seeing him because he’s old. What do I do?"
it’s been months since i’ve blocked my mom for talking shit about me. haven’t heard from her from my grandmother (i live with her and my mom lives in another country) so i don’t know if she knows i blocked her. it’s not like she has ever been interested into worrying about what her daughters are doing or how they’ve been. but sometimes it kinda hits me because how can you cope with the fact that your daughters don’t love you and you don’t seem to care? she just married her boyfriend so i guess there’s more important things in her life. 
"# 

I really am sick of this. My parents have been doing this since I was 6, The main thing is my dad. My father is blind and makes it his personality, he's calm at times but if your voice is tired, he snaps like ""DON'T GIVE ME THAT ADDITUDE"" or mumbles ""Oh f\*\*\*"" and If you try talking serious he just sighs and ignores me. On the other hand, we have my mother, She's been through all lot of stuff so she does have trauma I believe. Still one of the things she does is horrible, Let me play the conversation basically:

Me: "" Mom, do you think maybe you can set an appointment for me to get checked for a mental illness?

Mom: ""Oh gr-, Honey, If i can do it without all this things today, anyone can, also you never show signs of any mental illness s\*\*""

I have looked up my symptoms and secretly checked with online doctors , I have a high rating in Autism or ADHD but my parents are strict so knocking and privacy isn't real here, for example if you close the door as you use the restroom you get yelled at for probably doing weird things in there. Another example, if I bring up something that happened to my friend and stop speaking, they need to know. Most times I'll say ""No they asked me to keep it private"" while my dad and mom say ""B\*\*\*\* tell us. Is she doing drugs? Stop f\*\*\*ing being so god darn secretive!"" Yes they openly cussed around me since birth,. I'm only realizing its bad now.  
I do know that there is something wrong with me, at night for a good 15 minutes in my head I just hear laughing. Straight up laughing for 15 minutes. Each night.

I also have very weird habits, I love the sight of blood and killing just sounds fun-ish but also horrible? or something. I also stalk people for fun, its a weird addiction that kinda makes me excited, I will physically stalk and track everything about someone and randomly stop. My mom also hates that I'm ""In this phase"" I do not think I am in a phase and think I need mental help. But I guess self harm and anorexia doesn't need help in her eyes. My parents are both homophobic and are only fine with Lesbians, Bi, or Gay, Anything else n their eyes is ""mentally ill f\*\*\*ers"" If I came out as non-binary lesbian my mother and father would most likely hate me."
"Ive been thinking about this question for a while, and I think I’m wrong/overreacting cause he is sometimes nice. But he often hits us, gives me so much responsibility with my younger siblings. Often forgets me at school, leaving me to take care of me siblings. Let me give you a senario to understand.

One time, I had an after school activity at school, it was over, and I had a guitar make up lesson soon after, (as I missed one the previous week), and keep in mind, the activities at school end at around 4:45pm. I called my dad, who said, “I’m 15 minutes away, wait please.” I waited said 15 minutes. Called him again, “wait just 5 more minutes.” (FYI, my guitar lesson was at around 5:45, so we had to leave at maximum 5:15 if we wanted to make it, and that was the time. I panicked and called my mom, who said, “wait a couple minutes I’ll call him, I might have to get you a taxi.” I had never been in a taxi by myself at the time (I was 12 btw.) and was extremely socially anxious, so I hesitated. So I decided to wait. 
2 hours had past, I missed my guitar lesson, it was around 7pm, dad arrives. This has not been the first time this has happened, (but I end up going in the taxi)

Ok sorry, I’m rambling but I wanted to mention one last thing, he forgets me at my guitar lessons, doesn’t care for my events, (meaning he doesn’t care if I’m late, as it doesn’t concern him), and hits me a lot.
Is he neglectful and abusive? Or am I being ungrateful as he often spoils me at times."
"Are childhood spankings really meant to be this traumatic? 

Growing I was spanked somewhat frequently by my parents up until about age 6/7 and then it slowed down, I don’t remember much about those spankings thankfully. When I was 7, I was at grandmas house and was was spanked very hard with what I believe was to be a yardstick. She hit me 27 times as I counted. I was laying on the ground  and out of no where no warning or anything she somehow sneakily pulled my pants and underwear down without me noticing. How I don’t know and started spanking me very hard to were the bruises, blisters, and blood. The pain lasted for about a week. It hurt to sit down, I remember I had to sit on a towel that night in the bath because it hurt and the water stung, to the point of me crying in the bath that night. It was very traumatizing and even now as a adult I still regularly have ptsd from it, I wake up from nightmares dry heaving and having panic attacks over the years from it as a kid after it happened and as a adult. 
After that whenever my parents would try to spank me I was terrified and i would start shaking so bad to the point of having a seizure. From it. My last spanking was at 9 years old and thankfully after that incident spankings were infrequent and rare, I can’t even say I had a spanking at 8 and only once at 9, and no more after that. Are spankings really meant to be this bad, is it abuse or is it normal and I am just being sensitive and had a sensitive reaction to as a kid? I see all theses post about how people are happy they grew up with spankings and I just don’t get how someone can say that? "
"I am moving out of the house and my mother is abusive. I don't know what to do to help my sister before I move so she is ready. She is 11 and being an eleven year-old as any other. She doesn't like school, she avoids chores, she sneaks treats, and a few other things.   
I am used to being the one to take care of her, make sure she is doing her school work and eating well. Idk what she is going to do when I am gone. She is always told to be like me and I set a high standard since I picked up most of the slack my parents left behind them. I can't seem to help her understand that school and good grades is her ticket out of home early, that chores keep mom happy, and that hours of YouTube shorts a day is not only a poor way to spend her time but also unhealthy. I have two more weeks but it is starting to feel like not enough. I want her to have healthy things to lean to and habits to keep life comfortable like I had. I just don't want her to take years of abuse and trauma to build those things.   
Just simple stuff, like getting up early, avoiding life by focusing on school and hobbies more, and keeping things tidy.   
I would sleep til almost noon, avoid life by porn and drugs, and focus on video games and daydreams, and was a mess. It took me probably five years to switch those to the good things now. I have been trying to help her build good habits for a while now but I don't think she understands. I am worried she will have to figure it out herself but if I had been one inch off track I would be a dropout since my freshman year running away from home and getting into fights, or I may have gone through with my suicide. 

I don't want her to go through the same things I did, I want to help her skip them. But she is tired of listening to me cause I ""never"" let her eat treats and ice cream or skip chores for a day. I don't think she understands the importance of some of it.   
I am currently trying a chart I used/use to get myself out of depression, where it is a checklist starting with basic daily hygiene, going to productive things (Chores and school), and ending in-game time and fun.   
What else can I do?"
"I won't bother with much detail because I have already gone through therapy and I've been out of contact with them for years.
I was going through my drive to find my resume to make updates and happened to see  her new email address started with  ""brokenheartedmother."". I emailed and called shortly after , because as much as she was the reason I felt desperate enough to become a sex worker ( I've gotten out of that since), and she convinced me my worth was so little that I stayed in another very abuse relationship for 7 years without reaching out, she was also the one that saved me from the same feeling when I was a pre- teen ( sort of- she did physically but I was then separated from the family for a year and was diagnosed Mood NOS in an american psych ward). I still feel really bad, I have to go to bed soon and I wouldn't want her to hurt herself and the email name is a huge red flag- I'm assuming the worst. I have no idea what is going on with her and I'm scared. She doesn't live in town, I don't  have a car or her address.I'm trying to journal it out but I need some feedback/advice... I'm going to try to get more therapy tomorrow. This is so confusing- if anyone else has been through this sort of thing... tell me what you did!"
"Neither option is good but which one do you think would be worse or is worse to deal with?

Parents who physically hit their kids, OR parents who are emotionally/verbally abusive towards their kids? "
"Hi, this is my second post here. I'm asking for advice this time because I'm really at a loss.

I'm an adult who had to move back in with my abusive parents after being out on my own for a significant period of time. It's been such a degrading experience that I sometimes wonder if I would've been better off just being homeless. 

I've been working a lot on trying to set boundaries in general. I essentially had zero autonomy as a child/teen and because of this I became a people pleaser who let everyone walk all over me like a doormat. I'm done being that way. It's fucking exhausting.

The thing is, it's nigh impossible to set even simple boundaries with my parents. They still treat me like a child/teen (if you read my last post it was about how they still try to ground me and take my things away when I pay the bill for it, ex. my phone) and they refuse to accept that I'm an adult now.

Recently I got a new job that pays a significantly better wage than what I was making before. I'm so happy because this may finally be my chance to get back out from under their roof. The thing is, the on-boarding process has been slow. Lots of training, and then waiting for the state to approve my certificates, etc. For the past month or so my mother has been asking me five or six times a day, every single day, if I've heard anything from my job. And I'm not even exaggerating. It's the same question, five times a day, seven days a week, for the past month. It drives me up the fucking wall.

My mother, besides being extremely manipulative and sometimes physically violent, is a very nosy person and will be absolutely relentless when it comes to getting any information she wants, whether it's her business or not. It's very much a habit for her to harp on me and my sibling (who is also an adult and lives here) about anything and everything, because she claims ""nothing gets done if I'm not breathing down your neck."" It's incredibly invasive, and besides that it's not even effective. My temperament heavily aligns with symptoms of pathological demand avoidance, which means her ""reminders"" and frequent questions have the opposite effect and only serve to cause me more anxiety and resentment.

I've tried to be very firm with her. I've told her multiple times to stop asking me about my job and that I'll tell her when I hear something, so she doesn't need to ask. She always responds with threats of violence and says that it doesn't matter how many times she asks me something, if she asks me a question I am to answer it without argument or complaint, lest I want to get beaten. I know these are probably just empty threats because if she really wanted to beat me she would have already, but she's beaten me before and I know for a fact she would do it again.

Yesterday I told her again to stop asking me. That this is a non-negotiable boundary I'm standing on, and if she continues to ask me from this point forward I'm just going to ignore her. She said that I'm never allowed to ignore her for any reason and that if I do ignore her there will be consequences (again, threatening violence.)

I know this is probably such a simple and trivial thing but it honestly wouldn't matter what boundary I was trying to set. If I do anything at all that they dislike they threaten and harass me. I just don't know what to do because when I do get out of this house I'm going no-contact with both of them, and I'm terrified because I know they'd go to the ends of the earth to force me to stay in their lives. I've dealt with harassment from non-family members before and unfortunately law enforcement was not helpful about it whatsoever, so I have very little hope I'll ever be able to cut contact with them at all."
"I was somewhat abused by my parents growing up, and I think they both have anger issues and problems with lack of emotion/empathy. It's gotten better in recent years but we still argue sometimes.

However, on days like today, sometimes my dad just snaps at me out of nowhere. He yelled, saying that /I/ was being rude to him and had a bad temper. We'd been having a conversation for the past 15 minutes, and whilst I was a little frustrated having to explain something to him over and over again, I was by no means being rude.

I go up to my room, and was honestly triggered by him shouting, it brought me back to when I was a kid.

Within minutes, he comes to my door, POUTING LIKE A TODDLER and asks me what I want for dinner (as a way of apologising without actually having to admit he's in the wrong). He does this often and it pisses me off so much.

Why do you have the right to treat me like shit, then try to guilt me by acting like a child WHEN YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD.

It just make me feel so shit when he yells at me and has no empathy, because I'm alone in this world and have no one else to comfort me or show me affection."
"(Throw away account, female (20y)

So this has happened for a couple of years, especially when I was a teenager ( I give her the benefit of the doubt because I was a shit teenager) but I finally moved out at 18 and went to university. Fast forward 2 years, I had a few things happened and I was going to become homeless. During the time I was living away from my mum she kept asking and telling me to move back if everything wasn’t okay and I finally did, I had no home and I needed somewhere to live. So after her telling me time and time again to move back with her to get back on my feet, I did. 

I have only been living here for a couple of months, trying to find a job, paying rent with the money I have saved up because I can’t live here free. But since moving back I keep getting told “I never want you”, “when you move out again stay out”, “I wished I dropped you at a foster home after your dad passed away”, “you never do anything here” (I cook and clean almost everyday). I also get told about my physical appearance “jeez you have gotten big”, “you look fat in that”, “you look homeless, wear nicer clothes”. 

And I understand a mother should never say stuff like that to her children but she is my mum and I love her. But recently it’s been more bad things than good things. And I don’t know what I need to do, cause I can’t really leave I need to stay here to earn money so I can move out again. But I also can’t leave the room when she is saying shit like that to me even though I have explained to her that I need to leave the room right now can we talk about this in 10-20mins. 

And it’s also not just me that feels like this, I have three other brothers that agree. But I also believe she is worse with me because it a mother-daughter relationship and she never got along with her mum or even her sister. "
"I was in a relationship for 5 years,  3 years in  we had a daughter. My partner and I were really disconnected and had large boundaries  from both of our families for valid reasons I’ll touch on a bit later . My ex partner, 2 year old and I lived together in our own house we rented until we split up. After 5 years went by and after having a child my partner cheated on me with a 60 year old and walked away from us and the affair had gotten my ex  (daughter’s mom) involved into a cult which drove her mad.  Little to say I have full custody and my daughters  mom and hasn’t been around for 2 years now.  Needless to say, I’m 25 and I’m still building my career in life so I don’t make crazy amount of money (can’t afford daycare, rent ,and living costs a lone). This had forced me to reach out to my abusive mother  for a living arrangement (only family I have) , who struggles with a narcissistic personality and suffers from Borderline personality disorder and who had mentally abused me at a very young age .I go through a tough breakup and I lose my inner family,  , just to have to move into my controlling mothers home with my 3 year old . My mom has phases where she is a great person but also has weeks or days where she a horrible person, almost like I’m not her son and my child isn’t her granddaughter I’m sure this falls into having BPD.  I’m struggling mentally and I know my child needs me mentally present. I’ve tried having serious convos with my mom about my mental health and our relationship/ possibly having counseling  to improve our relationship but she takes it as a joke/bullies and only blames me. My mom watches my 3 year old while I’m at work ( I do pay her) but she doesn’t seem very attentive to her, meaning my mom will sit on her phone while my child will self entertain. The moment I get home from work my mom kicks up her feet and she no longer helps me with anything which I can understand because she isn’t her parent and she isn’t obligated too. I work hvac construction so I’m fairly tired when I get home (in a 120°F attic most of the time). My mom doesn’t abide by any of my parenting rules , so naturally my child looks at me like I’m bad cop and even calls me mean from time to time and has grandma syndrome . I feel like I’m losing my patience way more and it’s hard to focus on my day to day life due to these  distractions . I have no idea what to do besides when my daughter turns 4 this fall get her enrolled in school and find an apartment and cut my mother off. Any suggestions?

"Uhh, are my parents abusive?? Idk if they are or not.. uh they are extremely homophobic and transphobic, my dad threatened to kick me into the basement because I told my younger sibling girls can marry girls. My mom and dad have screamed at me just because I didn't have my hair up and I've been beaten and yelled at for not smiling in pictures. I've been hit with a wooden stick thing, walker, before, because my sisters were fighting or smth. My mom yells/screams at me for little things. Just today some of my friends reported my self harming and depression to a school counselor and they called my dad, and he beat me and said ""if I hear that shit again, ***I'm*** gonna hurt you"" so tomorrow I have to pick up every stick and leaf in the backyard and I'm grounded, very grounded.. My parents aren't always mean, beating/hitting is the punishment here but they are nice sometimes. They aren't alcoholics or anything. They can be nice, they just don't seem to care about my mental health, or anything I like/wanna do. My mom said she sees an ""image"" for me in the future and me being a trans masc doesn't fit her image, as well as me liking same gender/sex. But they are nice most the time?? My dad will get grumpy/mad at everyone when he is in a bad mood which is.. daily, happens at some point in the day. I just don't know if I'd consider them abusive?? These are just some things they do any well, it seems physical punishment is normal?? Idk, I like my parents when they aren't yelling at me/in a bad mood. They can be pretty nice. I don't remember the last time I've had loving affection from them but like, I am 14 so ig it's normal, plus I have younger siblings they have to give attention to. They think about my interests and seem to care, well, my interests and likes they approve of, like drawing. My mom won't let me get a haircut cus I'll cut it too short and she won't like it :/ she said she'll take me to get highlights tho so, ig I have that.. won't get rid of my gender dysphoria but according to her it will make me feel better about it so."
"my mom has always been abusive to me. Ever since i remember existing she would hit me or scream at me for the smallest stuff. She never played with me as a kid. She was in a bad mood 24/7 so i could never even have a normal conversation with her (i got used to it quickly). She would beat me in public, and if i cried she would force me to stop. We moved to america a couple years ago and im almost 18 now. She is still very mentally abusive. But she stopped hitting me. Shes never sorry for hurting me, she never admits that shes wrong. And whenever she hurts me i start crying and screaming because i just want this nightmare to end. And whenever i start screaming she says that im disrespecting her, she mocks me when i cry, she tells me to stop crying, she threatens to send me back to the country we came from. And she knows that i love it here and that if we go back i will literally lose everything and just kill myself. But she doesnt care. She blames everything on me. She keeps saying hurtful things and expects me not to cry. I cant even tell anyone from my family because they will tell her that i talked to them about it and she will get even more mad. I just want this to end. And she keeps saying that she regrets taking me to america with her because i make her life harder. I want her to respect my feelings. I want everything to be fine. I want a normal happy family like all of my friends have. I want to be able to come home from school without being scared of whats going to happen to me. I want to run away. I cant do this anymore i know that this will never end. No matter how much she ""apologizes"". No matter how much i tell her that she hurts me. She just doesnt give a shit. Im on the verge of killing myself. The only thing thats keeping me alive is my girlfriend. But this is not helping me anymore either. "
"It’s just so sad seeing my mom like that. Like seeing an animal stuck in a trap. They don’t  understand how they got there and why they can’t get out of it.

I know she’s alone because of her actions toward pretty much every person she ever knew. I finally accepted she would never change no matter how hard I tried. I just can’t help but feel guilty because it was supposed to be my job to take care of her"
"For context, I am 15 (transmasc) and live with her. I have had problems with my mother for a while now, and my boyfriend has been saying what I'm telling him about my mom sounds like abuse. She (almost) never hits me, so it didn't cross my mind at first, but it's getting worse and I'm terrified of her to the point of panic attacks when I think about standing up to her. She had always been a loving mom in my opinion, but when I turned around 11/12, things began going downwards with our relationship. 

Recently I had wanted to go up to my room with my partner and watch a movie, she was not ok with this (which is understandable) but I had offered for my 11 y/o sister to come and watch it with us, and promised the door would remain open and no innapropriate things would happen. My mother is very against me having almost any physical contact with my boyfriend, which includes cuddling, even right in front of her with just his arm around me. My boyfriend decided to try and talk to my mother about how she treats him as if he only thinks about/wants sex from our relationship (He's on the asexual spectrum) and he felt disrespected, so mentioned that he didn't feel very respected at all, and my mother yelled at him and kicked him out, demanding respect. Afterwards, I wanted to talk to her, so we sat on opposite sides of my door and I told her how I felt about her. I told her that I just wanted love from my partner, and that not everything leads to sex and she needs to learn that. She responded by yelling at me through the door, then i told her I'm done with the conversation and asked her to leave, to which she slammed my door open and began screaming at me that I'm so disrespectful and that the world revolves around me, and how I'm selfish and I must think shes stupid for saying that I don't just want sex from my boyfriend. I was afraid she was going to hit me (she didn't) and I backed away into the wall, she continued screaming at me and cussing me out, while I slumped to the floor crying and saying I'm scared. She told me to get the fuck downstairs and that she was going to call my dad. I told her I need to be alone and she thought I was going to try and kill or hurt myself, I told her I wouldn't, and she yelled to keep my door open and that I'm so damn selfish, I got the nerve to ask her why she was like this and she just scoffed at me and mimicked the question back to me, then left.

There have been more situations very similar to this, where she did hit me (not hard, and usually just my hand or arm) and I'm beginning to think she might not be the hero of a mom I though she was. She has threatend me previously, with my comforts (music, my bf, my stuffies, ect) and has sometimes not let me eat. She goes out almost every weekend to drink and get fucked, coming home either really late, or the next day, leaving me to babysit my younger siblings ( 2, 7, and 11 y/o's), then I have to take care of her while she's hung over, I make breakfast, lunch, I bring her everything she needs while she sleeps all day. Yesterday, she had a breakdown in my arms, sobbing and sniffling, I had just been crying and she knew that but still expected comfort from me, she has a good reason to be sad, her bestfriends death was a year ago yesterday. But she's been making me take care of my sibling so often they feel like my own kids. My sister (11) feels a similar way about our mother. 

Idk if this is enough info, but please give me your opinions and advice"
"my parents always favour my younger brother they never abuse him like me if i try to defent myself in any situation my father would say dont talk back to me and beat me up this first happen when i was around 12 and still continue till this day and my mother also treat me the same while even if my brother talk back to them an say what ever

"Be really careful who you marry and have as the mother of your children. Today coming back to my parents after being redundant, I've noticed how fkd up everything is with my separate parents in the same house. My dad is in bad debt (1000s) he's the only one paying for the house since my mum refuses to work and spends disability money on herself. She even got a ""service dog"" costing 1000s and he's an aggressive untrained German Shepherd that terrifies my autistic brother. He's broken 2 doors, ripped shoes, clothes and the washing line. He's destroying everything just like she did to the house and family. She's never worked put us in debt so many times and forced her way in all our lives. Only my brother celebrates mother's day with her and she just let the dog scratch him up BC he was ""excited"". I thought when I was younger theyd split, she'd leave or at least get a job but dkn Centrelink pays her and her sisters for doing jack.

"First of all my parents are more neglectful than abusive and I don't know if this is the correct place to ask since I don't know a lot about subreddits. My apologies if this doesn't belong here.
So, around january this year I found a kitten, it is a female and we already have a male cat with us, my parents loved the kitten and pretended there was no way to find her another household so we kept her.
The problem is, my parents are against sterilisation on animals,  also my male cat is completely emaciated since he fights with a ton of other cats for females in my town. Since I found this kitten my siblings and I have been trying to convince my parent to sterilise the female cat since we think it'll be awful for her and us to be having kittens every once in a while (It's not the first time we are in this kind of situation and what they do is wait for the kittens to be old enough to be with another family) So right now both of the cats are trying to mate.
 Is there any way I can convince my parents to sterilise at least one of the cats? I can't get in too much trouble with them since they are pretty toxic and can't discuss things properly, there was already a time my father and I had a heated argument about not mating MY dog with his coworker's dog. 
And I can't take her to the vet myself since i don't have any money. "
"my family was running errands all morning (grocery shopping, etc) and everything was “normal.” my mother and i spent the morning talking, listening to music, we even stopped and got coffee before we tackled todays list of errands. 

then, after we had finished doing everything we needed to, we began to head home. 

on the ride home i put on one of my favourite songs, rested my head against my seat, and closed by eyes for a bit (as one does when they are feeling tired). 

SUDDENLY— my mother *screamed* at me. top of her lungs red face bulging veins kind of scream. she lectured me to “WAKE UP” and that “ALL I DO IS SLEEP” — startled by her suddenly yelling at sat up and informed her that i wasn’t actually sleeping i was just chilling. 

she proceeded to yell at me - screaming inside the car about how “USELESS” i am and that i never help around the house (a complete lie considering the only way to earn my mothers love is to sweet the floor and empty the dishwasher — i was also gardening with her the day before since she asked for my help. i *always* help, and i have no problem helping.). 

i was on the verge of tears - who wouldn’t be after being called stupid, useless, lazy, and good-for-nothing when all you were doing was CHILLING ON A CAR RIDE HOME. when my voice cracked as i explained that i was confused where this was coming from she started mocking me, “wah wah wah my life is sooo hard!! im going to go cry now.” 

i was speechless. the rest of my family in the back of the car was speechless. 

she does this a lot - she’ll be so kind for a short period of time and then she’ll just SNAP. i’m exhausted and i honestly don’t know what to do. 

help? advice? a gentle hand? i’d appreciate anything really…"
" I didn't know if some furniture was being built or not so I ask my dad and he stared building it. Later he needed my help with something and I needed to help him hold something. It was too heavy and he started saying things like I'm a fucking idiot and stuff. Then he hit his head really hard and I went downstairs to talk to my mom and she was saying that he was acting like a child. Idk what to do, I'm crying in my room. He was already abusing me and possibly my mom. I have ptsd and the only person who cares can't do anything at all."
"Guess what it's mother's day on Sunday. And I have an abusive mother. Now she doesn't know it's mother's day tomorrow and I won't tell her. But I can't help but wonder why she's a mother. She physically, emotionally and mentally abuses her children and then she blames everything on them. So I don't she deserves a gift at all. I don't think anyone besides my grandma does. Every woman in my family besides my grandma is the same they all normalize abuse. So happy mother's day to the good mother's who actually love their children. And to those who abuse their kids you don't deserve shit."
"My mother has been abusing me since I was a kid. And to be honest growing up I thought that was normal. Because everyone in my family would tell me if your parents hit you it's OK. But when I turned 11 I realized my entire family was full of lies and child abusers. At this point my moms abuse has increased. And not just physical emotional and mental. She would insult me and my siblings day and night. Sometimes even for no reason. Whenever she calls me she doesn't call me by my name she calls me by an insult, multiple insults. Last night she pulled my hair just because I said “be quiet it's late don't yell”. Like I'm not disrespecting you I'm just trying to tell you to lower your voice cause people were sleeping. She always does this. I'm currently 13 years old I have been dealing with this shit for tool long. I've tried running away once but I came back because it was winter in Minnesota. I can't call cpd because I have 7 siblings and I don't want us to get separated. And I'm tried of the “just have patience this will end”. I have been waiting for so long. But no one can Dela with shit every single day. And I can't tell a relative cause they're all the same. They all normalize abuse and call it “parenting”. I just wish someone would help. I wish I had a place to stay anywhere. I wish I could runaway. Cause my mother has told me that if I left her house she would consider me dead and not existing. She told me “if you don't like this house than you can leave”. I want to leave but where would I go. I'm depressed and I'm insecure about my body, and my mom has to make it worse by calling me fat and ugly. If anyone can help on anyways please help me. I can't take this shit anymore.

"TW: Suicide

She's nice sometimes. She tells us she loves us. She puts food on the table. She buys us presents. But she also does things that leave permenant mental scars on me and my brother. I admit, we are hard to deal with, to say the least. But today my brother told me he's suicidal. He's 10. So something has snapped inside me.

Earlier this evening, my brother came home from his friend's house and asked if they could have a sleepover. My mum said no. Not nicely, she said it in a very nasty tone. Then my brother moaned out of frustration, I mean he's 10, to be expected. But suddenly my mum just broke and started hitting him, then saying she's gonna kill herself, she's gonna kill him, kick him out, disown him. She started throwing things. She said she's gonna run away. She tried, my brother held her back, she said stop touching me, get out of my sight, all while my father stood there and did nothing. I tried to calm the situation, it worked after a while. I just thought back to the times she said the same to me. They're distant memories, all I remember are a few words, but the pain of those words, even the ones I don't remember, is crystal clear. There was times she told me she'd kill herself and me, times she hit me, times she smashed things in front of me. But there was also times she hugged me, kissed me on the cheek, bought me presents. I am so conflicted, this is the strangest most painful feeling I've ever felt.

I went into my room and researched for a bit. I searched up characteristics of an abusive parent, and I was confident that she was abusive. So I brought my brother into my room and told him ""Mum is abusing you. Don't listen to all these things, don't take them to heart. When you're my age, you're gonna face some serious insecurity. And you're gonna think back to these moments and hate yourself for it. But don't make the same mistake I did, it's not your fault.""

After that my brother's friend came over to our house and said he wanted to sleep over since he's also having family issues and he wants to get away for a bit. Finally my mum accepted. I was glad my brother had someone to distract him. But I didn't, my friends definitely weren't allowed to come over. I did talk to them over text though, and they all think she's abusive.

A few minutes ago before my brother and his friend headed to bed, he asked our mother if she still loves him and she said no. I can already see him looking back on this as a teen and just drowning in self hatred. I can see him in my position.

Even after all that, as I'm typing this, thinking of all the good things she's done for us, and all the annoyance we've caused her, I'm not even sure if my feelings are valid or if I'm being dramatic. So I want your opinion. She leaves permanent mental scars on us, she's made us have suicidal thoughts, but are we just being dramatic or is this really something to be concerned about? I'm scared that it really is abuse, and if I just brush it off once again like I always do, it might end up worse next time. I really have no idea. But I know for a fact, if she is abusive, something really bad is gonna happen. I don't want to be convinced otherwise and fall into the cycle again for no reason. I want to be sure of it. Is she abusive or not? Please help me."
"Hi I came on here to ask if this was just a punishment or like physical abuse. So from when I was 4-15(my current age) my father has punished me and my sister by staying in push-up position for hours when we would act out or do something to make him mad. He would yell at us while he forced us to stay in pushup position as we cried and pleaded to stop. If we got out of push up position he would slam things against walls to make noise and scare us into doing what he wanted. I recently asked my sister what she remembers about her childhood before I was born and she mentioned how my dad used to hit her. To me this seems very possible given how often we were scared shitless that he would hit us and the form of punishment he uses. If only one of us (me or my sister) were in trouble he would punish us the same way, expect he would make us watch the other one in pain. I rember one time when I was around ten he made us do push-up position in the middle of an ace hardware store and yelled at us about embarrassing we are. 


Anyways, is this abuse or just punishment??"
"Hello, does anyone here have experience with moving out and starting uni while completely cut off from your family? Or should I just work for a year and then start?"
"Hi all. I have been talking with my therapist about this a lot recently and she suggested I reach out to a group of people who might better understand what I'm going through, so here I am. Not really looking for advice as I know what to do in these situations now, just trying to get a little frustration off my chest. Some background about me and my family to preface:

My parents have always been authoritative in their parenting style, very akin to how my grandparents raised them. They're very rarely physically abusive but beatings have never been totally out of the question, even as I've emerged into adulthood. I frequently get told ""I can still whoop your ass,"" mostly as a scare tactic, but I have no doubt they would still do so if they felt inclined. They are both extremely manipulative in many different ways, verbally and psychologically abusive. I have been guilt tripped, gaslit, threatened (and more!) all my life. I know not all narcissists are abusive by default and I don't want to paint all of them in a bad light, but I would be lying if I said narcissistic abuse isn't a real thing that I’ve been subject to my entire life. Both my parents are incredibly entitled, but especially my dad, who very much has grandiosity, a lack of empathy, and exhibits exploitive behavior, among other things.

When I was almost 21, I got a stable and well-paying job that allowed me to move out on my own. I signed a year lease on a shitty cheap apartment because I was desperate to get out from under my parents' roof. It was the best year of my life and full of so much discovery and healing. I was living paycheck-to-paycheck, and despite rent taking up more than half of my income most months I was just happy to finally be on my own.

When my year lease was up, I had to move back into my parents' house. My landlord was going to raise my rent by over $300 if I were to renew my lease, and I just couldn't afford it. I essentially had two options: move back in with my parents or be homeless. Reluctantly I chose the former, knowing it would only be temporary, and at the very least I would have my own room and a warm bed to sleep in.

Soon after I moved in with my parents, I got laid off from my job. It was a *huge* setback. I quickly found another job but it only paid about half as much. I went from making $21/hr to $12/hr.

Despite this I did not have to pay rent (sort of. my parents force me to pay them $150 a month to contribute to the mortgage payment) and was completely financially independent when it came to all my other expenses. Phone bill, car insurance, car payment, credit card, gas, food, you name it, I paid for it myself. The only thing my parents helped me out with was health insurance, because I'm chronically ill and sometimes the meds I need can be very expensive.

Despite being almost completely independent financially and having paid out of pocket myself to own the majority of my possessions, My parents still frequently threaten to take these things away if they dislike how I behave, their reasoning being that ""Your things are in my house, and I pay the mortgage, therefore your possessions actually belong to me."" which isn’t even true, since they make me contribute to the mortgage payments anyways. For instance, I got into an argument with my father last December, wherein he took away my phone, my laptop, and my car keys. I am almost 23 years old. The title of the car and the phone line are in my name and I exclusively pay for them. I had to call out of work for two days and explain to my supervisor that my dad had stolen my car keys and wouldn't give them back, so I wasn't able to drive to and from work. It was very embarrassing and humiliating to have to explain that as an adult I had essentially been *grounded*.

In hindsight, I should have called the cops as soon as it happened. I have verifiable proof that all of the things he *grounded* me from belong to me. I'm not sure why I didn't, but I know now that if something like that ever happens again, that's the action I can take. They have not taken any more of my possessions since then, but they still frequently threaten to do so. I have told them multiple times that I am an adult and they can no longer ground me as if I were a teenager, especially when I pay to have these things, but they don't care.

I've started keeping a log with dates and times of every time they threaten to take my things just in case I need it. I have a paper copy of my car's title and proof of my phone bill payments hidden away so if the time ever comes where I do need to take action against them I will have everything I need to prove my case. And I had an extra hidden set of car keys made in the event that the original ones are taken.

I don't really know what else to say other than that. I just feel stuck here, I guess. I'm so fed up with my boundaries being blatantly disrespected every single day even though I've worked so incredibly hard to be assertive about them.

If you've ever experienced anything like this and you're comfortable sharing, please let me know. I know I can't be the only one. If you made it to the end, thank you for reading this far. <3"
"Hi everybody , I’m sorry for putting this out here but need some advice.

For context I’m a 24 year old male staying with my 30 year old sister in the city as we both have jobs 

Back in our small hometown stays my mother ,father and small brother who has cerebral palsy ( can’t walk or talk but feels every emotion)

My father is a man who I would describe as a narcissist and egoistic man . He doesn’t have a job and doesn’t pay any bills , he leaches off my mother and is staying under her roof .

He’s always been like that since young , a very violent and aggressive man , it’s always his way or the highway . If nothing goes his way , he’ll end up taking out the frustration either on my mother, me or my sister . When it comes to my sick brother , he is not present at all . He would only speak to my brother maybe 5 mins a day and the rest must be done by my mother 

Since my sister and I have moved from home due to us currently working , we haven’t been in much contact with him( he only calls us if he needs money) but we speak to our mother everyday.
 

Recently my mother has been in shambles and is sick of him leaching off her ( any woman would feel that way after 30 years of marriage).

And when she brought it up , he went enter this state of complete mental distortion and keep on swearing her and beating her .. while my sick brother watches and cries.

I want to help her in anyway possible but my mum said that it would be dangerous for me to go there and take her away as he might do something to me or my sister (he has in the past).

I can’t stand to see my mother and brother in this state , it makes me sick .. I don’t know what to do ,iv asked her multiple times now and in the past “why don’t you leave him?”

She says she can’t leave him as that’s the only support she has with her own family not in the picture and me and my sister living in the city .

But I mean , is being beaten up and sworn at everyday worth this so called “support”

I’m not sure what to do , even if we call the cops , they are corrupted and would let him go since he has connections and would just make the situation even worse .

I just need some advice from anybody who has experienced this type of trauma and what to do because I’m genuinely out of hope?"
"My earliest memory was him watching Halloween with me when I was a toddler. Then it was him chasing me around with a scream mask when I was about 5 years old. When I was in 3rd grade, he would jumpscare me every day when I came home from school. I would usually get upset when he did it, and his response was always like ""why are you so sensitive"" or ""it's just a joke, why don't you laugh, crybaby?!"", etc. I mean, sure I probably would have thought it was funny if you didn't fucking force feed me horror movies as a kid, then complain when I hated it. Duh. To this day, I get startled very easily, and sometimes I can get irritated if someone comes up behind me and jumpscares me. I've also witnessed my dad scaring my 3 year old nephew from behind, and he was visibly shaken afterward. From time to time I remember these things and I just start getting angry thinking about it. And that's just the tip of the iceberg with him, he's done way worse to me, but that's another story. Why would anyone enjoy scaring kids? Was he a psychopath? 

"
My father cheated and lied to my mother their entire marriage. He even convinced me and my siblings that she was crazy and making everything up which caused us to resent her for some time. Now that I know the truth I’m just angry. I wish I could confront him but I’m still scared of him. A lot of things from my childhood are coming back to haunt me as of lately. I messaged my old teacher who used to go out of her way to embarrass me in front of my peers the other night. I’m just angry and I don’t know what to do. I have never been to therapy because I know it will only traumatize me again. I just wish I could move on but it’s not that easy.
"I (20F) have a little sister (12F) who lives with her dad (63M) still. I moved out at 16 due to his verbal/emotional abuse and alcoholism. I’ve kept low contact with him but have tried to stay in my sister’s life by texting her regularly and having her come stay with me for a night here and there. I know narcissists never change, he is a textbook example of one and if it weren’t for her I would’ve gone no contact with him when I left. 

After I moved out, I called CPS on him and visited a domestic violence officer (RCMP) with video evidence of my dad physically abusing my sister. This asshat told me it wasn’t abuse, it was discipline. This still makes me sick to this day. CPS visited the home a couple times and after talking to my dad, closed the file. He’s very good at manipulation and lying, and instructed us kids to do the same if anyone ever asked about what happened inside the home.

I found out recently that he is still drinking regularly despite claiming for years that he’ll stop.
He had pulled my sister out of school to “homeschool” her for a couple years, before enrolling her in the outreach that I went to when I was 15. She’s still there. I’ve reached out to the teachers a couple times, requesting that they keep an eye on her and they’ve assured me she is safe when she is there but aren’t able to disclose any info. That’s fine. I would like to know what other avenues I can follow to make sure that my sister isn’t being screamed at, abused, and malnourished like I was. Shes 12 turning 13 in a couple months, but still has the skeletal lankyness of a 9 year old. I’m so worried about her. She doesn’t tell me anything about how her dad treats her but I have enough experience with him to know that she could very well be neglected and abused to some degree. 

I have considered calling a welfare check on her, but what would that really do especially with his past of manipulation. I absolutely do not want to risk having that contact with her cut off. 
Any advice helps. Thanks. "
"I live in Indiana and I have a friend who's ex boyfriend was abusive.  She is worried about when/if he gains visitation rights that he will be abusive towards the children.  Is it legal for the children to record without his knowledge, and if so what are the best ways to do so.
   The kids are 11 and 3, which the 3 yo is his bio kid, so it would 100% be that one that he has.  It's still up in the air if he would pursue rights for the other or if the other would go as well to protect the younger.   Using a phone would probably not be an option if the 3 yo were to go alone."
"long story short, i’m not being abused. my two adopted sister are being abused by my aunt. and kinda my mum. my mum knows and kinda encourages it. i have been emailing social services and i have proof. they want it. they said my auntie is lovely and they don’t see anything wrong. i have to send proof soon…. or not… i don’t HAVE to but am i a bad person if i dont…? because if i send it i will be found out and my mum isn’t the best mum in the world.. id be grounded and shunned from the family… i am 15 right now so i cant move out or anyhtitn either…

i asked to be kept anonymous and for the voice memos to be kept hidden but they told me no they aren’t doing that.. please help me asap.."
"I am now old enough to leave home, and have very mixed emotions about the subject. My mother started hitting me when I was five, I see my dad every week but he is completely oblivious and suffers with some mental health issues- he's a really lovely guy, a bit soft, though, and my mum manipulates and walks all over him.  She hasn't worked in years, instead stays in her pigsty of a room in a flat we're probably gonna be kicked out of, squeezing my dad for every last drop. The abuse was really bad when I was around twelve; I got severely beat up almost every week and hit or punched pretty much every day. Of  course, there is also constant emotional abuse. I am sixteen now, and while my mental health is the worst it's ever been, I only get hit every three to four weeks (depending on if I've actually done something really stupid or provoked her). My nerves are completely frazzled having to look after her and constantly wary of an attack. The thing is though, I would only have to wait another two years and I know many people have it much worst and just see it through till they're an adult. I'm also worried about the effect moving would have on my education and academic interests, and I don't know if I would feel justified moving out now that things have cooled down to a constant low-grade background pollutant of loathing and not me literally being stabbed with a fork. If anyone has any advice, that would be really helpful. I live in the UK by the way."
"Ii swear I'm trying to get myself killed. I'm sick of my mum so whenever she does something bad, rude, wrong or hypocritical I call her out on it. So today my sister did have a bit of an attitude discussing something with my mum and my mum had an attitude too. After they sorted it out my mum turned to my sister and was like ""do you want to apologise for your attitude."" Really rudely. My sister obviously carelessly apologised and I just sat there and was like ""well TBF you had an attitude too"" to which my mum almost shouted (she was trying to keep her cool) saying ""i did not speak to her the way she just did to me thank you!"" I thought she might hurt me... But she didn't, we good. Apparently I really wanted to die so I kept going and said ""yeh that's cos you two have different voices. Of course you're gonna sound different"" ... My sister agreed with me the entire time though 🤣

What is wrong with me? Why am I choosing death? "
"Both of my parents have mentally abused me for as long as I can remember (telling me I have mental disorders, that there are many things wrong with me, threatening me to kick me out of the house...). And my father sexually abused me when I was a child.

I have tried countless times to talk with them about how these events affect me, but they just seem to get offended, and start insulting me all over again.

  
I'm desesperate and cannot take this any longer.

  
Is there any way for me to move out of this house? Or what other options have I got?

Do I need any evidence? If so, what kind?

# I live in Spain.

  
I tried to lok for information on this country's goverment's web, but it is so very confusing, and did not find anything.

  
Thank you, from the very bottom of my heart, for reading this.

Have a great day."
This has been happening to me lately.  Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on stopping it? Thanks
"So I've struggled with depression during my teenage years, which led to my room being a bit messy as a kid. I've since learned how to clean after it was beaten into me growing up. However, I've relapsed some since getting my own place hours away and grad school and jobs have been keeping me busy.

I graduate soon, and there's a gap between the end of the ceremony and celebration dinner reservations with family and friends. My mom (the physically abusive one) has said that since my grandparents are coming, this would be a good time for everyone to ""see if my childhood lessons have held up"" in terms of keeping my apartment straight. 

I immediately said I wouldnt allow them inside, but mostly because I don't want to be in a room alone with them and that because I will admit, there is a bit of mess (I live in a studio). My mother has taken this so far as to say that she will call my apartment manager to get inside.

My father (he sa'd me until age 10 but I never spoke up about it bc I've only just begun to realize that's what was happening) has stated that if they cant go to my apartment, then I'll lose any financial help. I dont really ask them for anything except if rent hits right after taxes this year.

I'm terrified of my parents and I finally felt free having my own space that hasn't been touched by my parents or grandparents. I want to stand firm because it's my graduation but I'm scared that I'll be alone with only two friends as a support system.

Are there any tips for standing my ground that won't completely ruin things?

"So I’m 18 and my parents have been very abusive since my brother passed away in 2017. 
While that is a major part of the reason I want to leave I originally planned on saving money from my job to buy a cheap mobile home at the beginning of next year. I just found out today (on accident) that 2 months ago when my dad retired my mom also decided to retire and that we’d be moving to Illinois (from Arizona) at the end of next month. I do not want to move with them as my plans for after college revolve around staying in Arizona,(not to mention how hard switching colleges this late would be) and all my friends are here I cannot mentally handle having my whole life uprooted and moved to a town 1600 miles away with nothing to do.

My job offers housing for $200 a month since we are in the middle of nowhere’s and I want to get one of those houses but I’m not sure how to bring it up to my parents because I’m terrified of thier reaction. I don’t think they would kick me out but I’m worried about being yelled at or guilted into staying with them."
"For around 5 years now both my parents have been what I think is abusing me.   


My mum uses her severe migraines to get away with anything and everything. Like recently I started doing wordle and she used her migraines as an excuse when she texts me the word.

My dad is actually abusing me though.

I can't say how many fucking times he's said fuck my life when I ask for help and he swears at me constantly. Whenever I find a way to do something not the ordinary way but I like it more and it won't affect my dad he stands up and shouts at me aggressively to do it his way. He also conventionly need me to do something every time I want to go out. He finds the need to always be in control and often only seems happy when I'm not the one smiling after he berates me. He always says how much he loves me but never shows it. And after all this he gives a lousy apology on text and forgets it. 

I have never stood up to my parents and I'm really on my breaking point and I'm scared they'll physically hurt me if I do.

They also both find it funny when they make fun of me and make my siblings play along and make fun of eachother. They decided to fatshame me today when I'm 4.5 kg under obese. My mum hates it when I make fun of her or anyone does.

At this point I've had hundreds of suicidal thoughts and tried it countless times but always reassure myself it will get better but will it?

I don't know what to do please help

"My mom has been abusive for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories was being thrown against the wall by my hair as a toddler. She used excessive force to punish me; often times I was just exhibiting the normal developmental behavior that comes with each age group. In middle school, I had head lice for 2 years straight, and she often made me cry. I didn’t know why mom was so mean. She would use threats to kill me to keep me in line often getting into my face, pointing her finger, screaming. As a teenager, whenever I spoke out against how she treated me or did anything she didn’t like, she would hit me. It became a daily thing for her to hit me—so much, that when I drove w her as an adult, I flinched when she made a rapid movement. She once slapped my face and strangled me. My mom distorts truth and one time as a teen when she was going to attack me, I was literally begging for her not to hit me. “Please mom, don’t. Stop!” I was in a sitting position on the couch, and as she lunged at me, I pushed her off of me with my feet. I got in sever trouble with this “wait until I get your dad you little bitch.” More violence from him. To this day, she tells people I kicked her in the stomach. I’m emotional now even thinking about this. 

My mental health hasn’t been good as an adult. My closest family members never got me into treatment when I tried to kill myself as a teen and young adult. It escalated and led to some really difficult times//instability. I always sought counseling, and have even been in programs, but I actually needed acute care. No one intervened as I struggled and my mental health deteriorated to point where I was hearing voices,extremely paranoid, struggling with alcohol addiction, and was in v unsafe environments that led to more undue trauma.

The only person who did assist of any sort, was my mother. God bless.

It’s just really hard, because she was and still is emotionally abusive. I think now she knows she can’t assault me anymore, but she still yells at me, calls me names, and gaslights me daily. Any attempts at discussing this are futile and usually leads to further screams, regardless of how I approach the topic. She has said that she apologizes for how she was when I was younger, and she’s trying to be a better person; I just don’t see the work she’s doing.

Again, the only saving grace between us, is that she has helped me when I needed picking up after some pretty hard falls. Her love language is acts of service, and I know she loves me.

Thanks if you made it this far. 

Im back to living with her, and am seeking ways to get out again. It’s only been 4.5 months, but I’ve had suicidal ideations and have driven myself mad with how much I’m gaslighted. Questioning what’s real.

She wants me to go out to eat with her on Mothers Day, but I told her I’m busy. It just takes so much out of me to hang out with her, agree with her lies, and pretend that I like her. 

I’m feeling bad about this. Am curious what your thoughts are, and how you think I should proceed. Thanks!"
"If you’re being assaulted by abusive parents, don’t call the police. They likely won’t do anything. They might even take your parents side and try to admit you to a psych hospital out of nowhere. The cops are notorious for not doing anything during domestic incidents and studies have shown that many of them are also domestic abusers. They’re notorious for not reporting to Child Protective Services when they’re supposed to be mandated reporters. Call CPS. CPS is a different entity and they are in charge of investigating child abuse. I spent my entire childhood calling the cops and they did nothing. I wish I had known to call CPS instead."
"I love me mom and dad but my dad is a big sarcastic being not a human at all what must I do I can’t help such dads at all he mocks me in public regarding my mobile addiction and I can’t help it and I don’t know what to even do about this i wish I was never born in this country and all children deserve parents but all parents don’t deserve children, why did they decide to have me they would have adopted a child still I am pissed off guys !!!! 
We were in a crowded place when he mocked me by calling me a kid who lost his virginity through the phone even in a luxury hotel he mocked me I got really angry what can I do guys please help me to decide what to do please give me a suggestion what I can do in these circumstances 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"As I talked to my childhood friend and my new friend and we all three have in common that we have abusive mothers we had to cut contact with. I wondered if there was a sub for abusive parents. And so I found my way in here. 

I realized knowing this sub exists with thousands of people who has similar experiences as us, helps me feel that I'm not alone and there's a safety in that. It can't be denied or gaslighted away as easy when I'm reminded that there's others with mothers or fathers who are abusive. I think it's healing to be a part of this sub.

My mom was the last one I wanted to admit was abusive. I shared all other traumas but the part about her I kept locked away in a secret box until I was around 23. I don't know why it was so hard to admit she wasn't who I made her up to be. Maybe because it would feel like my whole childhood was a lie. A shitty hurtful lie. And I would lose my parent, the core parent figure attached to my identity. 

My whole life I tried to be the daughter that would make my mom love me and be normal to me. I assumed I needed to help her. But it was pointless. She didn't let me near her, and she hated therapists. To this day I have still never heard her say what happened to her that made her this way. All I remember is her saying ""Why should I share my secrets to anyone? That's my business"" and that was it. 

Seeing her happy, smiling, and present, was like discovering a rare new bird in the sky. 99% of my memories of her, she's mad or distant. I dreamt about her as an alive doll several times. She is alive yet not. That's my image of her. And it creeps me out to this day still.

"My dad has been contacting me lately. SAed me, physically abused my mom a lot growing up. I was naive and didn’t tell the authorities earlier and went along with how my mom handled things. My mom is now elderly, out of it mentally and checked out and she was ashamed and wanted to stay hidden about it. I see now he likes to target “down on their luck” women or women with something to lose (like their job as a nurse for instance). He enjoys making women feel bad, shaming them and asserting his sense of dominance and “winning”. 

My dad wants my naive mom’s nursing pension and made it clear he felt he deserved it having been married to her (since he feels women do this to men therefore he thinks he deserves it and he takes no blame for abusing her badly many times). and he’s trying to use my brother to get to my mom and access what he feels should have been his (since she divorced him). 

Since Mother’s Day is coming up and he knew I was going to visit I think is why he called me privately yesterday to stress me out. He made sure to insult me, belittle me, slut shame me, etc. Of course, never taking responsibility for bad things he’s done and blaming how I’m “just like my mom” whom he loathes. He hates my mom and blames her for everything in his life and takes it out on me whenever possible. 

My dad has been a predator to women for years now. He owns a home in California and rents out rooms usually to women that are struggling. Then he will manipulate them, gaslight them And try to do whatever he can to them. He also goes on dating sites and tries to find women to become his “sugar mama” in addition to using his cute sweet dog and his business to gain credibility and access to women. 

Recently, he sent me an unsolicited (obviously) nude photo in his yard casually acting like it’s a joke. He’s always been allowed to say and do whatever he pleases and use fear and shame to control others.

I randomly thought to look at his business Yelp and Google and saw he has almost all good professional (construction job) reviews. Also, I want him to be known as a predator but I don’t necessarily want to put my name on it as he will attack me and he lives close to my mother so it can be a risk.  I live about 6 hours away but I can see him just trying to get me somehow. 

Anyone have any experience with this? "
"Has anyone successfully punished them? My father SA’d me as a kid and effectively gas lit me for years. He also was physically abusive to mom, etc then had audacity to shame me, etc. 

Now that I’m way older and going through changes I see just how messed up it all is how he chose to wield his power. He lives life on easy street with money he bamboozled from my pick me male validation obsessed mother, his nice house, his bikes, his good reviews on yelp for his contractor business. 

He hardly knows anything about me because I moved far away and keep distance but today has been telling me Im “miserable like my mom” ( so she has miserable when he was abusing her? Shocker?) and I just think he doesn’t deserve his life. 

I would love to turn him in but statute of limitations and he’s an absolute lying kiss ass who would do anything to save his own ass. He is a man who takes advantage of down on their luck women and had a few female roomies to pay him in his home. One of these women he got weird with and she “attacked him” (im positive he instigated it) and he turned it around on her and played up that he was an innocent senior citizen to the police. He’s absolutely insidious with no morals.

Anyone have any experience with this? With getting people like this back? It’s also a matter of what if he in his boredom and need for drama causes me issues?"
"I(20M) have grown up with a family that was extremely strict. My dad, has always had this get off your ass and do nothing but work mentality. A few months ago I was jobless but was working for myself and I had just gotten into a relationship. My dad and I were constantly fighting because he said if I expected to live in his house I oughta work. I agree, and I did. He came home to a clean home, I kept up with the chores, I made cash on the side, yet nothing has ever been enough for him. Fucking ever. Well long story short he cost me my relationship by talking shit about me to my gf’s dad about all my little quirks and insecurities and it made them both hate me and think I was using her, leading to tension between her and I bc she couldn’t tell what was truth and lies so I lost that relationship.  Since then I’ve not really talked to him much. But I got a job that pays damn near more than he makes in a year a month ago and I have been pulling my weight and minding my own business. Well I come home this morning from my 12 hour long night shift thinking I’m gonna shower and relax and try to change my sleep pattern to get ready for days next week, so imma play some video games. Well I log on to my pc after downloading PGA 2k23 last night to play on the new tv I purchased, only to find out my dad locked out my pc from the WiFi remotely so he could “do his work” last night. AKA doing his little DIY shit or some other project he concocted bc his work is not remote. I called him and went off on him because he literally told me to download my shit at night time which is what I did and he still fucking turned it off. Like the one fucking thing I wanted to do after my stressful week was play some fucking video games and I can’t even do that. Let’s not even mention he cut my hot water bc “I use too much and he can’t take his baths”. He said and I quote “since you have no respect for me and what I do I can leave it off” FUCK YOU, selfish prick. You cost me my relationship, you cost me my childhood, you cost me any sense of being normal bc of hiding me under a rock my whole life and now that I’m finally doing the things you always bitched about wanting me to do you’re still gonna pull this shit? Why not call me and ask what my pc pin is so you can pause my steam download instead of barring me from the internet until your midlife crisis ass finally remembers to turn it back on? If you want respect from me then fucking show it yourself. Treat me like you actually wanted me rather than I’m just a fuck trophy and here to carry on your good legacy. I’m tempted to end it I’m tired of this crap. The internet thing is a drop in the bucket but it was enough to make the dam break. I thought at 20 years old being grounded was a thing of the past. I work my ass off and I leave you alone and I pull my weight. Fuck I even buy my own food at this point. I guess I’m still just an immature child who deserves nothing and has no rights to anything bc he chose to live at home with his family rather than be alone. Fuck me right."
Is it normal if ur step dad smacks ur butt as a minor ? Or unclip ur bra just for fun ? Like is this considered as abuse ? 
"I'm... having to seriously confront putting my wish to cut mine off from my life as soon as I can get away into actuality. 

I'm not sure how to feel. I know the abuse inflicted on me is real and it's hurt me deeply but since they never took me seriously, never learned, never empathized, they'll be devastated. Angry, scared, suicidal, it could wreck them. 

I tried so hard for them. I gave up half of my life just to keep everything together. 

And I love them, or somewhere in me I still wish I did. I can't feel comfort in them anymore. I can't give them my love. But somewhere I wish I still could. 

And it's so scary to think about how everything will happen. So scary to try to line it all up properly so I won't have to go homeless, and won't get abused more, won't be gaslit into feeling like a horrible person for leaving after all these years, all I ever did was stay by their side.

I need to leave. I want to burn my bridges. But I'm scared it might be a big mistake. I'm terrified of it all.

Survivors of an abusive family, please, tell me how you felt after you took the plunge? Please tell me the anxiety stops. The hyper vigilance. The guilt. Oh god, so much fucking guilt it hurts so badly. 

Please tell me it's going to be okay "
">Posting this here because I can't find my normal abusive parents subreddit, I guess I'm too messed up to remember the name. So if you see this post twice, I apologize.<

I don't know why I still try with my mom. It hurts so bad every time. I feel like I get so close to a working relationship with her, and always, every time, she does something or says something that is so cruel and unfeeling that I question why I ever tried to mend the relationship in the first place.

Take 10 minutes ago. I am in town for my grandmother's funeral. Normally I am very far from their southern American town, and I limit communication to only a few texts per week, if that. I usually stop texting when the pro-Trump conspiracies or pro-Israel rants come out. Btw, all Palestinians are basically Hamas! Did you know? Because I didn't! Lol. It's nuts. Oh and the students protesting at Columbia University (I live in NYC) they are antisemites determined to not let Jewish students get into any buildings, it's nuts(I know several people currently protesting. I'm in the protest chats on Lex. It's confirmed that about a 3rd of those protesters are members of the Jewish Student Union, fyi.)

So they're kind of nuts. I have been conditioned to look past this.

Anyways. 10 minutes ago. I put on 80’s music while I made dinner with my mom, so I could drown out some depression thoughts I've been having whilst here. I have been pretty emotionally shut down for the past 4 days of being here, so as to not let myself get hurt. I feel like a zombie. Every time I have to be around them the thoughts come back. Anyways. The 80’s music always puts my mom in a good mood and has her dancing. So I think, maybe, since she's in a good mood, maybe I can talk about setting a boundary with her.

To set up the boundary, I am a skilled singer. I have been since I was 4. And since I was 4, my parents really enjoyed “showponying” me: having me sing for their friends and strangers wherever we went. At every party. Restaurants. Gatherings. You name it. They were so proud of me, and they want to show off those voice lessons that they paid for.

Obviously, when I entered my incredibly emotional puberty era, it became all too much. I begged them to stop. I would get so embarrassed when they asked me to sing, that I would have to find a bathroom and cry and hide for hours. I would tell them I couldn't handle it right now. I was going through a lot – “friends” bullying me, horrible menses, a fun little eating disorder. “You're being selfish, we paid for those voice lessons, you better show them off!!!” That was painful to hear. It's still painful to hear till this day, because my mother will never drop it. I'm 30 now and she can't let it go.

(Btw, this is a small event out of hundreds of larger, more hurtful events. Physically hurtful events.)

So we're singing. Well, I'm fake singing and she knows it. I'm just trying to show that I am enjoying the moment so she doesn't make a comment like “if you're going to be so depressed around us then why come at all?” She starts trying some high notes, and asks me to teach her. I freeze up, that emotional PTSD hitting me in the damn face. I REALLY want to hide in the hallway bathroom. I try to work through it and “teach” her. She says “show me!” And I ignore it. No more singing from me.

We finish dinner, eat with my Dad, and all are still in a relatively good mood, thank God. My dad and I are talking while my mom is distracted, and I actually think we had a constructive conversation where I set a real (unrelated)boundary. My dad is a much better listener than my mom. So I've built up some confidence.

My mom is singing a little while playing her phone game. I am cleaning up the table, and I tell her, “You know I would love to sing with you if you weren't weird about it, I actually love to sing” (bad choice of words) 

Mom: “What! When have I ever been weird about you singing”

Me: “Do you know what showponying is?” (Btw I have defined showpony for her about once a year. To be fair it's not commonly used in this way, unless you're an improviser. The real phrase that I want to say is that she “pimps me out” but she would be very distracted by the use of the ‘curse word’, “pimp”.)

Mom: “No, did you make that word up?” 

Me: “Well it's when you ask someone to do something, like sing, for others, just for your own enjoyment, without caring whether the singer wants to or not”

Mom: “oh my GOSH, STOP!! WHEN have I ever done that to you!!!!”

Me: “Yesterday (at a family gathering), the day before(a different but similar family gathering), and also the day before that(when I was trying to practice privately for a song I was singing at my grandmother's funeral). I really don't like it and it hurts my feelings. If you promised to stop I would sing with you whenever you want! I'd be happy to”

Mom: (shuts down at this suggestion) “I do not do that to you ever. Of course you can turn any conversation negative. I'm done talking, leave me alone so I can play my game. I'm tired and I don't want to deal with that nonsense right now”

I want to push back so bad. I know it's hopeless.

Me: “Well, I'm just trying to set a boundary with you so we can have a better relationship…”

Mom: “Just stop. I can't handle your negativity.”

Me: “well I'm sorry, but actually you were the one who made it negative, I was just trying to solve a problem...”

She walks away. 

I'm so messed up now. I'm a 30 year old grown ass woman and I am on the floor of our hallway bathroom just bawling my eyes out. Why do I try?? Why do I think things will change???? 

Because I have hope that I can one day have a relationship with them. I'm so jealous of my best friend, who tells her mom everything. I just wish I had that. 

It's stupid and I know I have to stop, but I also know that I'm addicted to trying at this point. Is anyone else here still trying? Can anyone relate? Or is it just too foolish.

"(Trigger warning)

My mother and father are very abusive in every way and social services are now involved but i want to see if this was abuse or not before i tell my social worker. 

When i was younger my father used to shower me. Now this may have been normal if your daughter was between 4-8 but it only stopped when i was 11-12. My friend said thats already a red flag. My memories of this are really fuzzy but i remember he used to take a really long time cleaning and drying between those “certain parts.” However, apparently i kept wanting him to wash me and dry me. I believe that to be somewhat true. However, my father all that time said he was so disappointed in me growing up and how he’ll miss his time doing this with me once i grow older and how it’s not ever going to be the same with me “leaving” him, and i didnt want him to not “love” me anymore, so i kept allowing him to do it and kept asking was he going to want to give me a “shower”

My father has in the past climbed into bed with me while im asleep to try to “cuddle” with me, and has grabbed my breasts and has also tried to kiss me, so he has a history of doing things he shouldn’t.

Basically, is this my fault or was i being assaulted by my father?

"“Stop being so sensitive”

"My Father is 55, he shouts, berates and mocks everyone, he is not all bad or anything, he abuses the dog Misthi too, and he apologizes over and over again, never changes himself, a part of me wishes to be an abusive parent like him too but worse, i am from India, i am 20 years old and a male, his second of two sons, my older brother and my dad never get along either, i inherited his abusive nature and often kick, head butt, elbow, punch and neglect the dog too. 

  
He is a Control Freak and Over Scared off my Well Being at the same time, and he is a drunk too at times, i inherited drinking from him, but i decided to quit drinking as i once left the dog outside the house and locked her because i was drunk and didnt want to walk her, she would not get kidnapped or anything but she could have been hurt or something, given how Indians drive.

"I needed to vent. 

Mum didn’t make breakfast for me in the mornings n I used to faint at school. She’d let me go to school with eye boogers. My classmates had to tell me I need to remove them in the mornings. She gave me money to buy fried food at the cafeteria sometimes. My grandfather scolded my parents to take better care of me and due to societal pressure she encouraged me to eat more junk food so that I’d stop being skinny. After I hit puberty she’d make me feel bad if I was starting to gain weight.

I’m still struggling.. I keep thinking I won’t get to get that good I liked ever again as it’ll be taken away from me and someone will restrict me. I’m feeling so messed up. "
"I’m helping a family member try to sort through some memories of abuse from when they were a child. Some of their memories took place at Wayfarers Chapel likely around the late 50s early 60s in Palos Verdes. I’m wondering if anyone else from the area knows anyone that might have suffered abuse there, even if it’s a rumor?"
"So When I (F,25) turned 15 I became pretty depressed. I've never really known why as up to that point my life was pretty smooth sailing, nothing traumatic. My parents split up a few years before and dad moved out but  they continued to talk and coparent.

Anyway at 15 I was depressed. I didn't want to get up out of bed. Couldn't face going to school and honestly just wanted the world to stop but at that age I couldn't verbalise it.

I guess my parents didn't understand and just thought I was being lazy. The first few months it was just my mum. there was a lot of shouting at me to get up and threats of taking things away (like toys/objects that I loved ect)  if i didnt get to school. Telling me that she was disappointed. That would I do reflects badly on my siblings and on her. 

Then it turned physical first just dragging me out of bed (I had a cabin bed so I got pulled down from that and it would leave marks from when I would hit my back on the steps) then came the hitting. My mum would scream and I would just completely shut down and because I couldn't answer (I guess she thought I just wasn't answering her on purpose) the hits came. A few slaps on the cheek. A few hits to the arms. Then she would throw things at me, pretty much anything she had in reach in my bedroom, shoes, Action figures.

I was already struggling with school before all this and then as this was happening my grades slipped more (be that from the depression or the screaming and hitting)

I got pulled in to the head of years office and asked if everything was OK at home and it was like I knew I could say ""no my mums been hitting me"" yet I couldn't say that. All I could say was yeah everything's fine. Because I knew if I said anything the school would have to look into it and they could not just take me away but my siblings and they didn't deserve to lose thier mum because of me

My dad then moved back in. Told me it was because my mum didn't know how to handle me anymore. That she was struggling to handle me and look after my siblings

I actually thought that maybe I wouldn't spend every morning being screamed at and hit when he moved back in. But I was wrong about 1 of those. My dad never hit but the shouting didn't stop. He pinned me against the wall one time and told me if I didn't start behaving and doing what I was asked then I could pack my bags and leave.

When I finally left school and got a job and paid money towards the household it all just stopped. The shouting, the hitting.

I guess in my head I rationalised it to I made them angry with all my defiance and it wasn't their fault they didn't know I was depressed.

Then my younger sister started doing the same thing. Sleeping in, refusing to get up and go to school and I thought oh god they're going to shout and hit her too but they didn't. They never raised their voice once, never once raised a finger towards her. She was met with compassion and understanding.

I remember asking once why they shouted at me but not her and got scoffed at and told you were trying to wind us up and your sister is ill.

Im 25 now. My older sibling was talking about when we were school the other day and was like ""remember when mum used to have to drag you out of bed. God she would scream"" laughing. My parents were there too laughing saying ""those were the days"" and I just sat there thinking am I crazy. Am I the only one that remembers everything that happened.

The thing is in my head I know it was abuse of some kind, be it physical, emotional.
Yet they've never done it since, they don't talk about, never apologised for it. Its like everyone moved on and it was just a blip.

I can't talk to my siblings about any of it because i know they won't understand. I was the only one that went through it. Its like we didn't have the same parents. 
I don't really know if I can bring it up with my parents. Call it abuse to their face.

Anyway just needed a space to get it off my chest as it's been running through my head the last couple of days."
"I have been suffering by the hands of my parents since I was a child, I am 25 now and it is still happening to this day...

No matter how much I point it out to them, they still can't see it! They keep throwing bitch-fits and I am honestly so heartbroken because of all this. They are the ones that are supposed to understand me the most, right?

I don't have any friends or a partner and I feel so alone in all of this, it is just me against the world 😭

I feel like nothing."
"How is it possible I didn't figure out they were emotionally abusive until I turned 40?! I knew I dealt with extreme parentification, but explained it by ""we didn't know it was wrong then"". But she's still being toxic and manipulative to this day, and is so intertwined in my life that I have no idea how to cut her off. 

I'm usually so self aware, but this hit me out of nowhere.

Does anyone know what I need to look for in a therapist or life coach? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple of days and want to go in prepared. (ADHD, unrelated to this)"

hi. this is my first time posting a reddit so no clue what i’m doing. i’m 23 M and my father is really abusive. i’m away at medical school but that is due to finish in two months, the plan is to move home but i’m having second thoughts about it. 

my father has been violent towards my mother and both my sisters. he was been violent towards me, put me in A&E during my sixth form days, emotionally manipulative, blackmails etc you name it he does it. my mum wouldn’t have a divorce because im from a traditional indian family. 

i decided to make a post today because im at home for the weekend and my dad attempted to kick me out the house, so i was gonna just drive back to university. but then he took my car keys and then now i can’t leave, this all happened at 2am. I’m really exhausted from the years of abuse, and the thought of being home permanently scares me. 

my older sister felt the same and she recently moved out and moved abroad to get away from all the abuse. my other sister who is older stays at home, and her health and mental health deteriorates. my mother has been depressed since the day i have met her. she has no hobbies, no friends, doesn’t go out she is just broken inside and out. I’ve spent years trying to help my mum but it leads no where. 

i’m at the point now where i can’t sleep for months, PTSD, cry out of no where, get triggered all the time, i shake when he is near me, my body shakes a lot more when he touches me. my mother always told me when i was a kid, like 6/7, that when i get older he will get better…. he hasn’t. it’s just gotten a lot worse. I thought when i would be older and a graduate, blooooody medical school, he would be better. but he isn’t…… 

I know I should move out but the reason i don’t want to is because of money. i won’t be able to save & i grew up poor. the thought of spending money on rent scares me. but then maybe i should because of the mental health benefits?  

Just want to know people’s thoughts about my situation. "

"im going to go crazy. i literally dont know what to do. ive been staying with my grandparents because both of my parents are abusive mentally insane fent abusers. today we went back to the house to clean up their mess so we can kick them out that house but it went horribly wrong. my dad, went insane and started hitting my grandpa and he was bleeding so i was trying to break it up like putting my arm around my dads throat to push him back because my grandpa is getting really old and he can literally die. my dad runs out the house and goes into my grandpas car to try and run away but my grandpa literally hangs on the hood of the car nearly getting ran over. my neighbor saw all of this happening so she was calling the police. let me just put a backstory of me and my dads relationship. me and him HATE each other so much. once he beat me with a metal rod (few months ago) and threw a brick at me, he mentally abuses me like calling me a jin (hes muslim) and all this stupid stuff. he sold my bed for coca\*ne and both of the tvs in the house. anyway, he starts saying stupid hyprocrite shit and i tell him to shut up and he beats me on the sidewalk. (im 14 btw and hes 41) enough ab my dad tho my mom is pathological liar that sells her body for men. she LIES about everything i cant even say an example bc theres so many. my dad and mom have a bipolar relationship like theyll love each other then they will try and kill each other. (he put a knife to my moms neck while she fell on my lap) but ya guys i have no one to tell so im js trauma dumping on the  internet"
i remember when my abusive parents used to beat me full on naked in the bathroom and they would like block the doors so i cant escape so i would be cornered in lmao it just came to my head it makes me so sad
"Growing up in a family where physical abuse is normal and ""keeping womens under the men's feet is common"" and they justify this attitude as religious. Now I'm 20 years old and I've to hear a lots of stuff such as I'm worthless, no one needs a daughter luke me, why I don't commit su***de like others and some times physical abuse. After all this I still tried to be a good daughter to my parents but that never happened my sister who is 10 years younger than me she is always the best and if she make a mistake that's my fault cause as an elder sister I never taught her I stopped talking to my younger sister but still it's my fault. To my mom my cousin are best as daugter and I'm a failure.
Is there any problem with me. To avoid those situations I almost locked my self in the room and now I'm thinking I should commit su**de."

"My close friend (in high school, under 18m, let's call him Christopher) has been abused by his stepdad. Ever since his mother has been married to him(let's call him Tony) it has been hell for my friend, his sister(in same high school), and other siblings. Christopher has told me about how many chores he has to do everyday, and he doesn't even have a phone, which I found a little crazy. He has to do outdoor chores in the morning before school, has to wash dishes after-school, clean, do a little cooking, do his homework, take out the trash, and through it all he's constantly yelled at and gets very little time to play. I just thought his parents just seemed to give out more chores than normal but a couple months ago it got worse. Tony demanded that at the end of each month, Christopher must pay him $20. Tony calls it “rent.” Christopher isn't like me, where I get an allowance, thus his only form of income is gifts, birthday, and Christmas. He needed to do some odd jobs, like using his brain(he’s in top 10 btw) to do people's homework for money and he has been able to scrape by with help from me and his other friends. It got worse as now when he cleans around the house he finds things labeled “king” which means it is Tony's stuff. I fear it is going to get worse and worse by the day, making him do more things than a high school student can possibly do. His sister is grounded for a very long time, not being able to leave the house, no phone, and not having many things teens have nowadays because she actually sued her parents but failed in court. I help Christopher and follow the things I have been told to do, such as telling him I'm with him no matter what and giving him money. This has gone too far and I wonder what is the next step in helping my friend?"
"cuz like i get calling ur kid a bitch unwarranted is bad but if i am being a bitch, or worthless or a disgrace and i know my mom will call me those things then at that point its on me right? i lowkey deserve it at that point. also is it abuse to say ""you deserve to be beat"" if she said it only once? or when i expressed suicidal thoughts once she told me to get on with it? other than these things my mom is fine considering the pain she herself goes through with scoliosis. like maybe im a bad daughter? she always tells me i dont do anything around the house and i tell her to give me a list of chores because she never has, and she tells me to offer to do chores but when i do she says no.but then she says i never offer? sorry im rambling now my point is, is she abusive at all? or is it my fault?

my dads birthday was this wednesday and I gave him a candle my mom bought for me and a store bought card. (im 13 i dont have any money rn) he is yelling at me and is saying i suck at everything and makes his life worse
"im honestly shocked. so my mom and dad have been arguing again - nothing new. they used to be a lot worse and i would ALWAYS involve myself, i would always try to come to the rescue for my mom and she would always tell me not to involve myself. i used to absolutely hate my dad and my mom would tell me ""he is still your dad"" - i would basically fight my moms battles and for years i have always tried to be the ""peacemaker"" or the ""mediator"" - i am also the eldest by the way .. however i realized it was truly never my battle to fight. i am just their child and they are the adults who should know better. 

so, recently my mom has developed a pattern. whenever her and my dad are on bad terms, suddenly my siblings and i are the worst people on earth too. 

she randomly started talking about how she is treated so badly and that others (being me and my siblings?) see and do nothing ... she said ""and they are just as guilty, you are actually an accomplice"" ... ??? i was so shocked ... how can you call your child an accomplice in something they have no control over .. and also keeping in mind that she was the SAME person who said we shouldnt pick sides and that my dad is still my dad .. it seems that she doesnt like my relationship with my dad - she always tries to make me feel guilty over things that have nothing to do with me/i have no control over.

There has been many fights between me and my parents about move out. I kept asking for months, ""hey how are we going to move out?"", and then they just ignored me. They also kept telling me they would figure it out. I even tried to plan out a really good way to move out, and I already had everything in motion, but they called and cancelled all of it. Fast forward until two days until move out and they send me a condescending text saying that because of my poor planing, I need to sell all my stuff and get rid of my pet to move out. I of course told them there was no damn way I would eve do that and reminded them that I kept telling them we needed to plan for move out. They just kept insisting that I have to get rid of my pet. For context behind this next but, my dad was involved in a really bad divorce between him and his ex wife. During that, he quite literally through me in the middle and let his ex steal my identity and cancel all financial aid I had and ruin my credit score. He also let his ex take EVERYTHING I had and hold it for ransom. I know this probably sounds overdramatic, but when I say I have nothing, I have NOTHING. I told him that my pet was the ONE thing I had left on this planet, then one thing that cared for me. This went on back and forth for a while until he sent me a final text. 

In it, he basically explained that I've always been a burden to him and that I have NEVER sacrificed anything for him. He said I was extremely selfish and he would move me out this summer, but the would not be taking me for any breaks over next school year. He also said he would be taking my pet and would not let me have it back over the fall. He then blocked me.

Today when my mom picked me up, it was a even bigger shit show. She kept implying she may not show up and that she was well within her rights to not show up. She kept texting me demanding I apologize or else she'll leave me homeless, causing me to get really stressed and to Self-H again to try and dull out the stress and pain from the situation. I told her that I tried to plan something out before but they canceled that plan. I also tried to call my grandmother for help, and she just told me I should be more considerate of my mom's feelings, and that once again I've never had to loose anything before (she also knows I lost everything to my dad's ex). My mom then threw in a bunch of threats and told me to be prepared to jump in the car and leave as fast as possible (which I was fine with). When she arrived she shut off the AC and told me I didn't get those privileges any more. She then rolled down all the back windows where I was sitting and turned the radio to it's highest setting playing the loudest songs possible; keep in mind this wasn't a short drive. So for 6 hours on the interstate we drove with windows down and radios blasting. I tried to nap, and I kid you not she swerved the car near a ditch and turned around when I shot up and said, ""You do NOT get to sleep because you made me drive all the way out here"". I know if I tried to go back to sleep or talk back she would actually drive us into that ditch. 

I'm worried being back at the house, it's going to be an all out crap show. I'm always a scape goat and I know that they will find every little thing to blame me for. I also suffer from pretty bad depression and I'm worried it may drive me into doing something not good, it's already caused me to heavily think about it. I know the wise thing to do is to not stay and leave the house, but I have no friends or other family. If I leave I will be homeless with no money to my name after the court case. I just don't know what to do and I really don't think I can survive the whole summer if this is already where we are at."

"I was wondering if anyone else who had an abusive childhood is experiencing some of the symptoms I am. I have symptoms of fibromyalgia and joint pain. Also my glutes are really really sore to the touch. It feels like bee stings. 

I used to get beat as a child as a form of punishment and it just would turn to violence. The bee stings when I touch my glutes or when my husband touches my glutes reminds me of the same feeling I used to feel when getting beat. My whole body used to be sore to the touch and achy but now it’s getting better.  My glutes are horrible though!

Anyone else experiencing this?"
"My parent prided themself on neber physically abusing me. Well, i finally snapped (this man is disgusting, screaming at random children, telling me to shut up about my suicidal/homicidal ideations, calling me a tramp at 13 years old then inappropriately looking at my body and commenting on it, and that's the few things off the top of my head.) 

But he never physically assaulted me. 
Until today. He came in all pissy, and I tried to apologise. 
I don't remember most of the event because I was having a panic attack and trying to calm down, bur i snapped on him (he brought up my alcoholism in a very pathetic way because I asked him to take a step back) 
(I'm getting help for my alcohol abuse) 

But I started going off about everything.  Screaming and sobbing that he hasn't loved or even respected me for ages, and he plays ignorant to me all the time. 

He put his hands on my face / head and grabbed. 
This has set back several assault traumas by years. 

I remember screaming at him ""how fucking dare you?"" 
And his response was to simply laugh and say ""excuse you? What did you say to me? You've done the same thing to me thousands of times."" 

(I haven't,  but i vaguely resemble my mother who could be abusive. He uses this to excuse his sexualisation of me). 

I just... ""Everything but-"" isn't a good thing in abuse. It's a threat. And today my dad broke his promise that he'd never put hands on me.  

Fat fuck will die a lonely pervert. 
I do not have a ""dad"". 

I do have the privilege of my chosen family though 😍🥰
"
My father has been abusive to my mom and my brother  since forever. My brother moved out a few years ago and recently he has been physically and verbally abusive to me whenever i try to protect my mother from being beaten and abused. I cant seem to forgive him no matter what. This morning he was admitted to the hospital and turns out his condition is severe but i dont feel the least bit of sympathy for him. Although i feel a little guilty for not being sympathetic towards him today but i dont know if its alright to not forgive him for all the torture and trauma he has passed on to me. Can somebody pls tell me whats wrong and whats right?
"I hate my mum and I can’t wait until I have enough money to move you. 

(Sorry if grammar is bad, I’m writing this at work) (and sorry it’s so long) 

Disclaimer, I know I don’t have it nearly as bad as some people but I’m just frustrated 

I’m an 18yr old female and my mum is the most insufferable person I’ve ever met, she wasn’t always like this… in fact we were quite close when I was little, but as I’ve grown older I feel like she’s trying to control me and hates that I’m independent so she’s horrible to me? 

The breaking point was today when I was sitting down doing school work (I’m in uni study a very intensive double degree) she comes up to me and says “is it too much to ask you to go to the grocery shop” I explain to her I’m doing work and she tells me to go in 30 minutes then I explain to her that I’m doing a timed assessment that is due today and opened today so I need to do it and can’t stop because I’ll run out of time so she’s scoffed at me and goes “I used to go to the shop for you as a kid, why do I even bother with you” so while she was in the shower I go talk to my dad about how she’s being to me and she swings the door to my dads office open and says to me “bitching today about me?” Then proceeds to tell me I should of just gone to the shop and not been such a brat. 

When I was younger one of my most memorable things is that when I was (maybe 8-14?) she would force me to pull down my pants and show her my vagina, and because it didn’t look like hers (I was obviously still growing and barley hit pubity) she would always laugh and tell me it wasn’t normal. 

Over the years I’ve wrote down in my notes stuff she’s done so I’ll list some here:

-  I was unpacking the groceries and I told her the drinks wouldn’t fit in the fridge and she replied yelling “OP don’t be an obnoxious brat!” 

- she asked me to buy her a juice after work so I did and I bring it to her and she yells at me saying she didn’t want it and then she called me selfish 

- she told me to clean out the fridge and I was, then she goes into the kitchen and slams the fridge door shut (it was open and I was in between the fridge and the door because I was cleaning) and I tell her she hit me and she immediately told me I was being a drama queen and took my phone off me, then called me a smart as 


- I got broken up with and was upset so I want to talk to her and she told me to go away because she was tired, so I went into the bathroom to shower and closed the door and she screamed “OP SLAM THAT DOOR AND ILL SLAME YOUR FACE INTO IT” (I didn’t slam it) 

- when I was 17 she found out I was r**** and refused to talk to me for a week because I wasn’t a virgin 

Other things she does include-

- calling me a selfish bitch or a cow 
- calling me fat and ugly 
-making fun of what I wear 

And if I tell her something isn’t right or I don’t like something she’s doing or ask her to apologise for anything she’ll say something like 

- learn how to take a joke 
- you’re no fun 
- guess I won’t talk anymore then 
- you’re too sensitive 
"
"My mom will always make ""jokes"" about me being a ""dummy"" or being ""stupid"" and I hate it. Today she called me braindead and stupid 3 times because apparently being cut off mid-sentence while explaining something makes me sound dumb (she's the one who cut me off)- this has been going on since I was a baby with her saying she regrets having me and that she should've never had a kid. It's so annoying and I hate it when she calls me names but she just won't stop no matter how much I tell her to. Should I talk to my school counselor?"
"I have 2 older sisters and we're 7/8 years apart and ik they've suffered too. But I just see brothers protecting their younger siblings and I'm so fucking jealous. I just wish they wouldve protected me from my dad hitting/screaming at me. But at the same time I was really bad to my younger sister. Like I remember my friend slapping her really hard, and when she told an adult I just said I didn't see anything. And that's not even the only thing but it's probably the worse. I probably traumatized her or at least definitely made her childhood worse. But I swear I really do regret it, I apologised and we have a good relationship now. But all of that just makes me think that I shouldn't want to be protected if I couldn't protect her yk. I wish I had someone to protect me and I really wish I protected my sister too and I'm just so sorry about not being there for her when she was a kid but I was a kid too. "
"I've posted a couple times other spots, but I'll post again here too. I'm looking for more advice. My parent will act confusing sometimes to me. One minute they will be asking how my day was, the next giving my little brother a nose bleed. Or one minute giving me a hug, the next picking me up by my shirt whilst pinned against the wall and yelling at me. It is annoying, weird, and puts me on edge. I am at the point where I am anxious randomly all the time. Even at school. People at school will make fun of me or laugh at me too which makes it even worse. I need some way to express these emotions, but I am isolated. I am afraid all the time. I have become much more numb to my emotions and find it even harder to form any bonds with people or care about them. My behavior has also becoming increasingly more aggressive. Recently I actually hit my brother with a belt because I was angry at him and he responded with attacking me using a hanger.
Help?"
i realy like walking around my room but my parrents tell me they will take my computer away (i need it for school) and i just dunno is this abusive?
"Hi everyone. 23F. 

I’ve been coming to terms with how abusive my family has been my whole life. This has not been helped since I’ve come out as transgender. My ultimate goal is to be able to cut my family off financially. 

I’m very lucky to be in the financial position I’m in. I’ll be graduating college in December, but until then, my dad is helping pay for half of my rent and groceries, and I am on his insurance. I’m a type 1 diabetic, so I can’t afford to lose the luxury of this assistance.

For anyone who’s ever been in a situation of financial dependence - how do you break away?"
"She had me in shape wear/girdles from 5th grade until high school. Like I was 9-10 years old and she was actively asking me ""where's your girdle?"" before I left the house, buying me waist trainers and giving me her old ones. Always talked about me dieting or being too big and only ever praised me when i lost weight quickly (usually during depressive episodes). I ( while in HS) once wore a pair of pajama pants that were extra fluffly around the house after I had dropped some weight and when I walked past her she said ""You gained all that weight back"" while just shaking her head and looking disappointed.  Although there was no way for her to know I was already feeling self conscious when she said it, there was still no reason to say it at all. I had just started to recover from my ED and that one comment made me lose my appetite for 3 days. 

I'm good now for the most part, but she called and asked what she ever did to make me avoid her and that was the main thing on the list she refused to believe and I didn't want to full on argue about it, but I didn't want to sit on it either. "
"Well i mostly iron their skin or burn them with my cigars, besides ofc regular beatings. Any other things i should do to them?"

right when she gets home all my mom does is yell at me. i cant deal with this. i feel so hopeless and miserable im sobbing right now i dont know what i did to deserve this 
"please dont say anything rude, I would like genuine advice. So I am F(23) and I am living with my ex M(24) after moving in with him into a home my parents  supposedly “bought” me. They own it, I have no lease, my parents who are millionaires, financially pay for my entire life, and control almost every aspect of my life (what job I can work, what I go to school for, and who I date and who I can bring to the house). I was emotionally and physically abused by them as a child, had distanced myself when I was 18 and moved out. last year they inherited millions and lured me back in with cheap rent in a huge house, promises to be kind to me, and when I did they threatened to evict me or call the police if I don’t do something they want me to do, especially if I don’t keep constant contact with them. My ex and I ended up getting really close to their friend group during this time. My ex who is extremely violent behind closed doors, and a compulsive liar, and serial cheater (hence why I am leaving him) but extremely charming to others, has convinced everyone that I am insane, or my parents have im not sure. My ex and parents have an extremely close relationship as well. they bought him a car, they financially support his life. I told my parents and ex I wanted to leave him and I wanted my ex to move out of the house they bought “ME” and my parents have cussed me out everyday since and even threaten to call the police to have me evicted from the home so that my ex can live there instead of me. They tell me I’m crazy and no one will ever love me except him. My ex has been hanging out with my parents friends well and the speaking about me constantly and they all came up with the conclusion I am having a nervous breakdown because it’s not rational to want to leave him I guess? When I try to explain my side, no one listens and they started sending me therapy links. I stopped hanging around them all, and my ex god to my family dinners without me. I started seeing another guy in hopes that my ex will leave the home on his own, and now he is just telling everyone we are not broken up and I am cheating on him. I went to the psychiatrist yesterday and she told me I’m not crazy and I’m acting exceptionally well despite the circumstances of what is going on. "
"why did they do all of that to me, did i really deserve all of that? im trying my best and im never good enough for them. im so desperate for validation that ill never get "
being forced to strip naked and being smacked on ur ass repeatedly? my mom would do this to me and take me to the basement so the neighbours wouldn't hear me scream for help and me begging her to stop 
"before i start writing i feel like i’m about to tell some sort of horror story because there’s just crazy amounts of stuff that happened but basically, when i was younger my mum re married and he physically abused me for years of my life till i was 10 and i was in hospital from a injury, it’s something i’ll never understand but i know how fucked up it is, what’s more fugged up is how my mum stayed married to him and never seemed to be there to defend child me and she’s still married to him? i was taken out of her custody after this event and eventually saw her again but when i was 13-14 she stopped contacting me, i later found out that she had a mental breakdown and also lost custody of my brother (that’s a whole different story), what has brought this up in my mind is that her husband the guy who hurt me is now starting to hurt her with his mental abuses and all sorts of narcisstic tactics, im now 21 and she has told me that she is going to leave him, after all these years of her trying to make me and him have a relationship again, this all sounds so fucked up right? because it is fucked up what i’m trying to get some sort of help with is what do i now, she’s coming to me trying to get me to help with her with legal stuff and honestly i have no sympathy anymore i half hate her and half don’t understand how you could be like this to me my whole life ??? i’m expecting my first child any day now and she wants in on everything but i’m just done with the toxic environment i grew up in, what would you do? my problem is i can’t cut people off for shit"
"Okay, so. I am 12 years old. Every time my mom wakes me up on the weekends, she always starts yelling at me for no reason and beats me up. Recently, my mom got mad at me for not drinking my medicine, so she punched my eye which almost popped it out. This has been going on my entire life. I sometimes feel like killing myself. Once, me and my mom went to do the laundry and I was packing our clothes and she got mad that I wasn't doing it fast enough and she beat me in public. Other people in the store told her to stop and they kicked her out the store. She got so mad that when i got home she beat me  until my butt was bleeding and I begged and she wouldn't stop. She finally stopped when her friend called her. Whenever i missed the bus (because my mom would chase me around the house with a hanger and beat me) she gets mad and blames me and doesn't take me to school that day and makes me put my hands up like a slave on the wall and if I don't she will beat me. She always cursed at me like when I talk for example: If i said something, she would tell me to shut the f\*\*\* up.  She always blames stuff that happens even if I didn't do it. She gets mad if i forget to close the bathroom door and slaps me. And whenever it's a school night, she doesn't even care if I sleep late or not. She forces me to stay up to help her clean her bowls which takes forever and if I complain she beats me. She even beat me when I was only 4 years old. I once was 4 and she gave me rice and some soup I didn't like so I told her I didn't want it so she beat me up with a stick until i begged for mercy and ate the whole thing. I sometimes pray to god to die because of how she treats me. "
"Hello everyone. I'll l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of what's up. 


I just need people's views on wether this is normal or not, or not that bad, or fucked up, or whatever. But I need either the dismissal for this not being ""that bad"" or validation so I don't feel guilty for how I feel. It's also weirdly empowering (instead of victimizing) when I acknowledge that the things I'm going to describe speak poorly of them and that I can see that. I dont feel like bringing this up to my friends. 


Before laying it out I'd like to get another thing off my chest: I feel like I'm misleading you because I'm not mentioning much of the stuff I did wrong. But I never put my family in danger, nothing close to that (that is the only reason for hitting someone that I could justify). But I was still made to feel like the things I did where very bad. Also feeling guilty because it's not the typical abusive household where I'm getting punished for no reason, it's a loving place. I'm aso conflicted because this person has a reputation as a very dependable friend and also he is not egotistical. But idk still this doesn't sit right with me. 


I'm 23. Family is from Eastern Europe, Soviet-ish culture. Immigrated to Argentina in 2000, that's when I was born. 



My life up until 7yo: I don't remember anything basically. So, all of this is what I've been told. Father lied a lot and was hysterical, when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes, my mother always put me in another room so I wouldn't witness that. When I was 1 I was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out, dad wanted me to stop, I didn't so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door. At some point during this period up until 7yo he said that i should ""fear him, like an animal"". He never laid a hand on me but had outbursts. When I'm 7 mom divorces him. 


So after that, I've always lived with my mom, grandparents and uncle (all maternal) up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place, visits weekly. 


Dad left the country 4 years later, when I was 11, and before that he'd pick me up 3/4 times a year. I'm told I wasn't really sad when he left. Btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me. Musicians are evil freemasons, the number 11 everywhere, that kinda thing. Once at like 10yo, in the shower, I broke down and called my mom to talk because I couldn't handle all the bad-mouthing that my father was talking about them (my family). I went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when I was 20 and luckily snapped out of it. 


So after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure. Which I guess was even more so when my actual father left the country. From this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which I feel have conditioned me, I'll share a few representative examples. 


We were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking I told him to ""shut up"" (in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up), the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheek/mouth from his part.


This was some months later I'm sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks. Uncle comes in says we are eating soon so don't eat any more chocolate. When he came back to call me to dinner he sees I ate all the chocolate, takes the water bottle and empties it on my head. It was at keast half full, because I remember even the matress soaking on the part I was sitting. He told me to stay there, so I couldn't change and even had to sleep on that matress. Idk how this would make you feel but for me it's a good example of the humiliation, anger, shame and whatnot that I felt with some frequency from his actions. Given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me, I always felt intimidated, afraid, so I didn't express those emotions and swallowed them all, repressing. At most I'd cry silently for a bit, or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror (silently of course) for a moment and stopped it.


So this is an example that's easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating, angering, etc. He would do something like that once a month, or twice a week, depending on my behavior. 9/10 times it was something ""small"", unlike the example I gave which is obvious to anyone, but those small things would also fill me with tears, shame and whatever. And, like I said, there was a frequency to it. Maybe it was misbehavior at school, or half assing some chore and he'd say something, sometimes normally sometimes not so much so. Something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably ""small"" for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation. This continued until I was around 14. 


We'd still laugh, play fight, and those things. The negative situations were a small portion of the time we spent together. But the influence of his skewed methods was evident. I was violent with my friends at school, like I'd twist their arm so they would admit I'm right or something, or making them flinch. I was never a bully, mind you, all of this was normal playing for me. I would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything. Once I was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foot/toed, it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part. No notable reaction from his part, just disbelief as in what's wrong with you. 


When I was 13 I lied big time for the first time ever (I skipped class and didn't give my parents the school's note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol) and when found out, I was grounded like this: I could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia, and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday, where I was so happy for them to finally smile at me. For this family lying is a big thing, in case you haven't noticed (it's a joking comment but also serious, they were very big on me telling the truth)


I fail high school like three or four times. I just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food, drinking coca cola etc. When I was 16 I guess, studying for a subject I had to pass to pass the year, my parents (mon and uncle) wanted to make sure I studied so he controlled the process. I went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone. After 3/4 hours uncle comes in and starts testing what I should have studied. I don't answer, I'm getting very anxious (like I am now just typing this out) in my belly (which always happened when I knew he would get angry after finding out about something I did wrong) and he understood what I had been doing so he takes my phone, puts it on the floor, grabs a thermos I had laying around and holds it above my phone, looking at me and asking me what was I really doing, he was barely containing his temper, his nostrils were flaring. I swore I just couldn't study or concentrate so he'd spare the phone. Something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like he'd drop it.


Some years later I'd be, again, failing the year so I had to pass on the subjects I owed. To make it simple there was an option where I could choose between a hard exam and an easy one. He said I should do the hard one, of course I agreed, but later I took the easy one. We were in my room when he found out. He went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg, where it hits a nerve or smt. He came up to my face and I instinctively covered my belly... He saw this and told me I shouldn't protect myself from him, that this was all due to my decisions or whatever. 


Not long after that I guess I failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because I was ""driving my mom crazy"" which is partially true btw, I was really stressing her out. I was lying to her every year, telling her I was studying and that I was passing my exams. 


Around this time I was hanging out at a friend's place and some movement he did made me flinch, something that had never happened with him. It wasn't even a sudden motion haha. I felt so anxious and ashamed God.


At some point he was ""done with me"" after I once more showed no cooperation with his ""help"". Literally, he said he'd be there for what's needed like he's not pretending I don't exist, but like our friendly relationship was over, basically for lying. Eventually I apologized and we had a long conversation, what he said boiled down to ""I'll really try but it'll be hard to rebuild trust, you can't mess up you understand? This time There will be no coming back from that one"". Mind you, this was a very serene, ""reasonable"" conversation! We were very calm and ""mature"". Btw, this happened one or two more times 😂. Like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and I were in the same room (cuz we'd barely talk and if I asked smt indirectly to him he'd be short, disinterested or didn't say anything) 


Anyway, I'm 23 now, he hasn't put a hand on me since that last time I mentioned. Of course still an intimidating man. Strong control issues. Constantly needs to prove to you that he is right. Very irritable. Oh and some months ago I brought up the subject mentioning how I don't know how it would turn this time out if he were to hit me now that I'm 23. He said calmly **""I'm still capable of turning you into a handicapped person""**


Now, a disclaimer: while on the emotional level there's tons of fear, resentment and anger towards him, cognitively I KNOW where he was coming from I'm not saying it was RIGHT, I'm saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow, the subconscious, repressed emotions or whatever term. It's not that  they don't know the importance of working on this and letting these things out, they don't even think there's anything ""wrong"". I've brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle. He just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem, to put it succinctly. No apology. My mom wasn't very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didn't see the emotional damage. He thinks he had to do it, but I Know that in reality he was, and is, carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization ""you were driving your mom mad"" ""you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time"" etc. I'm actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing. Lol. I was also told to basically stop victimizing myself.


He is like this but since he doesn't go around flipping out on everybody, nor did he do anything to me ""unjustified"", he was never stopped. I believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate. 


So as I said, on the mental aspect I know there's no point in looking for guilty ones, but emotionally I want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself. 


When I don't distract myself with the phone or any activity, some emotions come to attention, I may even cry for a second. This makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which I only have to let work by unclenching muscles, releasing mental tension, just relaxing and letting myself feel everything I've supressed for so long. 


I feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe that's buried even deeper.


Also I'm anxious about the moment I let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me. Like I can't make something up and but also the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible, or they'd just assume I was projecting the trauma from my biological father on my uncle. Lol. Sad. But I'll just let go at some point and that's it.


I've stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family, it's not wise to need their understanding, even if it's family.


I've come to realize that my social anxiety, awkwardness, emotional coldness towards family (I cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion. Gosh my grandma is severely ill and I struggle to be compassion, like I know it's there somewhere I can feel it sometimes but there's so much repressed BS covering it up), irritability towards family and many other things, are a result of this. This is good news for me because I now know it's not just random but a result of the mind's shadow.

im 14, time of the incident was around my bday. i was abusing benadryl and alcohol and other stuff to cope. mom found out, and instead of being caring (since she knows i have a history with self harm) she went on a fucking. rampage. yelling at me, not letting me process anything.

cue the argument heading downstairs, and it got a lot more heated. im crying and yelling at this point, not knowing how to handle anything. shes still screaming and extremely pissed. then, something i did made her snap. she hit me across the face and 'accidentally' broke my nose. i broke down even more, holding my hand under my nose and asking her for help. her response? 'its just a nosebleed.'

i eventually get it to stop by myself (in the bathroom with the door shut.) i leave the bathroom after not looking like i was crying, and my moms friend is over. to help *my mom* cope. while i am still extremely upset.

so fastforward to that evening because i dont remember much, my mom calls the FUCKING POLICE. because i was getting high on an allergy pill. police arrive, but im still in my pjs/gown with no panties on. (btw, all 4 officers were men.) im freaking out and being asked to change so they can take me to the hospital, and then i just went into full on panic mode. i was trying to delay them but after a while they made me leave my room. they dragged me down the stairs by my arms, all the while yelling to my mom who was behind them that it hurts and she said 'stop overreacting.' 

said officers strap me to a stretcher while i am still actively panicking, so i panic more. im loaded up into the ambulance without my mom, completely by myself without my phone. we get to the hospital, and im only able to cover my legs with a white sheet.

we waited for FOUR HOURS, no mental eval. the doctors knew my mom hit me and broke my nose, but they did nothing. we went home at 12am and i got my phone back the next day, but i didnt even care.

i dont know what to do. i didnt get any proof. corporal punishment is legal in my state but not like this. i told my friend but i was too scared to get them to call cps. im terrified of my mom now and ive told her. shes always been physical with punishment and it got worse when she found out i was cutting myself. my dad is about the same. i dont go to in person school until next year and i dont wanna be taken away from my house because they still get me stuff and it isnt that often. the worst thing right now is the constant arguing but im not in danger. i dont wanna hurt my parents but i dont know how to cope anymore. i deal with shit at school and at home. ive been mostly able to block out remembering everything but it just hit me like a truck. i just dont wanna be scared of my parents like i am now. i just had to play off the fact of why i was crying to my mom. i just feel like im stuck. i love my parents and i dont wanna leave them but i hate them at the same time. theyve never been there for me emotionally.

advice please. thank you."
"Im currently a 24F, the oldest daughter of the household, has a younger brother that is currently in high school, and I have a rather difficult and unstable relationship with my mother. However, even though our relationship has been toxic for as long as I can remember; that doesn't stop me from wanting to have a good relationship with her. There was a time where two years ago, I wanted to cut off all contact and go ""No contact,"" because I figured that was the best for me at the time; but flash forward to now, I realized that I felt guilty for wanting to go no contact, and am now trying to repair the broken relationship. I'm not sure whether its my inner child talking, or the ""oldest sibling trauma bond,"" that ties me close to her, or if deep down, I really truly want to have a relationship with her. 

Just to give some background information; both my parents are in a loveless marriage - but refuses to divorce and currently still lives in the same household. I am no longer living with them, but I still live rather close. I would say my current relationship with my mom is a little better than the relationship I had with her when I still lived at home; I would say it was more so physically abusive where she would throw silverware at me, hit me, and there was no sense of privacy at home. Since I am now no longer financially bound to her, she can't do those things. However, that doesn't stop her being very emotionally abusive and mentally very draining. She tends to be very jealous of my happiness in terms of wanting to hang out with my friends, constantly projects her insecurities onto me (since shes not in a happy marriage, she tells me not to ""waste time"" on building romantic relationships, or that friends doesn't matter as much as her (since she does not have friends). When I communicate to her that I want to be there emotionally for a friend or wants to spend time with a friend, she questions why I am wasting my life, and how no one will stay in my life forever. And this leads me down into a downward spiral of anxiety believing no one will stay with me or put up with me because she drills the mindset that ""no one will want to put up with me, that if I am a horrible daughter, why would anyone else want me?"" 

Keep in mind - I have always been a reasonable daughter. I have always passed all my classes, did well in school, took care of my brother, cooked for the family when my mom would go on vacation, I was there emotionally for my mom when she wanted to talk, was never judgemental, and always tried my best to see her. However, her nagging and persistent guilt tripping never ceases. She always picks at my appearance, my weight, claims that I'm a failure for not ""making enough,"" that I am not focusing on myself enough. There's so much more, but on to the topic of this post. Just recently, I was cleebrating my best friends birthday and was out at around 7-9pm for a painting session. I was not on my phone, but then took it out after I painted my mural and came to 10 missed calls from my mom back to back. I immediately got on the phone with her and told her where I was but she proceeded to guilt me for ""wasting time,"" and claimed that I see my best friend more than I see her. (keep in mind that I try to see my mom as much as I can, on average I see my mom at least three times a month). She told me that all I do was waste time, and then hung up on me when I was trying to explain myself - that caused my mood to steadily shift, and I wasn't able to enjoy myself. She then proceeds to text me quite like sending 10-20 texts exclaiming that I was ""still a child"" for not getting why she was calling so much, when I was trying to explain to her that she was making me feel uncomfortable and that I was trying to enjoy my night without her guilting. That led to her calling me immature and proceeds to not listen to me. By that time, I was fed up and then left the birthday celebration early because I felt too guilty for staying longer. 

It just sucks because I feel like there are times my mom and I can seldom get along and have a good time, but it just never lasts. When I do have a good time with her, it makes me disassociate and lowkey convinces me that none of it is real - that she is only nice to get something from me. That even if she is nice, I can never fully be myself without feeling judged. I do not feel comfortable with confiding in her about anything, because her first response is always to judge me for my mistakes, and never to comfort or guide me. She is a ball of negativity, and I can never feel truly at ease. She can be very volatile with her words and actions, and it is hard for me to predict what she will do next. Today, I thought about doing therapy for the first time, especially to bring her along with me for the journey. I decided to research some therapists within our insurance network and thought to myself how she would take my idea. So I decided to message her and ask whether she was willing to do therapy to fix/improve our relationship, since she has told me various times when she was in a good mood that she wants to be closer to me. She responds with ""what?!"" in a very judgemental way, and I proceeded to explain to her that I think it would be good for our relationship and for both of us individually to be able to emotionally connect and bond, and she has not responded to me. It has been a full day, and it is abnormal for her to not respond. Usually when she is like this, she does not agree with my ideas and refuses to communicate. 

I'm not sure if it is even worth for me to try to convince her that therapy can be a good idea, if that was her initial reaction. I feel as if my whole life, I have to beg her or reason with her a thousand times to get her to see from my perspective. She is an extremely stubborn, selfish woman with possibly undiagnosed narcissism, and I'm not sure if I should even try. I'm very mentally drained to the point of giving up and not even trying anymore on our relationship because it just feels like nothing is changing. 

Any kind of thoughts or commentary would help. :) I would really appreciate it!!

"Long post. I'm writing this to vent, for acknowledgment, and to possibly ask some questions. But mainly for venting because I feel so alone regarding this. I'll l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of what's up. 


I'm 23. Family is from Eastern Europe, Soviet-ish culture. Immigrated to Argentina in 2000, that's when I was born. 


My life up until 7yo: I don't remember anything basically. So, all of this is what I've been told. Father lied a lot and was hysterical, when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes, my mother always put me in another room so I wouldn't witness that. When I was 1 I was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out, dad wanted me to stop, I didn't so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door. At some point during this period up until 7yo he said that i should ""fear him, like an animal"". He never laid a hand on me but had outbursts. When I'm 7 mom divorces him. 


So after that, I've always lived with my mom, grandparents and uncle (all maternal) up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place, visits weekly. 


Dad left the country 4 years later, when I was 11, and before that he'd pick me up 3/4 times a year. I'm told I wasn't really sad when he left. Btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me. Musicians are evil freemasons, the number 11 everywhere, that kinda thing. Once at like 10yo, in the shower, I broke down and called my mom to talk because I couldn't handle all the bad-mouthing that my father was talking about them (my family). I went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when I was 20 and luckily snapped out of it. 


So after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure. Which I guess was even more so when my actual father left the country. From this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which I feel have conditioned me, I'll share a few representative examples. 


We were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking I told him to ""shut up"" (in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up), the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheek/mouth from his part.


This was some months later I'm sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks. Uncle comes in says we are eating soon so don't eat any more chocolate. When he came back to call me to dinner he sees I ate all the chocolate, takes the water bottle and empties it on my head. It was at keast half full, because I remember even the matress soaking on the part I was sitting. He told me to stay there, so I couldn't change and even had to sleep on that matress. Idk how this would make you feel but for me it's a good example of the humiliation, anger, shame and whatnot that I felt with some frequency from his actions. Given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me, I always felt intimidated, afraid, so I didn't express those emotions and swallowed them all, repressing. At most I'd cry silently for a bit, or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror (silently of course) for a moment and stopped it.


So this is an example that's easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating, angering, etc. He would do something like that once a month, or twice a week, depending on my behavior. 9/10 times it was something ""small"", unlike the example I gave which is obvious to anyone, but those small things would also fill me with tears, shame and whatever. And, like I said, there was a frequency to it. Maybe it was misbehavior at school, or half assing some chore and he'd say something, sometimes normally sometimes not so much so. Something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably ""small"" for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation. This continued until I was around 14. 


We'd still laugh, play fight, and those things. But it was clear the influence of his skewed methods. I was violent with my friends at school, like I'd twist their arm so they would admit I'm right or something, or making them flinch. I was never a bully, mind you, all of this was normal playing for me. I would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything. Once I was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foot/toed, it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part. No notable reaction from his part, just disbelief as in what's wrong with you. 


When I was 13 I lied big time for the first time ever (I skipped class and didn't give my parents the school's note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol) and when found out, I was grounded like this: I could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia, and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday, where I was so happy for them to finally smile at me. For this family lying is a big thing, in case you haven't noticed (it's a joking comment but also serious, they were very big on me telling the truth)


I fail high school like three or four times. I just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food, drinking coca cola etc. When I was 16 I guess, studying for a subject I had to pass to pass the year, my parents (mon and uncle) wanted to make sure I studied so he controlled the process. I went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone. After 3/4 hours uncle comes in and starts testing what I should have studied. I don't answer, I'm getting very anxious (like I am now just typing this out) in my belly (which always happened when I knew he would get angry after finding out about something I did wrong) and he understood what I had been doing so he takes my phone, puts it on the floor, grabs a thermos I had laying around and holds it above my phone, looking at me and asking me what was I really doing, he was barely containing his temper, his nostrils were flaring. I swore I just couldn't study or concentrate so he'd spare the phone. Something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like he'd drop it.


Some years later I'd be, again, failing the year so I had to pass on the subjects I owed. To make it simple there was an option where I could choose between a hard exam and an easy one. He said I should do the hard one, of course I agreed, but later I took the easy one. We were in my room when he found out. He went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg, where it hits a nerve or smt. He came up to my face and I instinctively covered my belly... He saw this and told me I shouldn't protect myself from him, that this was all due to my decisions or whatever. 


Not long after that I guess I failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because I was ""driving my mom crazy"" which is true btw, I was really stressing her out. 


At some point he was ""done with me"" after I once more showed no cooperation with his ""help"". Literally, he said he'd be there for what's needed like he's not pretending I don't exist, but like our friendly relationship was over, basically for lying. Eventually I apologized and we had a long conversation, what he said boiled down to ""I'll really try but it'll be hard to rebuild trust, you can't mess up you understand? This time There will be no coming back from that one"". Mind you, this was a very serene, ""reasonable"" conversation! We were very calm and ""mature"". Btw, this happened one or two more times 😂. Like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and I were in the same room (cuz we'd barely talk and if I asked smt indirectly to him he'd be short, disinterested or didn't say anything) 


Anyway, I'm 23 now, he hasn't put a hand on me since that last time I mentioned. Of course still an intimidating man. Strong control issues. Constantly needs to prove to you that he is right. Very irritable.


Now, a disclaimer: while on the emotional level there's tons of fear, resentment and anger towards him, cognitively I KNOW where he was coming from I'm not saying it was RIGHT, I'm saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow, the subconscious, repressed emotions or whatever term. It's not that  they don't know the importance of working on this and letting these things out, they don't even think there's anything ""wrong"". I've brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle. He just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem, to put it succinctly. No apology. My mom wasn't very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didn't see the emotional damage. He thinks he had to do it, but I Know that in reality he was, and is, carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization ""you were driving your mom mad"" ""you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time"" etc. I'm actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing. Lol. I was also told to basically stop victimizing myself.


He is like this but since he doesn't go around flipping out on everybody, nor did he do anything to me ""unjustified"", he was never stopped. I believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate. 


So as I said, on the mental aspect I know there's no point in looking for guilty ones, but emotionally I want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself. 


When I don't distract myself with the phone or any activity, some emotions come to attention, I may even cry for a second. This makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which I only have to let work by unclenching muscles, releasing mental tension, just relaxing and letting myself feel everything I've supressed for so long. 


I feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe that's buried even deeper.


Also I'm anxious about the moment I let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me. Like I can't make something up and yet the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible, or they'd just assume I was projecting my biological father's trauma on my uncle. Lol. Sad. But I'll just let go at some point and that's it.


I've stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family, it's not wise to need their understanding, even if it's family.


I've come to realize that my social anxiety, awkwardness, emotional coldness towards family (I cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion. Gosh my grandma is severely ill and I struggle to be compassion, like I know it's there somewhere I can feel it sometimes but there's so much repressed BS covering it up), irritability towards family and many other things, are a result of this. This is good news for me because I now know it's not just random but a result of the mind's shadow.


That's it I suppose"

"  TW Ab4se

Hello, Im a 15 year old soon to be 16 year old  in an mentally and verbally abusive relationship. I have been abused by my father  almost as long as I can remember. I have wanted out for years but I couldn't do that to my dad. 

   While my dad is an abusive human being he does have times when he seems like a great dad.  Like when he would get me ice cream or listen and try to help me when I was bullied in elementary school. I wanted to leave but since my dad still showed a nice side even though a lot of it was out of wanting to control me. I thought I could fix him or make him a better father but I was wrong. No matter how hard I tried to tell him what he was doing was wrong. whether it was yelling loudly at me for small things or blaming his behavior on me or claiming it wasnt abuse  he never listened or tried to change his behavior. There was a lot more he did then that I just wanted to give some examples.( He convinced it wasnt abuse when I was a little kid.

   Now that I am 15 and I am finally realizing he wont change and staying because I don't wanna hurt him isn't worth it I want out, I finally took my moms offer to get full custody of me. Yesterday we finally sat down as a family. Me, my mom and my stepdad. (My mom silt from my dad a long time ago but they never married just had a long term relationship.( I explained what I wanted and why. They already had known about it for years and they wanted to get me out a while ago. 

   The thing is since my mom and step dad started doing research about how getting full custody would work. And my mom ask her friends who had been in custody battles. They figured out that it would almost be impossible for my mom to get full custody because he never hit me or assaulted me. And how then can last over an year and it wasn't worth it because of how close I am to 18. They said they really wanted to but there were so many things in the way. And that it would completely ruin me and my dads relationship that is ruined all ready and how it would it be really mad for my already bad mental health. 

   I talked to my therapist about this and she said she would email my mom and try to figure something out but there's still a big chance it wouldn't work. I really cant take anymore. I was done a long time ago. I'm so tired. I just want it to end. So I'm on abuse reddit  looking for hel. I known that states handle this kind of thing differently. I live in oregon if that helps. If anyone can help PLEASE do.

Also sorry that this was long and all the background information. 😥"
abusive household. i dont have alot of freedom and i dont know how to really be independent as parents have always took control over everything in my life. what do i need to prepare? whatever the cost is ill try my best to earn it. what are some expenses ill need to keep in mind? im currently saving up 
"my parents were barely present for me growing up, and when they actually here the only attention i got from them was them yelling at me and being upset

now in people i have attraction too its always cold and dismissive people, emotionally unavailable, people that dont properly love me. im always chasing after their validation its like a high for me. i dont like people that care for me too much, that are emotional and too loving. i hate that im like this ill never be happy. even if i get away from my parentd they have affected my future relationships and ill always have this trauma "
"my parents are abusive and theres been times where i wanna call the cops on them, but they hold evidence against me so i cant do anythinng
i forged my mom's signature to try to open a bank account since my parents wont help me make one myself and at the time i thought iy would be a good idea
i had a meltdown one time and threw something at my mom. i have bad anger issues and my parents were aggrivting me on purpose
my dad recorded it and i ran to the basement, they were sil recording me and my mom got on me and was holding me down. i was having a panic atyaxk and i was begging her to let go and i was overstimuated. i tried yo push me off and she wouldnt so i started to pull her hair and bite her as hard as i could, then my dad got a glass of cold water and threw it on me

i feel pressured into being silenced i cant get help, i usually never get agressive woth my parents but being abusived for years i snapped. i hold np evidence against my parents so theyll always have something against me. im so scared of them"
does anyone else have a hard time recalling traumatic events. sometimes i wanna vent about how abusive my parents are but then ill forget what theyve done.. i know theyve done some horrible things tp me but its hard remembering specifically what.. because i camt remember it makes me feel like its not a big deal on whatever yhe fuck they did to me
"Hi, this is my first time in reddit, anyways, to keep it short, my parents refused to let me inter university of my choice even though it’s free, and forced me into the nearer college where there is like 4 major or something like that, and none of them was for me none of them was even the choice number five on my list, i really tried to get into it and continue my life, but I simply couldn’t, I couldn’t study something i will never get a job with, there is no jobs for me with this major so what’s the point? This drove me into depression more, i have no future career, i have a hobby which i want to develop into business but the stress from the college and my parents can’t let me do anything, its started to affect me physically, panic attacks, throwing up, severe insomnia, and others, my parents are controlling and don’t really about what anyone want, hell even they don’t want anything, they never wanted me to be successful at all, they prevented me from getting any kind of job through high school, i am broke I can’t even get out, i am trying to make some money online but as i said stress and anxiety are eating me alive, what should i do?! My father doesn’t care that much about me going to college because either way, he wont give me a penny, nothing new there, the problem is my mom, she skipped college because of my father, and my father in short is and emotionally abusive and a narcissist who mad my mother’s life hell, she is obsessed over college because she thinks her life would better with a degree, but i know that a degree wouldn’t help her leaving my father 20 years ago so it’s irrelevant… "
"That's all I can label this as right now. I am currently a F(17) with 7 sisters. 3 moved out and one doesn't live with me so I'm not counting them. That means there are 3 sisters that live with me. Now, I didn't realize this before, but my mom is a major bully. 

I should've realized it from middle school when my mom read my diary. She sat me down to make me watch her read it and continued to make me sit while she told me why my thoughts were wrong. She also does this thing. When she tells us to do something that we don't quickly do or we don't understand, she talks in a way that makes us seem retarded and says ""Because this is the only way I can make you understand."" My sisters encourage it by laughing but I don't think that's very funny. Probably because I've been called stupid twice by her and ignorant once.

She's also made me feel like I'm ungrateful. I probably am. I have so many electronics from her (a phone, a laptop, a TV, a tablet) and she keeps food in our stomachs with a place to live. But, if I know one thing about manipulation, it's that people will do whatever it takes for you to let them keep treating you the way they are. Every time she and my dad would argue, we'd go somewhere fun like bowling, or she'd sit us down to talk about it and ask us how we felt. She doesn't really care. She has told me a lot that she doesn't care what I think. That it's disrespectful if I try to tell her why something isn't a good idea. She would also go out of her way to explain to me, her child btw, what's going on with her situation with my dad why she hates him, and why he doesn't care about us. He does btw. 

She also goes out to make it like something's my fault when she could've chosen an easier route. I'm not comfortable talking about that story yet, but she gaslights a lot.

I cry... a lot. I'm a Pisces, what can I say? But, when I do, my mom calls me a crybaby. Remember when she read my diary? Afterward, she asked me if I was done with my ""woe is me act."" But, I feel like my ""act"" is a way better reaction than having temper tantrums like she does. She once threw something at her bedroom door and it went into the kitchen and almost hit me. Not to mention the amount of times she slammed her door.

Please don't tell me to talk to her about it, because she's too stubborn. Even her own family sees it. I can't bring in a trusted adult, none of that. And, get this, she's already in therapy. I just hate this woman! And I don't want to, but I do.  I want to get out of here, but I want to also protect my sisters from her. All of them! One of them is my half, so my dad probably won't be able to take custody of her."
"Hi. Today I needed to find the answer to my question. Are my parents Abusive? Growing I always knew that I was different. For one I’m short. I’m 15 and I’m 5ft so I was bullied for that. And anytime I try to stand up for myself my dad would beat me with his belt. And I guess I was the baby of the house I didn’t really had to do anything which would eventually hurt my in the future. So all of these things made me weak and introverted. And I think growing up we were poor. One time I remember that we could afford the electricity bill and me and my sisters had to give our money to our mom to pay it. My and my brother didn’t even have a console or anything like that because according to my dad “ it’s a waste of time” I wasn’t allowed to go over to other peoples houses because according to my dad “ i need to study “ but it was perfectly fine for him to take us to his friends houses. I think his beating went too far. Like for example he caught my older brother lets calling him Tyler drawing on the walls and he beat him. But one event that happened to me I will never forget. One day after swim practice which I hated and got no say in my dad was cussing Tyler out because I think he joked or threaten to shoot ip his middle school. He was in 8th grade and I was in 5th grade. I chuckled like and idoit until after I finished taking a shower. When I heated my twin let’s call her Leah and came run to her. I found out to Tyler ran away and after hours we found him at the public pool. I still remember that night eating food with the last Fanta bottle and my sisters watching Olympic swimmers. It was traumatizing. And I was afraid of getting beaten or getting in trouble so didn’t tell my teachers or friends. when I went during the summer I visited my cousins in Spokane wa. And after that I had to live I. My parents other house because we couldn’t afford to live in our original home. So after weeks of sleeping and doing nothing because I didn’t have a phone at the time but my sisters did because my mom had to find a way to communicate with us directly the school year started. But then Covid 19 came in March 2020 and when we were released to spring break that break lasted the rest of the year even though we still had to do our work online. In my 7th grade I was online till may to do my starr test. Online sucked and the teachers didn’t really care about us online kids. 8th grade year and I thought it would be different but I was wrong. Eventually my dad said we were moving to Spokane and I was excited because it was a new start for me. But when I left I winter break I barely got my old friends contacts and I have been trying to contact them ever since. My new middle school was okay but I was very alone at the beginning. Then my freshman year rolled in and was okay. Oh I forgotten to mention that during my 8th grade year my older brother Tyler to my older sister lets call her Jackie if she wanted to sigh up for driving class because she as a sophomore at the time and refused this will be important later on. So then my sophomore year came and it was okay at the start but it took a turn for the worst. So took get money we would have to do the clothes for the patients my parents were working to take care of. In fact we live above them In a basement. That’s why we moved here. But lately we have stoped doing them because our mother wouldn’t pay us on time. So after weeks of this my mother came downstairs with a broom to beat my sisters and I had enough. Even though Tyler was across from my mom I had to go and stop her and to still her to leave. Then my twin Leah was bruised on the hand my older sister left the house for safety with my cousins. And after weeks of her staying with them she came back. During our spring break at the end of it in April I had to go stay upstairs to watch the patients but I had to go for my hair cut with Tyler so it was Leah or Jamie and it couldn’t really be Leah because she had stayed up their for any hour but Jamie could do it because she had to go out with her friend. This is get too long but I will com with apart two to this so stay tune.  

Update 1: Jamie and my Mom had a huge argument. Jamie said that her friends moms always treat their daughters better than our mom does. While either they are stay at home moms, or they actually manage and be engaged with daughters to cook food for them. I think one of the main reasons is because we live in an adult family home where the patients live with us. So my dad and my have to take care of them 24 hours a day. She doesn’t have time to cook us dinner every night and the food that she does cook is for the patients which I DO NOT EAT because it used canned foods. Usually Tyler cooks us dinner or we would have to manage on our own. Going back to the situation the argument escalated and my mom said if these friends moms were better than her then she should go live with them. And that’s what Jamie did. She packed some of her stuff and left. When me and Tyler came back, me and him had no idea of the situation that happened. Mom was just saying how ungrateful Jamie was and stuff. Then at around 8pm when I was on my phone Leah came up to me to whisper that Jamie was not coming back. Then my dad came to Leah and Jamie room to interrogate Leah on the whereabouts of my sister which she didn’t know. Dad then called Jamie with Leah phone saying you need to return now but Jamie refused.  That night I could barely sleep because I didn’t know how to process this situation. What about school? In days following the event I was scared that my parents will forcefully take my sister back at lunch where half the school is to each lunch. I can’t describe the anxiety that came. So I talk to my world history about this and he had is suspicions on what was going on because Jamie was acting strange in his class. But when didn’t have time to talk and suggest to go to the counselor office. I did and talked with my 10th and 12th grade counselor and they really helped me. After a couple of weeks they successfully got me sister back after wanting to ask the police to label her as a runaway. Honesty looking back on it now both sides to blame.  My parents for not wanting to talk it out. They have a “ it our way or no way” attitude. One of the main reasons of Jamie running is because of the lack of space in the house. Like I said we live in an adult family home where patients live. They all have either room to themselves with an exemption.       But we live downstairs which is a weird living room basement hybrid. They are only 2 rooms downstairs one for my parents and one of my sisters. Me and Tyler have no room and live in the “ living room”. It sucks because there is no privacy.  Worse there is also a kitchen here and people can just walk in uninvited in my space. So when ever I want to jack off I have to do it under my blanket. And my parents what I do under my blanket as if I making cocaine under their when I’m just a hormonal teenager. It is a nightmare living here. When we first moved I thought we just be staying here for a couple of months until we bought another house to live in. We actually did. Although that house was still going to be an adult family home the space downstairs was nice but only had 2 bedrooms. But I was still happy it a massive living room downstairs which could install a lock making it my own room. But of course life could never be that easy. We later found out that my parents were going to rent out the rooms for money even though we moved all of our stuff in the garage.

Words cannot describe how shocking and devastating this news was. 

Of all the times to have privacy being a teenager had to be the most important. It is also a reason I haven’t bring any friends to my house because I’m embarrassed of the patients and how unclean the house is.  Even if it was clean there is no room to do anything. 

Everything has been okay recently but I truly wish for things to get better. Sometimes I look at the stars at night saying to myself when I become famous to never forget where I came from.  Where a hormaonal teenager had to with sever paitents that need a lot of care with no room to myself and my parents being fucking bitches. More updates in the future will come. So stay tuned"
"I broke a lamp, I was joking with my mother and I extended my arm to emphise something and knocked over a lamp. My mom kneeled next to it and was about to start screaming at me. I took my phone, water, shoes and left the house immediately. I forgot my earphones though, so thats sad. This has happend a lot, it slowed down a lot more recently but eh, guess some things never do change.

So I'm just outside, it's 3 am and I just feel empty. I always do during these sorts of things. It's easier that way, I don't feel regret. I don't really feel afraid. I feel midly disguisted with myself thst I bothered my friend for comfort. I'm pretty sure this is dissociation, and I don't know. I'm bored, I can't listen to music. I mean I could, but I dont ant to bother the other tenets here.

Someone got shot and robbed yesterday so this probably isn't safe

"Ever since I could remember I've hated my life. My sisters are spoiled and crazy to say the least.  they would always get their way with my mother. My father was always working somewhere so he had no idea about this at the time and my 2 brothers would always go with him because they were ""old enough"" so It would always be my abusive part of the family and 4y/o me. My mom hated me, hated taking care of me, hated my voice, everything. She would often hit me for the littlest things, and every single time all I would see is her fist before getting whacked in the head. I often was just left shaking and crying alone. She was abusive physically and mentally often bringing me down when I accomplished something or calling Me a ""mistake."" She would often encourage my sisters to do also which only hurt me worse. After a year of that same process about everyday my parents started having problems. My mom was having an affair with a guy who I will call ""Pedro""
You see Pedro was a guy who essentially drove my family to shredding its self to pieces. He alone remains the one human who I want to cause brain trauma to with my fists alone. He was  fucking my mom without my dad knowing for about a year. Once my dad found out he was devastated. This devested me as my dad was and still is a really good person. Seeing him cry hit my heart harder than a bullet. Pedro encouraged my mother to hit my dad as she hit me. Which she did. And my father being the good person he is never hit her back he just avoided any physical problems from her. This was when she tried to get lethal with him and almost killed us in the process. She also began hitting me more and also started on my other brothers. My sisters ofcourse joined in. For a few weeks I endured this  until I snapped at my two sisters. I beat the shot out of then (I was 5 and them being 13 and 14) and since I'm naturally really strong I ended up breaking their noses and busting one of their lips. My mom was not happy. She cursed at me grabbed a metal rod and whacked me in the jaw breaking a lot of my teeth and drawing out a ton of blood. About an hour later my dad came home and he saw my bloody mess of a face and he finally realized what my mom does to us (we never told him due to fear). He started yelling at my mom to the point in which she grabbed that same rod and tried to whack him in the head full force. He had to run out since she could and would kill him if he didn't. He essentially had to go hide out for about a day in his truck in fear for his life. My mom later began packing her things and literally dragged my brothers and me to the car dropping us off on some dark alley in the middle of the night just so she can prove a point to my dad that she is not playing. After she essentially abandoned us probably heading to Pedro's place. Our dad ended up finding us. We told him everything and he was again devastated from the fact that she abandoned us and went with that piece of shit of a human Pedro. When  went home our sisters were nowhere to be seen meaning that they went with her. But the worst thing is that they trashed our house. Destroyed everything and threatened us with even worse. It was so bad that we had to get legal. And since we were not financially stable we could not afford a lawyer till then end of this legal battle which lasted 3 years. And since we had no evidence the cops could not do nothing. No DNA no cameras nothing. So for about 5 months our dad had to stay home without working just to raise us (by this point I was 7). After those 5 months ended we heard glass shatter in a lot of windows. And I recognized the people, they were my mothers friends who were gangsters or just bad people. The first thing they did is break the only phone that we had so we could not record nor call the cops. They then demanded for us to go with them essentially a kidnapping scenario. But because they caused such a ruckus our neighbor who I'll call ""Juan"" came out with a shotgun threatening them and scaring them off .he then called the cops and some of them got arrested. and they asked us to share details to them so we told them who they were sent by my mom, so ofc they went and interegated her. Which she had her family alibi her along with her friends and some co workers ending up with an Unsolved case. So all we could do now is just save up money and plead in court. 2 years later when I turned 10 we testified in court and we ended up getting re compensated 10k In damage and my dad got full custody of me and my brothers while my mom with my sisters. And for a year we lived in piece. When I turned 11 we (my dad and brother and me) were evicted from out house we would remain homeless for about another year till we managed to rebt out a beat up old home to maintain us as we stay financially in trouble. I later am forced to work for anything (fixing cars, selling candy at school, lawn mowing, etc...) selling candy was the best for me as I was a good negotiator which helped with rent just barely enough to get by. And 2 years later we still are financially struggling but now I get to feel what an average boy my age feels and I've never been so happy. While my mom gets abused now by that mf Pedro. Which is deserved but still angers me. But I'll let them settle it. Its sad that 13 years of my life were completely shit but on the bright side I'm stronger physically and mentally. And I will get money and I will help My dad out get his dreams when I'm older. Get him a truck or buy him a nice house in the coast as he always dreamed of. Mark my words...

Note: I'm 13 now and am now for the first time in my life have friends.

Note 2 : I still love my mom and my sisters 

Note 3: my sisters are a lot calmer now but they do drugs which is retarded but it their life now.

Note 4: my dad's side of the family lives In my home country Honduras which is why they were not involved. If they were things would have ended up way better

Final note: I left out a lot of things some are worse than this but, those are things that are really personal

Thank you for your time, and goodnight"

" TW: Family abuse, suicide.

Summary: sick of supporting my mum when all she does is complain and put me and my child at risk.

It has been nearly 20 years since my mum has pulled me into her DV situation (emotional, coercive, financial abuse). Most recently she tried to OD this week because of my dad's abuse and I supported her for a few days at my place after she was released from emergency.

I'm feeling really frustrated, sad and disappointed because the help I have been giving her was thrown back into my face over the last two days. 

Specifically, I helped get her a counsellor appointment and secure her banking/phone/email as my dad has all her passwords. She forgot her phone code and went off at me; she was the one that set it. She then went on and on about how I'm adding more fuel to the fire by making her do stuff (I wasnt, I was working) and I'm just causing her more problems and not giving her space to think. I've taken time off work to help her, I've spent hours collecting evidence for her when she asked, and I've been getting advice and helplines and provided her phone numbers. She's the one that has been running around doing stuff like talking to my dad and the other women, telling me whats going on constantly and wanting to talk, trying to go back to work the day after being in emergency.

I feel bad saying this, but I told her I'm done because all she does is blame me. Its been 20 years and shes following the same pattern where I get all the blame and become the blacksheep. Plus I found out she had been betraying my trust and giving my dad access to personal info like my address and pictures of my kid when I expressly asked her not to because I'm no contact (dad abused me too).

Am I a terrible person? Has anyone felt the same or can empathise?"
"I was abused by my parents, grandma, and family friends from childhood to adulthood. It was awful and painful experience. There are more details about what happened like I was told that you are stupid, nothing, and other negative words and actions. I didn’t even realized how fucked up until when I was older and went to therapy for that. It was not normal at all. It wasn’t my fault for what happened about it. Thank you so much for listening and texting with this. It means a lot to me. "
"To preface, two things:

1. I'm not suggesting this itself is abuse, I just think it's telling about his mindset.
2. The abuse I suffered was mostly emotional and verbal and definitely compared to some of the other people here much more mild. It still scarred me heavily though. But that doesn't mean I'm not aware that many people have experienced way worse.

Anyway, that out of the way... I was working with my father on something. And it made me start to notice something. He uses the word ""perfect"" more than anyone else I've ever known.

Like every time he would do something he would do it very carefully. And when he was finished he would talk about how it was perfect.

If I screwed up in any way, he would get angry and insult me. And at one point yelled at me that I can't do anything right when I briefly dropped a nail I was supposed to hand him.

I know that I, as a person, have kind of an obsession with doing everything perfectly. And being perfect, basically. I'm extremely perfectionist. It's one of the reasons I have body dysmorphia, because I can't stand being anything but beautiful. Anything less is not good enough. And it's part of why I have performance anxiety and struggled emotionally to get through college, because if I didn't get perfect grades I would hate myself and want to die.

And, you know, I guess I just see a connection between these two things. My father would constantly talk about ""perfection"" (using that word) and accept nothing less and yell at me or insult me if I screwed up in any way (sometimes for like an hour straight). And I can't accept being anything except perfect or doing anything not perfectly. And I feel deeply worthless inside most of the time.

I guess being obsessed with perfection is not so strange when your father is constantly talking about it and yells at you for anything less.

This might seem obvious, but I'm very much an adult and yet I only realized like a year ago exactly how much the guy uses that word. Or how it might have affected me. And now that I've started noticing it, I think about it every time he says it. Which is basically every time (multiple times) we work on anything together."
"We live in a very southern area, kind of in the middle of nowhere to be honest, and the only homeless shelter seems to not be an option for me.

My mom has gone back and forth a lot on whether or not she wants to kick me out, but right now I'm going into this with the belief that she probably will. She probably has undiagnosed BPD and/or NPD and cycles between abuse and love-bombing quite often. She outed me as queer to my grandparents (one of them watches far-right nazi content online and has made their opinions VERY clear) and I don't feel safe living with them 

I'm struggling mentally, and I've come to the conclusion that I probably have pretty severe OCD, although I don't feel safe telling my mom this, as opening up about anything mental illness related has caused me to be emotionally and physically abused in the past. I bring this up because social interaction is really fucking hard for me, and the thought of trying to find a roommate or a job kinda stresses me out, definitely more-so than it would with most people. I've also been depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed most of the day, which is seemingly furthering her resentment towards me.

I'm typing this on a back-up cellphone that my mom doesn't seem to know about. I have to keep this phone either under my pillow, my bed, or in one of my shoes to prevent her from finding it. She took my regular phone after finding out I was extensively researching abuse and housing options. She told me word for word that ""she knows I'm trying to escape, and she won't make it easy on me"". I have MAYBE 2 people who I could imagine staying with for a while, but it's realistically not very likely. Getting an online job or doing something of that sort just isn't possible, as my mom took the keyboard to my computer.

There's really no other family that I can think of, and I don't have very many friends nearby. I have around 250 bucks in my wallet at the moment but that's it. I had a job, but she made me quit because she didn't want to make it easy for me to ""escape"". She's mentioned me getting another job a few days ago, but I don't know when that would be. 

Again, I want to really clarify this. We live in a VERY southern town, with VERY few shelters or job opportunities. I also do not have a driver's license or any kind of way to really travel. Public transport isn't really a thing here.

Any kind of advice would be wonderful. I'll clarify anything in the comments if I need to.

EDIT - I have a ldr partner, and we do plan to move in together at some point, but that might not be for a while due to a variety of different reasons. "

"my mom has two kids (me 25NB and my sister 23F) and my aunt has one (19F). thing is theyre in their 50s and instead of doing a lot of things for themselves, theyll make us do it. esp for things like downloading things or for filing stuff. she’s been making me do this since i was a kid and only recently started w my sister. it pisses me off cus my aunt doesnt even rely on her kid even tho she can do it. and its even worse cus we live one block away from my aunt. my grandpa lives w her and they make us send him to the mosque by grab (the ride sharing app in sg) every friday even tho tbh she or my cousin could do it. its frustrating cus they act entitled to it and cant handle the fact that we might not want to. my mom is just. horrible and used to and still does lash out at us and expect us to know everything abt the forms/websites we have to help her with even tho we dont. ive been tired for so long bcus of this. and my mom lets my sister since young boss me ard too. to the pt where they make me take drinks for them like a maid even tho they can do it themselves. she yells at us when things dont go her way and expects us to be free labour. even tho she said we shd “focus on out studies, she’ll focus on housework” she would force us to clean w us and would lash out during it. she would slam plates and things ard and use the vacuum to shove things out of her way. to the pt where now im scared of vacuum sounds. it sucks and im so tired but they all mock me for being so tired. i sleep 12 hours a day now that im unemployed and it sucks even worse that they still rely on me a lot for things. and when i dont like my aunt or get upset at her my mom brings up the things she bought for us as kids and how she and her tbh always buy us crap we didnt ask for. i get its not super abusive, but they are manipulative and so. horrible. i get so tired living w them. i wish i was never born"
"I get told I'm 'defensive' constantly, for years. I get told I don't listen, and that I shut down.

But then, for example, my mom reads off the label of a supplement I'm supposed to be taking, and gets concerned that it'll interact with what I've already got. I try to assure her that I don't think my doctor would prescribe that to me if that was a major risk. (It's not, I just looked it up).

She reads off my regular meds' bottle anyway, and says ""this also causes fatigue""! Because she refuses to listen to me in general, but especially in regards to what's actually causing the disabilities that I have, one of the major ones being CFS. Even though I try to share information, videos, articles, infographics, etc. 

I meekly tell her that I don't think it's from that, that's all I say, but my reasoning is because I've been fatigued for over five years and just starting taking this medication last year.

And she just... storms out of the room, wordlessly. And it's not just the actions but how she does things... she's extremely cold and severe, and yet she's normal with my father, and he's the same way.

I just... I know this subreddit would understand better than any the feeling this causes, just being made to wonder if you're insane, or if you're actually acting out and being unreasonable. But I pack myself into a box just to try to appease my parents and try to reduce the emotional abuse.

Today was a really fucking horrible day. I'm having a mental episode that my mom dismissed as me just needing to eat and take supplements and drink water. 

If I try to express that I need more emotionally I get yelled at and told that they ARE emotionally supportive, and if I contest that, I get hit with the ""oh I guess we're awful parents then"" card. 

I screamed into my pillow today to try to feel better. I try talking to friends about it but what can they do? Why would they want to listen? "
"okay obviously i'm gonna hope this remains anonymous because he won't listen to me on talking to someone about getting help. but i wanna know if there's anything legal that can be done here because we've run out of options. i (19 f) have been dating my (19 m) boyfriend for about 9 months now and his mom has gotten worse throughout the course of our relationship. to sum things up as a whole (it's a lot): 1. anytime he has a job and makes his own money she comes up with any reason on why she doesn't like that job and forces him to quit; so he can't keep a job or make his own money.   

she's very very religious and forces him to go to church every sunday and also actively attempts to force him to join a youth group or else she says she'll kick him out. 

she makes him do all the household chores, (he basically cleans the whole house), pick up and drop off his siblings to and from school etc.
 he's in charge of making sure they've eaten and done their homework, and if any of his siblings get in trouble for doing anything, he's blamed for ""not being a good influence"" or ""not watching them good enough"" as if he's the parent in the house. 

she manipulates him and says HE'S manipulative and that all he does is take from her. 

she fat shames him and will sometimes tell him that he eats too much of their food as a ""grown man"" and that he's only allowed to eat dinner or food he's bought himself. (once again has no money because she makes him quit every job). and then she tells him that he's lazy and ""can't keep a job""

she's emotionally abusive, she always has to be the victim. she lies about him cursing and yelling at her which he never does. he's always calm. 

he had a good amount of money at one time that he was payed and she told him he had to put it in a savings account that only she has access to ""so he doesn't spend it all."" so he has no access to that money as of right now.

she kicks him out every few months for any reason she can find and leaves him to walk the streets alone at night, knowing that he has nowhere to go. (when he was a minor she'd kick him out, then report him to the police as a runaway).

she tells him that she doesn't think he should have a girlfriend and gets really upset anytime he spends times with me. 

she tells him that she doesn't care about him doing certain things but then when he does them, she'll turn around and scream at punish him. 

she got on him forever about how he was lazy because he wasn't in school (he graduated 2023) and then he got into college for film, in which he was excited to meet new people and make friends, and he went for ONE week before she made him switch to online so that he can be home to take care of his siblings and do chores.

she'll take his phone anytime she gets annoyed or mad while he's waiting for calls about interviews or calls from his counselor, causing him to miss important calls and lose opportunities on getting a job or doing good in school

and she's currently moving him into a way smaller room that he'll share with his brother that will BARELY fit both of them, so that her boyfriend and his kids can move in. and she's making him get rid of his computer because it won't fit. (the computer he does online college on???)

she tells him that she can't stand the sight of him or the sound of his voice. a specific example would be, there is one time he broke down and opened up to her about how harmful she's being and how she makes him feel helpless and she said ""my stomach started hurting when you got in here and it just got worse as you kept talking"" and said she couldn't stand him. 

and there's much much more. he's 19, might i add again. obviously legally he's an adult and can move out at any time he wants. but she LITERALLY makes it impossible for him to be able to get a car or keep a job in order to make money to leave. he can't live with me because i still live with my mom as well and won't be able to move out until im done with cosmetology school. is there a legal route we could take? like there's absolutely no way he can grow and be independent as an adult because she guilts and manipulates him into staying. i've run out of options on how to help him and he's reluctant to ask for outside help but i'm tired of seeing my boyfriend lose who he is and give up on life because of this abusive woman.

"my dad has a temper, and my mom puts people down. sometimes, when my dad is really mad, he gets physical. once, he pushed my 15 yr old sister and kicked her. tonight, he slammed her by her throat into a barn, then proceeded to throw her to the ground. he is 60, and a large man, so obv it hurt her. my parents say its discipline. my mother lets it happen, once throwing a brush at me, and telling all sorts of hurtful things like your fault, lose weight, be smarter, jus normal mother comments. but when we ask abt what my dad does, she said it is wrong, but it's just discipline. is she right?"
"
I live with my grandparents. My granddad keeps making very odd and sexual jokes towards me, and sometimes even touching me. It started off with him spanking me. I felt so disgusted that I cried and slapped him in the head out of anger. He immediately brushed it off, saying that what I did was overreacting. He doesn’t ever do it with anyone else. And about the sexual comments thing; today we were talking and he brought up not liking the body wash he was using, so I offered him some advice. My granddad then told me to just wash him while he wore a speedo. There were a lot more before this, including him joking about me getting pregnant. (I’m 15 btw). He also has a quick temper. My granddad grabbed my face, (I’m not over exaggerating this. He physically grabbed my face), pushing me backwards during a yelling match. I live with him so there isn’t much I can do."
"I’m about 13 weeks pregnant, when I told my mom, she immediately was overbearing saying that she wants to be a part of my very first ultrasound. I didn’t think that was appropriate and wanted that moment for my partner and I am 27 years old and I am pretty independent and make my own money. But the thing is, I sold my house about two years ago, and my parents offered for me to live in a house that was on a business property that they owned. They offered and I decided to take it and sell my house and save money regretting the situation. anytime I disagree with my parents. They immediately tried to say that they were going to kick me out and that I am ungrateful, I’m extremely grateful that they let me live here free but I also pay utilities and everything else that needs to be paid to live. But back to my ultrasound my mom flipped out and said that she doesn’t want to go anywhere she’s not wanted and made it about herself saying that my partner is manipulating me, trying to cut her out, which is not the case is it is the complete opposite it was my decision and I offered for her to come to the next one and she started saying very emotionally abusive things like saying that she’s already experienced being a grandmother. Mind you she isn’t actually a grandmother. We’ve had a couple close friends have babies that she was a part of, but they also didn’t have supportive baby daddy, my partner is the best partner through thick and thin. My partner parents are amazing and are really great people and I’m pretty close with his mom. She stopped by the house the other day to bring food and she stopped and talked to my dad saying that she’s excited for the baby and she can help with the baby whenever, when I approached my dad and asked what they talked about, he went insane. He’s jealous that I have a relationship with his mom and not mine. He was so aggressive. I thought he was going to try and attack my partner, and I had to threaten to call the police. I was hysterical hyperventilating because how severe the situation was. my parents think that I am the problem and spoiled and I’m completely in the wrong about the situation. It’s like they think my child is prize possession and just because I live in a house that they let me live in that they can treat me, however, and I have to accept it. It’s causing me severe distress and a lot of trauma of being emotionally abused my entire life. My lease is up in June and my partner, and I are trying to find a place to live. But at this point, I’ve threatened to get a restraining order if they come near me it’s crazy to me that they know I’m pregnant and can’t be under all this emotional distress. They are convinced that I am the problem.

"I'm a 24F living and coming from a middle eastern family, i left home Dec 2022 against my will because i was beaten until bled by my abusive parents and sent to the ER and was hospitalized for days, they didn't visit ofc and i didnt want them to, police were involved and they made my parents sign a report but thats all. Keep in mind this is because they found out i had a boyfriend. 

anyways i left and built a life from 0, i work and study full time now it's so hard, i pay rent and dont have a car. but would rather do that than go back. 

 they r west asians meaning super strict religious and even abusive parents, ever since i left, they would threaten me with hiring someone to follow me, or threaten to sue me or even k!ll me, i never believed them bc i know it's a tactic, i get this info from my siblings and it's draining, these threats throw me off course every time, bad anxiety, panicking, depression for days, even if i know they cant do it, it always affects me. 

sometimes they try to be nice and send money which is also a tactic, my sisters wedding is soon, and they r scared of our relatives finding out why im never on these events/gatherings. 

they offered me a car then days later threatened to sue me????? 

Anyways how do i stop getting affected and thrown out of balance everytime they play these games "

"I am in desperate need to figure out a different living situation! I have my dog with me. I have approximately 1 week mandatory I have to stay here. My dog gave birth to a litter of 9 nearly 7 weeks ago. I have been taking care of them the whole time, whole my mom complains about the smell and the mess. I was apathetic to her complaints, because it's 9 diaper-less babies, which I did my best to contain to my room and backyard. My mom has been fighting everyone in the house for 2 weeks. Last Friday in order to get revenge on her boyfriend for being mad at her for cheating, she beat his dog to near death, and now we can't find him. That dog has 2 charms with a vet number, and his number, neither have been called in a week, and no pictures on the neighborhood website. He has ""escaped"" multiple times before, but he's usually found fast. I am just now discovering that she also poisoned the litter of 9 puppies because she was mad at me for existing. I came home after work and that made her mad because she didn't want me home. She also says that maybe her house might actually be clean for once when they all die. Which scares me because me and my brother both have our dogs. She wouldn't hurt my brother's dog, he's always on her side. Once I rehome all the puppies, assuming they all live, I need to leave. 

I currently make about $450/mo, I have bipolar and this hurts my job reliability. The job I have now is the longest career I have ever kept, and it's because they are super flexible and understanding. I might get a bit more hours and raise this summer but not a lot. Also my mom ruined my credit with her stupid hearing aids. I was there when we signed for them, I can't sue her, but the hearing aids are in my name. I was 18, and just trying to help my mom out, and was proud of my near perfect credit score, but then she only made 1 single payment. I have been doing my best to pay them back, I'm 22 now, but they're expensive. Other than that I have OCD and asd. That pretty much sums up my whole situation and how I still live with my mom. I have a friend to roommate with mid summer, I need advice most particularly between them.

Please, give me the best advice you can! I might be able to roommate with my friend mid summer, a couple months away, but until then I welcome advice.
THANK YOU in advice 

*ps. If I ask questions, or explain why something won't work, I'm not trying to be dismissive, I am trying to find the best suitable option. Ideally, your advice is noted but needs to be worked out for my more specific situation. "
"I am in desperate need to figure out a different living situation! I have my dog with me. I have approximately 1 week mandatory I have to stay here. My dog gave birth to a litter of 9 nearly 7 weeks ago. I have been taking care of them the whole time, whole my mom complains about the smell and the mess. I was apathetic to her complaints, because it's 9 diaper-less babies, which I did my best to contain to my room and backyard. My mom has been fighting everyone in the house for 2 weeks. Last Friday in order to get revenge on her boyfriend for being mad at her for cheating, she beat his dog to near death, and now we can't find him. That dog has 2 charms with a vet number, and his number, neither have been called in a week, and no pictures on the neighborhood website.

"Hello everyone and by the title you can probably tell my family members are basically just shit waiting to be picked up by the garbage truck. The main perpetrator in my family is one and behold my father and his WHOLE family, yes the entire family is just passed down assholes and the only thing they're leaving behind is their shitty personalities and raising their kids as the same. Now what did my dad do? Everything, gaslight, physically abuse, mentally abuse, degrade, and suck your blood dry till you can't feel a single sense of happiness anymore. To add to that when I smile I feel as if it's fake, anything that makes me even a tad bit happy I start to question it. I have 2 older sisters and a mom which I feel terrible for but is somehow day by day turning more paranoid and is picking up some of my dads abusive personality traits. My dad is a weight that I can't get rid of, he's the type that  plays with your head and won't leave you alone till the day you die like a parasite. He hits my mother, he hits all of us basically and blames it on the fact that he's a man and when he gets tempered his blood boils and has this masculine energy burst to either choke or slap you and then gaslight you into thinking you messed up. Exactly and yes I want to push him off a cliff just as much as you want to. Omg you won't believe it there's another perpetrator, tens of them :)  The biggest one of them all is my dad's father aka my grandpa who I want to skin to death!! Yes he's another alpha male wannabe, and so are his other sons and his daughters that are like the worst people on this planet. What did my grandpa do? Gaslight my mom into kissing my dads feet and be the little cutesy housewife who would NEVER dare to raise her voice even when he husband is being a bitch. I'm going to end it here if this post goes well I'll go into the real drama because the things my dad says would never fail to make everyone's jaw drop! :) love yall  "
"so, my mother has been bitching at me about getting a job, even though i could've had one when i was in school, but she refused to let me. She told me she would throw me out with nothing, and threatened to take my door off, threatened me with assault, and has actually assaulted me, and hurt me. She also guilt trips people to make them take her side, and constantly moans and groans about everything. Any advice on what i can do?"
""
for example i said i wanted to drive then the cunt said no you can not use my car and me and my brother will misbehave but i would be the one abused verbally and physically but my brother would only get told off lmao whats this called
"I am currently living with my (former) abusive father-I bet he's not abusive anymore just because now he's older and knows nobody's gonna take care of him. He used to beat up my mum just enough to give me and her permanent scars but so it isn't visible if she put on makeup. My whole childhood I was in fear coming home to my mum being dead (great imagination). When I was 17, I had to study for exams everyday while my father was in a mental institution cause that is how he always escaped prison. I still live with my parents, and currently I am not talking with my father because all of the trauma has built up over the years and because he always blackmails me (I don't have my own car currently so everytime we fight he says I can't drive his car). I don't have problems with not talking because I resent him so much, but I am always worried about my mum and how her life is going to be once I move out. I know that is not my fault and I shouldn't worry, but over the years my mum became so important to me. What to do? What do you think about this shitty situation? How can I stop worry and take control of my feelings once I move out? Thank you all so much for reading."
My mom is emotionally abusive and controlling I finally came clean about the fraud she committed and it has resulted in 95% of my family not talking to me especially my sister and my cousin who is my best friend I don’t know what to do at this point. 
"Hi everyone! These last few weeks have been a real eye opener to my mother’s manipulation. 

I grew up in with a very abusive (emotionally and physically) mother and a father who did nothing to stop it. We came from Mexico when my mom married my father and he adopted us, so up until a few years ago, I always have carried this idea that my father was my hero because he rescued us. On the flip side, my mother has always been the devil. She would constantly yell at us saying we weren’t good enough, we were shitty kids and that we should be embarrassed because we were wastes of money and time. 

At one point growing up, my little brother told his teacher about my mom hitting us and CPS got involved but nothing came of it because my parents coached us on what to say and because my dad had a great and upstanding career in the military, it went nowhere. 

I vividly remember my mother dragging my little brother to the tub and holding his head under the water. My psych eventually reframed that as attempted murder and my mind was blown. Anyway, there are so many other stories about how she would hit us, degrade us, and isolated us from all the family we had in Mexico and I always believed it was my fault. She even slapped me in the face when I was 9m pregnant with my son because I wouldn’t turn the heat up and she was cold. Funny enough, my water broke after an argument with her that day.

I’ve been in therapy since 2014, and it’s made SUCH a difference. She was so kind and understanding and helped me process so much. First: none of this was my fault. While it seems so easy and obvious, that’s something I have to tell myself everyday. Second: my father is no white knight. Whenever my mom would start hitting me, I’d run behind him for protection but he wouldn’t do anything, he’d just sit there and keep reading the newspaper. He only cared about our grades, accolades, and what sports we were doing. Three: my mom has BPD. This was probably the biggest nugget because her behavior was a text book example. The whole, I love you, I hate you, you’re not going anywhere. 

Anyway, fast forward to now: contact with them is very limited, and the only reason my mom reached out this year is because she needed help with her homework…and by that, she wanted me to do it. Well, I set my foot down two weeks ago, and I told my dad that if she needed this much help, she needed a tutor or switch majors. He said alright, and I have not heard from them since.

I’m sorry if it’s all over the place, I’ve just never written all of this out and it opens up a lot of wounds. I have 3 wonderful children and a loving husband, and I literally wouldn’t even dream of treating my kids the way my mother did to me. They are loved, nurtured, safe and secure ❤️"
"My dad was incredibly abusive to me ant my mom. He wasn't always that way. He used to be kind and I used to be excited to see him home from work when I was a kid. That kind man died when I was 14 or 16 when he turned into an alcoholic and opiate addict... or rather, got back into his old habits from before I was even born.   He became verbally and physically abusive. He was even abusive to me after a drunk driver nearly killed me, saying it was my fault and I never should have been out that late. He stole my Hydrocodone while I was bedbound and was in extreme pain from a displaced sternum and multiple other injuries. That was when I decided that I hated him. 

After I recovered and got a good paying job, a small inheritance from my grandfather,  i moved out. Shortly thereafter he received a pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis and began to decline and he became more reserved and subdued. Especially after the double lung transplant. 2 years later, he died of a stroke or heart attack from a blood clot. He never apologized. He never attempted to reconcile even though I branched out to him.

 This was recent and I felt like I haven't been mourning his loss because I already did so long ago. 

However, I've been having dreams. It's how I remember him looking from before he was sick, and before he began to abuse substances. I'll feel the excitement that my dad's home and we'll eat zebra cakes, play cards or chess together, and go fishing in the morning,  or build a computer together. I actually smiled and sat by him. 

I woke up crying. I hate that he died the man he became and we were never able to reconcile... I miss the man he was before substance abuse. "
"Ok so I (18f) was adopted with my twin brother when we were little like 16 months, into a super religious household with a older sister. The encouraged sibling rivalry was also insane growing up, my parents literally pitted up against each other and shit. Got pissed whenever we switched on each other, but got suspicious and accusative whenever we didn't. Then 3 years later comes my little sis, I think she was like some sort of miracle baby or sum cuz of how much they (my parents) baby her. She's got one of the worst cases of spoiled sibling baby of the family entitlement shit u've ever seen. My parents never treated me and my brother the same. Little sis constantly got shit that me and my brother didn't, she got all the awesome birthdays and gifts, while my brother and I got cast offs. Literally. My, what was, favorite gift for Christmas of a MP3 player turned out to be a promo addition of one of my sister's gifts. It really broke me finding that out. But I always found shit out, the minute I shut up, I became invisible, so I used to my advantage, cuz around there, u talked to much u pissed dad off and got hit, it got better throughout the years after my older sis reported him to CPS, but I was too young and afraid of my father to speak out against him. Maybe if I had, we would have been able to escape that house, all of us. But none of us said she so she was written off as a troublemaker and nothing happened, my dad always had the saying that ""it was good that we were scared of him, maybe that way we wouldn't disobey him"" as I got older I started to realize that shit wasn't normal there, but every time I tried to get CPS involved, nobody said anything against him. So I was was written off as an attention seeking troublemaker. So instead I gave up and just ranted to my friends instead. In order to protect my siblings i would act out to keep dads attention on me, so he would hit me the most. I just recently moved out, now I'm living with my bf, and my ""dad"" is shunning me until I stop ""living in sin"". Coming up is the end of the school year in which one of my favorite cousins always throws a party,  I'm worried they might misconstruct everything and make me out to be the bad guy, so do I let them all know before they have the chance? (P.S. this is just the parental abuse, not to mention the torture my little sister put me through that my parents didn't give a fuck about or my brother literally trying to kill me multiple time and then telling people I tried to kill him)"
"I got out of my adoptive parents grasp after they tried to get me to break up with my fiance at 26, saying I needed to focus on family and my ""responsibilities"" I wasn't allowed to drive, date or even have friends loving with them. It got physical and I got a Domestic Violence Protection order against her. I got out and that was in November.
I am now living with my fiancé, I have a car, our own apartment, even my dream dog (a corgi), he works while I stay home and he provides everything. 
I couldn't have had these experiences staying with that family as I was paying her 800 in rent while also spending 300 every month on her animals as well as using credit cards on HER animals and I had to pay on them too. 
I'm so glad I got out. If anyone has any similar situations let me know."
My mother  beat me in the shower a few times growing up. Once or twice out of no where . Sometimes with a broom stick. Once with the shower head. It wasn't an everyday day things and tbh I thought all kids were getting whooped just like me and that I was depressed because somthing was wrong with me. Did anybody else ever deal with things like that growing up?
"I've moved before, but both times, it was a pyrrhic victory at best, because I had to end up moving back, and I ended up being miserable with my new living situation. This time, I have to keep paying her back for the car on top of paying for rent at my new place and whatever other essentials. Hopefully, I can land a job that'll pay me well enough to balance everything out, but I'm still not used to this notion of freedom. I've caught myself wanting to feel loved — truly loved — by her, which I thought I'd long ago given up on."
"I don’t exactly know how to do this but I definitely don’t want to talk to my family as if they act like their mine. I’m a young adult in a Indian household so if you get the gist they are strict and religious I’m the older f 21 and I realize or more or less came to terms with the fact my family hates me and does not prioritize me at all let alone love me. 

Any sort of problem I have with them resulting my life with boyfriends wanting to be my own person could never happened i today started talking about an issue with my parents about how I need a new laptop where it just does not fiction and I called it cheap and old and I tried everything in my power to make this shitty hp laptop last name it I tried it. My mom spirals to say you don’t have a job if you saved your money you could have gotten one then my dad chimes in to say how stupid and every name of the book I can think of for the lack of Intel ago ve I have but lastly my younger sister in uni shits on me too because the conversation somehow involved her when she did not need to put in her two cents. And it got all the way to the point where every end conversation is why don’t I ever buy my self all the important stuff and why am I not prepared to buy my own necessities. 

I thought it be fine to ask my parents for a laptop since they got my sister one bit too long ago not ti mention a lily lemon bag and they shit on me for not paying my own bus fares or for my computer because I’m an adult who should have money which I get but I got let go from my job because they still blame me otherwise all the way too saying how the rent money she charges me was to help me and my spending habits and not to help them even though that what they told me at the beginning.

This over all ended to my mom having an ego trip saying that there are more people that pay more and go to school and I have a month too move out and I have a month too get a job or move out. I know this sorry doesn’t make sense and I’m sounding all over the place but I worked country sleepless nights this weeks to prioritize my school so I could pass my first semester. They always said if I have issues to come to them for help but all I got was shit on and there’s even worse causes with my parents and my space or me dealing with boys and all I can do right now is not help but cry and wish to have a fiend that understands me or like advice but I think the number one thing I was is for a family that cares about me and or loves me enough not to insult me and which me luck for school or to value how my day is and not give me shitty a five to tell me how stupid I am maybe I’ll find love somewhere one day but m it with my family or with a partner man I want a hug rn anyway to anyone that gone this far to read this thanks for hearing me out I hope y’all have a nice day ."
"(TW mentions of suicide and threats) I’m usually left alone while my mom goes to school but im always too depressed to get out of bed every-time I hear the door open when she gets home I get hit with dread because I know she is going to immediately start to complain about how the place is a mess and if I defend myself I am always bombarded with insults, and if we get into a argument she threatens to leave me harm me or tells me to get out of her house (I’m 16), she knows I am severely depressed and while writing this she has told me that she hates me and that she wished I succeeded in my suicide attempt back in 2020, and every-time I call her out she denies it and tells me that I do that to her and how I make her life miserable, she has told me multiple times to go to hell and has straight up told me to kms. The house is extremely nasty and borderline infested with roaches and she blames it all on me. I don’t want to call her abusive but at this point I don’t think I can think her actions are just stress related anymore im unsure if my post will be taken down though I didn’t see anything in the rules about it, but I just want an answer I feel like I’m being gaslighted."

Hii! I was told to post here. Thanks for noticing my thread. :)
I’m sorry if this is a wrong place to post this ;w;

[tw:   child abuse, fraud, self harm, sexual harassment]

𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝: I grew up in Malaysia and attended college there before they made me drop out and migrated me to Indonesia, their home country. I am working an online part-time job as a teacher to save up. My parents and extended family has always been controlling about small and big things, from the colour of clothes I wear daily (they’re not skimpy at all) to trying to put a wedge between my friends, my exes and my current s.o. Even my boss, for insisting that he wires my salary to me. When they knew they couldn’t coax the boss, they wrote a letter impersonating me and forged my signature. They cut me off of people they can’t control basically. I believe they care about me and want to stop me from dangerous people, and yet they blamed me when a guy they were shipping me with and another teacher tried to sexually harass me, and told me I was lucky that some people, relatives whatsoever, like to fondle with my thighs and my ass. They constantly blame the people in my life for ruining our family relationship and label my friends and s.o. as “manipulative”. It was hard to see as the abuse was mostly emotional. There were instances of physical violence too -grabbing my wrist and spraining it and bruising my thigh- I don’t know if it was intentional…. nevertheless, I was going down the deep end, self harming daily, sometimes several times a day, and close to deleting myself from life.

𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: I’m turning 18 this November and I’ve been planning to move out since the first year of highschool, and I’ve worked a stable online teaching part-time job. I have recently created my own bank account and have a decent amount of money saved. It isn’t as much as I initially expected because my parents confiscated my year-worth of salary. Another finance worry aside from college, I researched but I have no idea how insurance and taxes work. 

I am uneasy because they are forcing me to resign once I start college in Indonesia in September. My boss was understanding and we previously discussed about having me on leave until I can stably move out and continue my job. I’m still worried that things will go wrong and I end up moving out with nowhere to go. I looked up housings and asked a friend’s mom whose job is a housing agent and found out I need my Identification card to rent a house / room. However, I can’t physically survey them yet since they have me locked in the house, only going out for church with their tight supervision. I’m still thinking if I need to relocate to a different city in case my family ends up finding me… the thought of what they’ll do terrifies me.

It will be in the first semester of college when I move out, hence, there’s a chance I’ll be in the dorms during the weekdays. I just gotta have my identifications with me, either by sneaking it out when I visit home for birthday, or with a civil standby. Currently, I have my Identification card with me. My birth certificate, high schools  graduate certification, and passports are withheld but I know the location, provided they don’t move it. I found out from my Indonesian friend that I can phone the cops to come as a civil standby in case any violence happens.

___
and I always loved my family and thus I’ve tried reasoning a lot with myself, asking if I’m just being a bad daughter? That maybe if I studied more and get that A* and not just an A or B, or if I am a bit more perfect like they asked of me, they’d love me as I am? I guess my parents thought they were right as they mentioned they were raised that way too. I hate to admit it but I feel guilty moving out since my parents and extended family are now unemployed. Of course there were happy glimpse, but lots of things they did and are doing doesn’t sit right and I feel like I’m about to lose it everyday. Many told me to get out and not look back, and I came to terms that it’s for the best. It’s still one scary thing to think about though :(

𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐝, 𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞~: Thus, if I may, I’m asking:
1. advice about successfully moving out in Indonesia; opinions from any countries are appreciated too! 
2. what are the things that could go wrong and I should watch out for.
3. any other thoughts / your story that you wanna share :3

If you’re still here, thank you for staying and reading my lengthy blog, and may heavens bless you with a cute kitten / puppy / any animal you like. Take care~ •w•"
"so my previously abusive family are now helping me our with my daughter (5months) because im doing it solo right now. i moved back in with my dad about a year ago a couple months after i found out i was pregnant. 
lately, there has been some discussion about my independency which i find odd because i left home in 2020 and barely came back until last year because of the toxicity. it wasn't until i literally ran out of the house with my belongings, that the family decided to take what i have to say seriously (i was usually the scapegoat). anyways, i find it hilarious when my dad or sister or anyone else tries to insinuate i don't know how to be independent (aka never asking for help and choosing to struggle when there are better options which is such a heavy heavy poverty and lack mindset imo). call it entitlement but i think they should think to themselves how shitty they were to me growing up, and be thankful i have chose to let the pain go and not seek revenge or pettiness 😂😂 
anyways, i am grateful for them slowly changing their ways. im using the abuse i faced as a catalyst for a better life for me and my LO. "
"Up until a few weeks ago, I thought my only real parental problems were with my biological father, who was physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my brother until he cut me off on my 13th birthday for being gay. Now, here I am, eight years after losing one shitty parent, having to make the choice to cut off the other. 

My mom's an alcoholic. She started drinking heavily when I was in middle school. She went to rehab, and she really seemed like she got better. She relapsed for the first time when I was just starting high school. She relapsed for the second time when I was about to graduate high school. She relapsed for the third time three weeks ago. Shockingly, the alcoholism is far from the main reason I have for cutting her off, but it's what made me realize a pattern of behavior for her. 

My mom is a very selfish, narcissistic woman. I love her, I do, but everything, my whole life, has always been about her, or about my brother, her favorite child. I have no ill will towards my brother, he's one of my best friends. He had a lot of open struggles with mental illness growing up, and all of my mom's (however performative) support was focused on the child who ""needed it."" I've always been the easy kid, the quiet one, the responsible, well adjusted, mature one. I learned from a really young age that trying to talk about my struggles wouldn't do anything anyways. It would always turn into my mom crying about being a horrible mother and a failure of a parent because how could she have *two* depressed children? 

She called me, the other week, at 3:30pm on a work day. I work evenings, so I was only about two hours into my shift. She decided that was the perfect time to drop the bomb that she relapsed. The whole phonecall was full of her saying ""*I* wanted"", ""*I* needed"", ""*I* felt."" Not caring that I was at work, not caring at all how this would make me feel to hear, knowing that I'd have to go back to work and pretend everything is fine for six more hours. It made me realize she never really cared, at all. As long as it was what she wanted, what she needed, how it made me feel never mattered. I haven't spoken to her since that phone call. 

Now I'm sitting here, at what is currently 2:31am on a work night, sick to my stomach from crying all day, thinking how much easier it all would've been for everyone if I wasn't born at all. Never seemed to make much of a difference to my parents. At least I've got my aunt and my stepdad. Sorry for the novel, feeling a lot of things right now. "
"Since I'm seeing so many posts in rant-format, I'll try to keep this short.

Girlfriend is 42. Her mother is mid 60's, from what I can tell she is a clinical narcissist and possibly bipolar. She forced her way into living with my girlfriend as she has nowhere to go and burned all her bridges. Raised to believe everything goes her way, she says absolutely horrible things to my girlfriend and will not take any kind of criticism. I could go on and on about the crazy. 

The tricky part, she says ""I'm not going anywhere I will live here if I want and you can't tell me otherwise"" in spanish but it's going to bring my girlfriend to s***ide. My emails to social services requesting advice go unanswered. I don't know what our options or resources are. There's no family or friends that would take her and she's not going anywhere without a fight. My girlfriends kids hide in their rooms 24/7 because she is so unbearable. 

What in the world can I even do? I have no idea where to turn. "
"TW sibling r*pe.
 I escaped my parents at 16 because my mother’s son (he does not deserve the b word) Rred me for several years. I lived for a decade at my grandparents until in late 2016 early 2017, I had a breakdown. I contacted the NSPCC because I was scared my Rist would have access to children. They called the rozzer’s and I had to write my parents a letter explaining everything. They did not take it well. My mother especially called me a liar and says I traumatised him with the cops. I’ve managed to explain to my dad that I’m Pan and Non Binary and he understands but he’s still married to mother. She’s manipulated me for years; when I lived with her when she was drunk (which was every night) if we didn’t bow down to her she’d pretend to run away (she’d drive the car around the corner) but she drove drunk. She said if we didn’t eat the mountain of food on our plates she would never cook for us again. I’ve tried going No contact but she finds a way to bash in. My relationship with my Dad is getting better but my mother is a toxic psychopath along with her son"
"Hello, I just don’t know what to do. My mom’s being shouting at me since afternoon. She saw a vid in my phone of ke vaping. I do not vape/smoke or anything. I just saw it in my house, it was my brother’s n just made a snap yk. She’s not listening to me and have being snapping at me n shoutingg. I have being crying since afternoon now even my eyes hurt but she doesn’t believe me. (Not crying infront of her)."
"Them not trying at all to get a hold of you , or doing everything in their power to try to communicate with you ? "
"A rather random question, I guess, but I find it interesting: Has the abuse you experience affected at all what media you consume? Like what kind of music, what kind of movies, what kind of video games, etc.?

For me I think it has very much predisposed me to enjoying heavy, moody and emotional music like Breaking Benjamin, Evanescence and Linkin Park.

And for like TV-series, video games, again, I think it has predisposed me to heavily emotional, darker, etc. stuff.

Like two of my favourite video games are ""Halo: CE"" and ""Bioshock Infinite.""

That first one may seem a little bit odd to people who don't know much about Halo because it's a shooter, not exactly a super emotional personal story. But the thing about it is that Halo really deals with being isolated on this mysterious ring, in a completely unwinnable and hopeless fight and fighting on anyway in the face of hopelessness and isolation. And I think that really resonates with me.

And then Bioshock Infinite, without talking about spoilers, I'd say it has one of the most emotional and one of the darkest relationship between two main characters out there.

So, yeah, I think the abuse tends to have made my taste in media very emotional, very dramatic, very dark and very much aimed at stuff like isolation, connection, hope and hopelessness, etc."
"Do I need to forgive my mom if she is verbally & physically abusive towards my dad ? I guess blood is thicker than water , so I want to forgive & go back to having a  relationship with her.  I also keep thinking I am not a perfect human & I've my share of hurting others so why not forgive another human   
 I also can't help but keep going back to the question how I'd have reacted if the genders were reversed  in the abuse ? I'm at my mid point in life 33.5 years, its emotionally draining tbh."
"AITAH?
ok, so my husband knows this person (we will call her Karen) well Karen was in a relationship with the father of her two children for 14+ yrs. About 6 months ago she left him over him Abusing their son whom is 14. I told her I'd help her however we could but that I'm on SSI and financially I'm not able to do alot. Well move along to the 1st of April. She knows I have trouble saying no to people due to childhood trauma and past DV issues with exes (reason I wanted to help her in the first place) well this girl orders $80+ at one fast food place and $50+ at another ON MY CARD and GRABS MY CARD AND HANDS IT TO THE PERSON IN THE WINDOW BEFORE I CAN SPEAK 😭 She then proceeded to put $35 in her gas tank and spent money in the gas station on whatever too😭 knowing I have fears of getting hurt for saying no. Well, I decided to try standing up for myself for once and she goes crazy on me and even has the nerve to say she's not paying me back and if I tell anyone they won't believe me, she called me out of my name (here's the kicker that really hurt) and sent a photo of her with the man that has abused her son for 11+ years. I am worried about the kids at this point and don't think they're safe. Was I wrong to call CPS and notify them there was RECENTLY a protective order against the father, the son testified in court about the abuse, and now Karen is allowing father around them? I'm honestly concerned because the man is violent and destroyed the last home they were in like DESTROYED it and she still let him back around the kids. She said if I reported it that she would press charges on me. She also said that if I said anything about the situation no one would believe me because I'm the R word (I'm autistic and fully disabled) "
"This is a long shot, but looking for someone who maybe has had a similar experience and can help…
About a year ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He is very active and the energy draining medication he was on and the impact it had on his ability to be active took a big hit to his mental health. 
My dad has always had issues with mental health (anger management, narcissism, depression), but he was a fairly well-liked, functional member of society. Flash forward to one year later, he’s been in prison twice now for stalking my mother (she left him after 6 months of giving up everything to try and help his mental health and sacrificing hers in the process, including when he pushed her down the stairs and threatened to hit her with a baseball bat), he’s destroyed our family home (broken all the windows, destroyed all the photo albums), he’s lost all his friends and family (the last time I talked to him was three months ago after he called me on repeat for three hours straight resulting in me having 145 missed calls from him).
Can someone please tell me what could have caused this? And if there is anything we can do? I’ve lost all hope my dad will ever get better and I assume he will be homeless soon. 
Thanks"
"So I live in an abusive household, nothing has ever been fixed, when I tried getting help the cps case worker said they understood because I’m special needs and I’m lying. But it has been an issue with my older sister too, but my older sister isn’t special needs. And nobody will believe me, because I lie sometimes but not about my home situation. My mom threatens me all the time, the cops have been called multiple times and everyone I went to church with doesn’t like her and knows she’s abusive. 

But she wanted to choke me because I laughed when she was yelling at me, and I know she has enough power to end my life, she’s mean and abusive and she always calls me worthless and so on. "
"for context i (22f) live with my mom and my stepdad. i’ve always had a good-ish relationship with both of them, but i’m finding a pattern of my mother going into what i call “episodes” where she doesn’t consult anyone and buys/sells something that effects all of us. this pattern has been with compulsively buying a dog (we have three now, i love all of them) but goes out of town a lot so i have to take care of them. one day i came home from school and saw my car had been sold by her, and she said that i can just use hers (which i do). and now it’s buying a new home, we moved during covid so i changed what college i was going to. there has been many other things but now we’re moving again apparently, and i am in my final year of college, i am a education student so where i was placed for my student teaching will now have to be changed, and i will need to find a new job when the one i have right now is perfect for me and my career. is this abuse? am i overreacting for being upset with her ? i tell myself i should be grateful that i am able to live with my parents rent free while i focus on school, but this is causing an extra stressor because now i’m looking to move out, but with student teaching that will be my full time job (unpaid, appreciate you’re teachers!) so i don’t know how i will be able to afford to live on my own.

"My dad keeps touching me without me wanting him to. Not anywhere inappropriate but I can't do it anymore. I've tried to tell him and he just says that he has to because he's my dad. He's also been trying to push me into a religion again and he gets mad at me when I don't want to talk about it. When I breakdown from sensory stuff or angsity I get my electronics taken away.

"My father and mother found me texting people in a phase I wasn't supposed to. I had been through abuse a few days ago due to my parents finding out abt my relationship and my friends wanted to check upon me, hence I was replying to texts. My father says ""You can kiss your boyfriend comfortably but when I open the door on you changing clothes by accident, you start crying and call me a bad guy."" I really don't know how I should perceive my dad after this. Aren't the both a completely different dynamics? What the hell?"

"I moved across the country from my parents, my roommate are great, i’m doing okay with school and work. I’ve been here for a few months and have a nice routine but I still can’t get my head around that this is my new normal. I still think i’m gonna have to go back, or that i’ll wake up and everything was a dream. Or my roommates will kick me out (even though I know that isn’t going to happen) but I can’t stop planning an escape but i’ve already escaped

when does this end?"

"Exactly as the title says. I'm using an anonymous account, because I am too ashamed.

I'm living with my parents, and they (especially my mother) believe I'm not able to fend for myself, and be a top student like many of mine or my family's acquaintances. She is forcing my study schedule, she is forcing me to study for the exams I haven't passed from last year, even though I have to study for the upcoming finals as well. She always comes into my room under different pretexts, when I ask her why, she says it's her right. My dad agrees with her, at times. 

A few days ago, she also checked out my Whatsapp messages when I showed her some proof for enlisting in some workshop event organized by my college. My phone is secured, fingerprint and all that, yet she broke my privacy at first opportunity. She even had the audacity to tell me that my phone shouldn't be secured, and my dad agreed with her. She saw that I was contacted by a scammer, to which I haven't replied, but she started getting insane anyways. She has also forced me to install a family locator app (Life360 to be exact) when I was in senior year of HS, because she thought I wasn't going to take my graduation exam, but she also uses the excuse that ""she could see me when I am in trouble"" and her colleagues are using it for their children (one of them saved her daughter from being r\*ped).  She compares herself to her boisterous colleagues almost every day, and she wishes she could praise me as much as they do with their teenage or college-aged offsprings (and that includes former classmates of mine from HS or middle school, present-day colleagues from uni, and even my cousins!). It doesn't help that when I went yesterday for a lab, I did the most idiotic things, that only a person in need of psychiatric help would do.

They both think I'm mentally ill, and bringing them shame due to my failures. They also think I'm a burden, they generally treat me worse than a kid, including the time when I was an *actual* kid. They haven't beaten me at all (or very rarely) when I was that age, especially with the belt. But she started doing it a few months ago, and now I have trauma and flashing images whenever I see a belt 

The first thought would be ""why am I not leaving from their house?"". Well, in order for me to be accepted into a dorm, I'd have to live in an area that is not under the immediate conscription of my city (which is impossible since I'm living in the city itself), and I can't get a job because of my college schedule, so no rent for me either. I wanted to leave to another city/another country when I graduated from HS, but didn't have the money and the grades (it's still a frustration to this day, I wanted to leave for other reasons as well, besides my family).

"How has your parents’ abuse affected your academic performance?

I remember when I was 14 and my parents split, they were screaming and offending each other the entire day. My father was keeping us awake for an entire week, police came several times, he said he was gonna kill himself, he was screaming all night and terrorizing us until the police was called at the end after he started threatening to murder my mom in the middle of the night. He moved to another country afterwards. I had to miss an entire school week because I was too exhausted and scared to sleep during all of this. When I got back to school, I got screamed at by my teacher who accused me to skip school and being “irresponsible and childish”. My mother and her entire family told me to not say anything related to their divorce at school, so I kept my mouth shut.

Years have passed since then and I am attending a new school now since last year. But more recently, I can’t focus at all, I have constant brain fog. Each time I hear the voice of my abusive and neglectful mother, it kills every thought that was forming in my head. Hearing her is always bad news. The only reasons she talks to me are to either complain or scream and guilt trip me over everything. Sometimes, she starts fights out of nowhere and starts screaming at me (I usually just break down and try not to cry because I can’t handle people screaming). It takes so much time and effort that I can’t even manage to properly do my homework sometimes.

Also, I just recently came the realisation that I have several traumas, which for some reason are coming to the surface right now and are impacting me pretty badly. Most of them are because of my “great” upbringing (seriously, my mom brags about her parenting skills and even goes into detail to explain why they are superior). I can’t even manage to get therapy. I am still having a rough time, I feel completely empty, even though I am trying to distract myself from my inner state.

Recently, I got back my math exam, and I was devastated. I used to be an A student up until 2 months ago, and now I am afraid if I am gonna get a failing grade. My teacher showed dissapointment, he told me that “I could do better” and that “It is a pity”. Teachers’ opinions matter a lot to me, so it hit me like a rock. I am actually still debating with myself if I should at least tell him that I am having problems outside of school which impacted my performance recently, while also offering him to do some extra work.

"Long story short my parents tried to claim that the abuse (SA physical emotional) was a result of our Norwegian culture.  They go on to say they provided for us giving us everything we actually needed just as God has. 

When they were initially confronted they adamantly denied any of the abuse whatsoever fell back on religion telling us that were horrible Christian’s and going straight to hell if we don’t forgive and repent. They’ve since admitted to lesser instances of the actual abuse that took place yet they still think that they are somehow next to god and use religion to manipulate their adult children. 

Religion is solely a tool for them to justify their abuse and is the reason I can’t step foot in a church today"
hi guys i just the time when me my brother and mom were walking home from school and my mom told my brother to pick up a stick from the floor then made me strip naked and beat me with it until i had lashes in my skin and couldnt walk properly for about a week when i was 7 just came in my mind and ive been uncontrollably crying ever since :) lol im 16 now i dunno why i just thought of that thr brain is so mysterious lol
"Over time I've realized there's a deep hollowness inside of me. A darkness that swallows everything up. A hurt that never truly goes away, it can only be treated (and that's only when I find someone I'm in romantic love with who seems to love me back).

I can't be sure where this hollowness comes from. But I suspect it's due to my parents' emotional abuse.

To be clear, the abuse I experienced is actually pretty tame compared to a lot of other people here have experienced, I think. I still sometimes question myself on whether I should call it abuse at all. But based on the articles I've read about the topic, it seems that it probably was.

Anyway, I guess I'm asking about: How many of you feel the same way? Where there's like an underlying pain or hollowness that you can't ever quite get rid of. You can only find ways to temporarily soothe it."

I struggle with a lot of things because I was never properly taught them and neglected/stunted in that way. I remember how my mom would take me to the doctor and stay in the room with me up until I was 17 because I told her I didn’t want her to (and before her reason was because she legally had to go back with me which isn’t true). She’d always speak for me. I was never able to get a word out. Never able to speak to the doctor alone about my health concerns.

"I had been getting abused by my dads ex wife
Here is some back story my mom had me when she was 17 my dad was not a good person he kept a guy under his pillow at night when I was a baby, he also has threatened my life and hers then my grandparents got us away from him. My mom got on drugs and she had split custody with my dad and his now ex wife. I ended up getting put into dcf custody at the age of 6 I think and then put me with this family for a couple days, then I was put with my dads mom she put me in school I don’t remember what happened during that time except when I ran away from school and I was saying how I wanted to hurt myself and others I was 9 at this time so I went to a mental hospital I don’t remember how long I was there but when I got out then put me in a group home for troubled kids I was there for a while. After that I was put in a foster home which I really liked. Then I went to live with my dad and his now ex wife I was living with then for a while then my dad got onto drugs and was abusive to her so she divorced him and she got custody of me and my 2 younger brothers when we started to grow up I was getting treated differently then my brothers I would get into trouble for the littlest things and be grounded for months and they would do worse things then me and be grounded for a hour at most and everything went downhill from there she would leave bruises on my arms and throw things at me and she put me back into the mental health for 4 weeks and I kept saying I didn’t want to go back because I knew it would be worse and it was. She ended up getting a boyfriend who has a kid and she treated him better than she treated me even after they broke up. I have been kicked out of there because I called the cops on her for her abuse.

"Is it normal for you to get punished by your parents over some things(that might be little) ?
(Sorry if my grammar is bad, English is not my first language.)
Today, my mom get mad at me for turning on air conditioner.
It start like this, I was a little bit annoyed about something and make a face without knowing, I entered the living room where my mother and other family members was sitting and say something like ""It's hot, will turn on the air conditioner"" and I grabbed the remote and point it to the air conditioner. My mom looked at me and started insulting me, calling me name and stuff, I thought that she was mad at me for something else, so I opened the turn on the air conditioner and sit down next to her feet, and she used her feet to kick me away and say something like ""You're not my daughter, go away."" And so I looked at her, a little confused. I sat there for a minutes before I stood up and walked out of the room but she call me back in, and then she slapped me on my arm 2 times and 1 time on my face, she also pinch my arm really hard that it leave some bruises. I started crying and tried to leave the room 2 times but she would dragged me back in and lecture me. She was mad at me for turning on the air conditioner, my grandma(who is almost completely deaf and was sitting far away) lecture me too but I don't think she even know what happened. In the end, I managed to leave the room and sit alone outside.
What do you think? Do you think what I did was really that bad? Do you experience the same thing?"
"I have posted before about my dad being a narc and had loads of other mental health. We don't have a good relationship and I actually do hate him. 

Anyway I'm (22) living at home with my father. He had a very weird view that I should be grateful for him and he can treat me anyway he pleases because he's my dad and he's the authority figure. He has absolutely no respect for me but demands I treat him with the upmost respect. Due to my personality I don't take his shit, I challenge him back, I won't let him speak to me like shit and when I set a boundary, it's over my dead body will he break it (although he try's to break them every single day) my dad currently doesn't work, he's on benefits due to his mental health and it meant I became a young career, has the years have went on I've released the whole ""young career"" wasn't in fact what I was, my dad just gave me parent responsibility and stresses from about the age of 12. That includes , cleaning (he is a messy person so I have to clean up after him 24/7) cooking my meals and his, financial burdens, his mental health dumps etc. 

I recently mentioned how it would be nice to get a new cooker and fridge freezer (I never said I was going to, just mentioned that it would be nice) he took it upon himself to go buy a new fridge freezer ( never told me he was doing it or how much ) the fridge freezer he bought was 1k and is claiming I owe £500 of it (so half), basically putting me into £500 debt without my knowledge or agreement. I absolutely refuse to give him the money, it has caused crazy amounts of arguments and I tell him I'm on a budget and I can't afford to lose £500, he then goes on to tell me I can pay it back £50 a month.... is he joking? When I refused this as well he then started saying, the only reason you aren't willing to pay for half is because ""I'm up to my eyes in debt"" which is not true at all. He said that because I use the fridge freezer then I have added to the deterioration of it and that's why I need to pay half ( please bare in mind 1 the fridge freezer wasn't even broke and didn't need replacing 2 I moved in with my dad when I was 12 years old , that's how long we have had it, I was a child)  I feel like when its a parents house it's on them to pay for the up keep of their own house and that includes appliances  ( I plan on moving out this year) so I'm paying £500 for a fridge freezer that he will then keep for the next 10 years?? It doesn't make sense. He believes this should be the case if anything needs to be replaced in the  house , carpets, cookers, washing machines etc ... 

I did mention he was on benefits but I can assure you he's got no shortage of money when it comes to buying things for himself or his hobbies. 

I'm happy to accept if my thinking is wrong and he is in the right but it just doesn't sit well with me "
"
Hello, 3 years ago my family and I moved into a duplex. The neighboring family consist of a couple and their 4 kids. The parents are probably like 40, but they could fool me. They look like they’ve been on drugs for decades. I’ve had my experience with druggies and some of the interactions I’ve had with them made it very clear to me they’re on something. 

Their oldest son is 19, I’ll call him Aaron. 
Second oldest seems middle school age, I’ll call her Sarah. 
Then there’s two little ones, young elementary age for sure. 

Due to the fact that our houses are basically glued together, I can overhear a TON of fighting going on in there. Usually with Aaron and the parents or Aaron and Sarah. Some of the stuff I’ve overheard is really brutal. 

There will be times where I don’t hear/see the parents for days. Their car is usually gone during these times. Which leads me to believe they are just abandoning their kids and leaving Aaron to take care of them. He goes to work during the day, so who’s taking care of them then? The middle schooler? No one? 

There’s been a couple times I’ve tried to go over there to check it out when I think the two little kids are alone. Just to make sure they’re okay and see what’s happening. They never answer the door, which I understand. I’ve taught my kids to not answer for anyone as well. But I just really want to find out what’s going on and honestly I’m curious to see the state of that house on the inside. 

Nosiness aside, 

I’ve talked to Aaron a handful of times. He looks fully worn out. Constant fighting is exhausting enough, but then being abandoned to take care of your siblings? Who knows if the parents even take care of the children when they ARE around. 

I’ve told my kids to steer clear of them. I do not want my children ever interacting with their parents. 

My heart aches for those kids. Aaron shouldn’t have to be a father to them. They should be in a stable, loving home.

The obvious answer is to call CPS. But I know this can also open up a whole new can of awful things for the kids. Being separated/ worse homes. My thought was that this would be taking Aaron out of his Fiona Gallagher nightmare, but my wife thinks there might be a reason why he *hasnt* called CPS on his own yet. She has a point. I need input about this.  "
"help please. i’m 15 years old and im experiencing abuse from my parents, about half an hour ago i experienced a very scary situation with my dad. my parents and i are usually very close but whenever they had mad it gets really bad. me and my father were watching a movie like normal and then he spiraled. i started talking to him but he didn’t like the way my voice sounded (sometimes it gets high pitched due to puberty voice crack, etc) so he started drilling his finger into one of the sides of my skull. i told him to stop but he wouldn’t until i hit him in the stomach, he then started aggressively grabbing and gripping my body, specifically my arms and chest, i still have red marks and bruises from how hard he was doing it. when i managed to pull myself away i told him that what he did was child abuse and that it was an offense. he then proceeded to say these exact words to me, “if you ever call the cops, the day you call the cops on me, they’ll find nothing but a corpse.” by this point i was really scared, this wasn’t the dad that i knew, he would never have said anything like this. i tried to confront him to repeat that while holding my phone out, trying to record it, he obviously didn’t repeat it into the recording but instead said that i was the one who said that phrase. i then put it down and told him that if he knew what he just did, and what he said. i told him that people have ruined their whole lives saying that, have gone to prison and everything. he then got mad and grabbed me again aggressive, this time pulling out his phone and typing 911 into the dial of his phone, he held it out in front of me while grabbing and hitting me and told me to call the cops if i wanted, he was yelling at me to call them. i yelled stop and what was he was doing, i asked him to realize what he was doing. he then put his phone down and started punching, pulling, grabbing, gripping, and kicking me. all simultaneously while yelling at me, i don’t remember much of what he was saying, i was in shock, i’m sure he was just repeating the same thing over and over about calling the cops and about making me ruin his life. i also remember him yelling to call my mom (they’re divorced) to pick me up to take me to her house, but she’s working so that didn’t work out. i told him that i never stopped the recording on my phone and that it caught all of that, which was a bluff, he finally stopped. he then started searching for my phone, probably to destroy it. i had hid it under the sheets so despite all that he looked he couldn’t find it, i told him to just leave the room and he finally did. after that i was really scared and tried texting my mom, i told her everything that happened and she blamed it on me. she said it was my fault and that i provoked him, that it’s because of my behavior. she said it’s because i always cause problems (despite being divorced they both still talk, and she always supports him when we get into a fight because she wants to stay on his side to collect benefits, we’re going on a vacation soon and hes paying for all her expenses on the trip). i then told her that he needs to talk to him and get it together, how could you think that after what he said and what he did that he’s the one who’s the victim. she then told me that if i ever were to tell anyone or report it to anybody that he would kill himself and that there id be left with nothing. she said that the officers would take me to a children’s home and live a horrible life. she continued on with this a little more, saying that i’m the reason this happens, that it’s my behavior, that im the root of all problems, and that id be the reason they kill themselves. an extra detail i want to put in: i live with my dad and my grandma, but i didn’t think to go to my grandma about this (she was in the other room when this happened, because i knew she would back him up even further. whenever we get into fights she always supports my father, despite whatever he does, even when he does some truly messed up things. when she comes to bring me dinner later, she doesn’t say anything, she pretends nothing happened; i believe this is because she knows that this time he did mess up, that he was the one in the wrong, i’m scared of what she might to support him though. thinking about his death threat has made me thought that she would be capable of that as well, as long as to support her son from anything ever happening to him. another add on: i sleep in the same room as my grandmother due to us moving homes right now, so i don’t have my own room where i can lock myself away from them. please help, i don’t feel safe, and i don’t know what to do. i don’t feel safe sleeping this night, i have a feeling that something horrible going to happy this night. i feel as though they might do something while im asleep, please help. i left my last message to my mom with confidence, “i’m not dumb like other kids, i know my rights and im not afraid to use them” i will admit i got a little cocky but now im really scared. i know that if i call for help, like the cops or the domestic help line, that ill lose everything: my home, my future (i wouldn’t be able to live a life as good as the one i am now), my items, my extracurricular classes (music, acting, dance, etc) , my school (private), and my career (im an actor and a musician, my career was just starting to take off with a film i would be in, i’d lose everything). please help, i don’t know what to do, im really scared to keep living here, and i don’t have anyone who i can go to, even outside family would support my parents instead of me. i know that i need to get help, but i don’t want to lose everything. please help."
"tw: abuse 

long story short, my dad was abusive and lost custody of me when i was 13. haven’t talked to him since for the most part. 

he died in august. apparently there was only a copy of the will that wasn’t legally binding stating Karl (dads only friend) and Sam (uncle who cut me and whole family off) were executors. 

Karl doesn’t want anything to do w it because his mom just died and he’s dealing with it. Sam says ok i’ll do it. week later Sam calls me and says to get an attorney bc he’s not doing it. attorney tells me as long as i don’t touch anything im not responsible. 

months go by. Karl calls me and says my dad had lots of valuable paintings and baseball cards and a bank account w 10-80k in it. can’t provide proof. is the only one that’s been in the apt. wants me to sign papers claiming myself as the heir and naming him my attorney. 

in exchange for cleaning out the apt, storage unit, paying dads bills, etc, Karl will get half the paintings, all the cards and i’ll get the bank account. 

scenario 1: i sign, Karl takes all the valueables and leaves me all the bills and cleaning to do, im fucked 

scenario 2: i sign, karl is trustworthy but there are no valuables at all, and we’re both screwed 

scenario 3: i sign, there’s a ton, we’re both rich 

scenario 4: i pay an attorney to find out how much is in the bank. if there’s a lot, i take it and the responsibility. if there’s not, i say eff it. Karl is left out of it. 

scenario 5: i leave all of it now and never know 

things to consider: my dad used to be so poor he’d make me steal food. he lived his life in low income housing and spent money on trips to florida and beer and pizza. he was never into art. but he sold a lot of property and was always talking about moving to vegas and idk what he did for the last 10 years. 

tldr; 

if you had the opportunity to find out if you were an heiress but it meant you could be responsible for your dead abusive dads bills, would you do it? we’re talking like risk of -10k and reward up to +50k.  "
"We were bickering about something that occurred with my grandmothers phone, and she began to raise her voice, so I did the same in defense, she then proceeded to tell me to stfu and ""yell at me again and ill kick you in the f\*\*\*ing head"", then began to tell me how she would take me out to the backyard and beat me black and blue with a pipe if I didn't continue my school work (I am homeschooling so that is near impossible) and went on to tell me that any officer or cloister would take her side because ""violence is the only option and it works"" and then continued to tell me how she would kick and punch me in the head, and beat me with the pipe, and my grandmother who I live with would have no right to stop her or say anything because it would be hypocritical to stop her and not stop my uncle who used to lay his hands on his kids"
"It’s just really obvious.  She is jealous, I guess that I’m younger than her ??  And wants to make me jealous all the time.  Showed excitement a year ago when I was potentially terminally ill.  A year before that I almost died and she convinced me not to go to the hospital, which I did eventually, and it ended up saving my life.  Like she doesn’t just hate me she wants me to die."
"My girlfriend (17 FM) lives at home with her single father, and he has manic depression. I've been dating her for 4 months, and throughout this time I've helped her get through very stressful scenarios that have also taken a toll on my mental health. First, her father became suicidal after breaking up with his girlfriend, and my girlfriend had to help him through that. Then, her dad had a manic episode which led to him smashing everything in her room and pushing her to the floor, and kicking her out. I begged her to let me call the police, but she cares about her father so much that she begged me not to. They got over that and she moved back, and it's been good... Until he started talking to a new girl.  Tonight he had another manic epsiode because her dog knocked over and broke a small vase. Yes, a vase. Then his girlfriend over the phone was saying that he shouldn't let her dog on anything anymore because of it. He punished the dog by throwing him into a cage, and smashing on the wall of the cage to scare him. My girlfriend got mad because of how he was treating it over a literal accident, and then he lost his absolute marbles. Said that she has to keep her door open from now on even if she's getting changed, and it's her fault if he sees her naked. He said that she isn't allowed to go anywhere besides work or school until she graduates highschool, so I won't see her for 2 months. He also said that she needs to now pay 150$ a week to live there. Oh and also he kicked her off of the wifi so she can't contac4 me without data. It's really stressful, and I don't know how I can assist her through this. I know it's alot of a burden for me to take on, but I care about her and I hate seeing human beings go through such inhuman treatment. I feel like this isn't reasonable treatment, and I actually think it's abuse. Can I please get some advice 😭 I don't know what to do"
"When my Mum and dad got divorced I went to live with my dad for 2 years and then came to live with my mum and stepdad. We would regularly get into fights but not physical until they started getting physical and then we did not fight for 6 months so I thought it was all good until *stepdad me and mum*. One time our dog almost died for going through the bin and they blamed me of course. And about a month later or the day I’m writing this it happened again. Stepdad kept shouting at me that our dog almost died last time and I told him to shut the the fuck up and then he came at me and kicked me,This time I had some sense in me and I fought back. My mum didn’t even stop us. I have a bruise on my stomach and I’m currently in the bathroom and locked myself up in here cause I can’t deal with these shitty people anymore. My mum tried her best to be a good parent but she’s not fit for it. I wish I never existed. I’m glad my dad is supporting me in Australia through this. "
"Right now everything feels wrong and like it will never be right again. My mom keep trying to make me open up to them when I tell them that I'm not comfortable with it and would rather just keep it to myself. 

One time when we were at Costco, my mom asked me why I looked so sad and I half-heartedly told her I was just thinking about my friend (who, at the time, had been ghosting me and was making me anxious) but that it was nothing to worry about. She proceeded to belittle and guilt trip me *in the middle of the store* in an effort to make me talk to her when I clearly stated to her *multiple times* that I didn't want to before giving up and making me feel bad by shooting me dirty looks and being very curt. Eventually, I couldn't take the treatment anymore and finally told her about my friend ghosting me through tears before she brushed it off with ""He's probably just tired today, give him some space"". I just nodded and said okay, thinking that this was just a normal thing that parents said when their kid talked to them. I later learned that it wasn't.

Another time I was with another of my friends and my mom had called me. I was laughing and having a good time and answered to her screaming at me over how I left our dog outside for 2 hours (nobody else was home and I was leaving to be picked up by my friend). I apologized immediately and said that I had genuinely no idea how he'd gotten out and didn't know he was outside in the first place, as well as that I'd never leave my dog outside *on purpose*. She called my reasoning bullshit and drove me to tears *infront* of my friend and her mom. She does this a lot, so I just wiped away my tears and told my friend that I was okay and that it was normal. My friend's mom said, ""That's not normal. Parents don't scream at their child over the phone until they cry.""

What is hurting me? What *isn't* hurting me? What the actual *fuck* is going on???"

"Urgent ‼️ 
I 16F need to move out asap. My mother has always been both physically and emotionally abusive however, this last weekend was the end of any sort of peace. Long story short my mom came home tired and irritable Friday night and took it out on my family like usual. She got physically violent with multiple family members and I ended up calling the cops. She now has her third domestic violence charge and is being investigated for child endangerment. She is extremely mad at me and blamed me for this weekends events. She was jailed Friday night to Saturday morning when my older sister picked her up. She has since been away on a trip originally planned weeks prior but she gets back tonight. She has mad non stop threats over text in paragraphs blaming me, telling me she will take away everything and not provide even the bare minimum anymore. Now I can not be here anymore, it is no longer safe for not only my mental well being bust possibly even physical. i  only have one place to go. my grandma(moms mom) is the only long term option i have that is realistic to my schooling and work. she lives just 10 minutes from both my school and work and has a bus stop across the street from her neighborhood. We are on generally good TERMS and a neutral relationship but i haven't had much contact with her the past year and a half since my mom cut her off. i am thinking of offering to pay for groceries and gas when needed(which will be rarely thanks to the bus), do chores when needed, and i'm supposed to get a license soon and more than likely a car within the next month thanks to my grandpa(my dads dad). but i am still concerned on how im going to convince her to take me in for at least a year. I also don’t know how i will get my info from my mom without her freaking out because she will not be happy losing control over me. Any advice would help."
"Im turning 14 on the first of June this year and my parents are emotionally abusive. Let me just say some of the things that have happened, My mom often tells me that Im going to get her into a mental hospital, calls me stupid,laughs and tells me to shut up when I try to talk to her about how I feel.My dad was physically abusive and I was hit, kicked, and almost strangled but I luckily pushed him away in time. A few months ago my parents got into an enormous argument which caused them to live separately. My mom kicked me out of her house( for throwing something in the wrong bin btw) so I had to go live by my father. (PS:At this time I hadn’t been in school for a few months because I was told I was going to leave the country.) Almost every night he went to the bar and left me at home alone. One night I had to wait 6 hours for him to get back, the power went out and he took my phone with him because he claimed that I miss behaved, so I sat there in the dark for hours just sitting. When he got back, his whole head was open because apparently on his way back from the bar someone threw him with a brick and stole his phone, apple watch and credit card. He was shouting and screaming at me and even smashed plates broken. Our neighbours heard him screaming and luckily, one was a cop. So he called the police on my dad and punched him a few times, when I started to sob my dad told me “look what you have done”. My dad was kicked out of the house we were staying in and had to go live with my mom. A Social worker came and told us that me and my sisters must go to different families because of my parents. So my parents, me and my sisters had to leave the country. Im half dutch so we decided to go to THE NETHERLANDS. Btw much worse than this happened, Im just too disgusted to say it here.

So does anyone know a way that I can get away from my parents in The Netherlands? I don’t know any of my family from the Netherlands so I can’t go to them. A place I can go that isn’t an orphanage?Just to get away from my abusive parents please let me know. :)"
"My dad has done so many things in my life that are not considered normal, for instance he cut off all my hair with a pair of kitchen scissors as I begged him not to, I pleaded and pleaded but he cut it by force. Since then every tiny little thing I do that lands me in a bit of trouble he uses it against me. And the instance in which he even cut off my hair to begin with all I did was tell my sisters tutor that Im having trouble with biology and school is difficult, he then proceeded to tell my father that im an unserious student, that combined with petty complains of my unclean room and leaving dishes upstairs made him beat me up with a belt till I was bleeding and forcefully cut off my hair (I'm a girl by the way so this was very demoralzing and I became slightly depressed and had zero self confidence)  
My mum is barely any help whatsoever, she sometimes switches up and joins his side by adding fuel to the fire and if not she leaves and goes upstairs with the rest of my siblings so they don't witness all of this. I once went upstairs and pleaded and cried with her to make my dad stop and she looked at me with a pitiful look on her face and said there's nothing she can do. There's many instances this has happened and I can broadly mention them, once I put on press on nails and I was told they were ""too long"" (they were not that long) and I was told to remove them but then I forgot and the following evening he beat me up and almost cut my hair but luckly I hid the scissors prior. This has been off and on and my dad is bipolar because later on he can start calling me his ""sweet girl"" and act all lovingly to me. Trust me this is not the start there's so much more I can say. I can't go to a trusted adult because this is deemed as ""normal"" I also tried talking to a few teachers about it and they've done nothing whatsoever, im only 15 please give me any advice."
"Iam 15 (male) and my sister is 22, we live in pakistan,  ever since the farthest can recall my life I have always been subjected to a life of blatant favoritism, neglect and abuse. Regarding favoritism my sister was always the epitome of success and perfection amongst my parents and relatives alike, everything she did even if it was wrong was just passed off as a minor mistake by a princess, she was an average grade student  throughout her school life, an A+ student in middle school and pretty average throughout highschool (9th to 10th) and 11th-12th. Her results were always celebrated and she always recived tons of gifts. Whenever our distant relatives would come over or we would go to their houses she would always be greeted with such excitement and whatnot, given gifts, cash etc Meanwhile I was told to shut up and sit in a corner. Rarely got minor gifts and some slim money. Her pocket money has been 14000 pkr/month since she was 6, which isn't alot in first world countries but very valuable here. Meanwhile I have only been getting 1000 pkr since 13 years old. She would always have her friends over and I would be told to go to the rooftop for the time being her friends was there. I wasn't even allowed on the second floor of our house and the rooftop in the cracking heat of the sun has only 1 tiny shed with tools, bricks, boxes and cobwebs and whatnot. During special occassions and festivals like Eid or Birthdays. Mine would never even be celebrated I wouldn't even be wished most of the time while her celebration would be for 2 days. (Her birthday and the day before it). With again gifts and cash and whatnot. Also I only got a mobile phone at 13 after working in manual labour in construction for 1 year for 3 hours after school and saving up the money i'd get at the end of the day. The only electronic my parents ever bought me was a cheap tiny iBall tablet at 7 years old which upon reciving they forcefully took it from me saying ""just let your sister play on it for some time"" which she broke after raging in a videogame I broke down crying that day and never forgot. Oh and she had an iPad at that time. A genuine iPad pro and a good spec Panasonic phone btw all paid for by my parents. As a 12 year old ofcourse I didn't want to do construction labour, i wanted to play, have friends and have fun like any other child my parents forced me into it saying ""You'll have to make money one way or the other, we already take care of your sister so you'll burden us even more, you are a boy so make it work"". This is just scratching the surface I might write more in the future there is so much more I want to write about their favoritisim but let's cover the other 2 topics aswell. 
Regarding neglect. 

Most of the times when I would be sick with excruciating fever and other flus for days, my father wouldn't even give me medicine saying ""suck it up, walk it off already drink some water"" and whenever i'd try to sleep to alleviate the pain he'd always wake me up and force me to walk. It's only after multiple days that he'd finally call a local travelling doctor for a checkup, he woould  also try to cheap out on medicine like it was a game mind you the checkup and medicine together costed less than a dollar and he was still hesitant to pay for it. One February when i was 9 years old i woke up with extreme pain in my abdomen area, it felt like constantly being stabbed and torched at the same time and it did not stop. I woke up crying i did not know what it was I would always vomit anything i consumed any liquid, food anything. After 3 days of excruciating non stop crying, not being able to sleep and harming myself only did he take me to a hospital where upon checkup i was diagnosed with Chronic pancreatitis, only then did I recieve treatment and finally healed for the love of god. These are just 2 instances there are way more like the times my parents would go on trips with my sister and leave me alone in the house often with no food at all. 

Regarding abuse- 

Oh boy where do I start this brought me so much trauma even writing about it will probably make me unable to sleep tonight. Firstly when I was 8, my sister forcefully took my turn to play a retro game on my parents computer. I could just watch her play so I did, she sucked at the game and would punch the keyboard a few times. I'd tell her to stop she'd break it. Eventually she lashed out and broke the keyboard keys flew everywhere and it was completely cooked. I rushed to my dad and told him what happened i told him what my sister did with as much fear and truth as an 8 year old could emmit, my father upon reaching there saw my sister get up from her chair casually just pick her phone up from the desk and say ""he's the one who did it"" and my father completely believed her like no suspicion at all. You know what he did next? Took out a broomstick and started thrashing me mercilessly i jumped back and started crying asking him why is he doing this multiple times shes the one who broke it. He slapped me across the whole face multiple times my mother didn't give a single fuck and was reading a book with headphones in. He tied a rope to my (a fucking 8 year old's) arm and took me outside, he took me to the tree in the field next door and tied me up there while slapping me multiple times, locals came and asked what he was doing he made multiple excuses and exaggerated things until someone he knew came and told him something regarding not to tie under this tree no one goes under this tree because of some paranormal bullshit so my father took my home and locked me in the storage room upstairs (2nd floor) and smashed the broken keyboard on my head and locked me in for the rest of the day. All i had was a pot of water and nothing else. I was only unlocked after the sunset and given no food whatsoever all i could do was sob and cry sitting in the darkness while I tried to assemble the broken keys back onto the keyboard. This is just one instance oh no there is so much more. one day idk what age, i dropped 100 pkr (way way way less than a single dollar) and my punishment? Well kicked from home for the day (not the first time at all) then i was dragged back and tied up infront of my home and given water in a pot like a fucking animal idk what happened after that during the day but it was not fucking plesant. Oh just to showcase the irony, my sister stole 160k pkr from my parents locker. (45 something percent her dad's monthly income, he's never been a dad to me) and casually defended herself like nothing happened at all my parents believed her like she was god. All eyes were on me and even though they had no evidence on me i was kicked out of the house after being beaten and went to live with my aunt for a few days. During my third day at my aunt's my sister stole another 90k pkr from my parents locker this time I wasn't there so how could it be me?. Here's how I know it was my sister's doing. After I returned home i suspected her to the core. That night at 9:00 she messeged me saying ""smoothie tonight, my treat"" i was suspicious i asked her what's the catch why being nice to me she just told me to relax and she'd bring it over to me after 30 mins I was way too sus, eventually after she brought it i dipped my pinky in it and tasted it... It tasted... Bitter like something had been mixed in it. I thought it might be berry stems she forgot to remove but I was sceptical. She always kept barging into my room multiple times asking if I drank it i replied ""wait I'm busy ill put the glass outside when I'm done"" i was sure that she was trying to poison me... But then I remembered about the money i immediately dumped the smoothie in a polythene bag and hid it behind my wardrobe and pretended to my sister that I drank it. I knew she put her sleeping pills into it and I was right after 4 hours (1am) she slowly came into my room slowly turned on the lights poked my head a few times i pretended to be dead fucking asleep dead asleep. But I wasn't due to the paranoia, I didn't make a single move not a single word and saw from underneath my blanket her opening my parents locker (it was in my room) with a duplicate key and look for any money they might have left there still. After 10 minutes she couldn't find anything because they moved it all to the bank she just left. Next day I told my parents they questioned me doubted me etc etc but the pussies didn't dare confront my sister. My sister was always spoiled and threw a tantrum on every minor in convience my parents always fed her delusions and was visibily scared by her. Well a week after that alot happened, they discovered her being in severe debt and having written down the amount she stole in her diaries the people she gotta pay back what more she gotta steal etc etc. my parents being the absolute pussies cuddled up to her (22 ears old btw this happened in 2024 fucking 2024) like a fucking toddler and she said she didn't steal anything and it was her money and she took a loan etc etc for an A.I course. My parents believed her without a doubt paid off her debt and went back like nothing happened. She conned them like her bitches she had no course she is a university dropout she doesn't study has 0 books and never did they see that she doesn't fucking study. The night after that they discovered she sent nudes to over 5 guys and has been sending for the past 2 years after lying to them she doesn't talk to any guys. My aunt caught her when she was at her house. They discovered that when she was in university all she did was skip classes go to bars, drink behind their backs take addictive substances and sleep with multiple guys. They discovered the pictures of her and her guy ""friends"" her in their car drinking smoking and pictures of her and a dudes in hotel rooms. She had absolutely no shame and 1 day after that my father just said let's forget anything even happened and just went back to normal without even confronting her. She's still doing these things but they won't listen to me I have lost all hopes in them and want to cut them off asap. 

90% of the things are unmentioned. (Academic unfairness, privacy breach etc etc). If you read this far thank you and i appreciate you.

"They are literally crazy. If anything happen of we do something wrong the first ""punishment"" that comes to their minds is that theirs no food for us I mean are they crazy??!!!?? What did you mean no food for us. They always twist our words and actions its tiring and annoying and my mother if anything happens she always victimize herself she hits ,shout , curse at us I am in this stress for yearssss. And i am not doing well at school my grades are dropping my concentration is gone. I am tired I just wanna sleep and never wake up again..."
So my mom is mostly like this because of her ex-boyfriend and her job position as a manager if I try to say I’m sick all she will do it hit me with a belt and scream until I wake up it’s so bad I’m numb to it I don’t know where this came from but I can’t do anything
"My parents abuse me and my siblings every day. We live in such stress and horrible home they are always shouting always screaming at us my mother is a narcissist and always victimize herself and my father only listens to her he never try to understand or listen to us he just shouts and scream at us I have seen my big sister getting hit ever since I remember my mom would grab her from her hair and slap her hit her in the stomach. My parents always hit me too and my brother. I'm the middle child and I have been hit so much. And they always telling me stuff like ""you're a failure you will never get anything done in your life"" it's awful and the problem that we get abused for stupid reasons like watching TV for too long for eating much. It's horrible and there's nothing I can do I'm 17 and I have depression truma anger issues thinking of suic*de I'm tired and I don't know what to do..."
"Why do people do this? It baffles me, it truly does. I was victim of an abusive mother, and I went no contact years ago and never speak her name. I will never post about her on social media, I have deleted all traces of her from my life. 

However, SIL will tell anyone and everyone how bad her mother was to her as a child, and was estranged from her most of her adult life. But here’s what I don’t get…. She truly was an evil woman who beat her kids, drank herself silly everyday, had affairs and went on holiday and left them to fend for themselves. 

MIL died in the last 2/3 years and all SIL does now is post constantly about her mother and how she’s missing her and painting this false image to the world that her mother was this person she wasn’t. She is always posting about the milestones her mum is missing; her engagement, her upcoming wedding..! And how things would be different if she was here. I’m thinking ‘that is a lie’. She didn’t even bother to go to your graduation! Why would she care if u were getting married. 

I am really baffled as to why people lie when someone dies. Like all the bad they did never happened and suddenly they are the best mother that ever existed. Yesterday she posted one of her usual posts with pics of her and her mum when she was a kid, the usual garbage seeking attention and late last night I posted something on my Instagram about my own healing journey and she replied ‘so true’ ‘for real’ etc, but today she will prob post another attention seeking post for sympathy. 

Can someone explain why people do this? 
This person ruined your childhood with abuse, they left scars that no time heals, they die and suddenly they are promoted to saint hood overnight and can do no wrong! But when you talk to me u will tell me all the evil things she did but on Facebook u tell a different story! I can’t bare this attention seeking! "
"as the title says, I believe I was told I am a burden to my family. or ""family"", because I do not consider them to be family  


As per usual, my narcissistic ""mother"" is acting like a child, having meltdowns about minor issues. Nothing out of the usual, but it is becoming unbearable.  
Its not uncommon for her to berate me or call me derogatory names, such as dumbass, idiot, ungrateful, selfish, nasty, pig, lazy, pathetic excuse of a human being, and useless.   
Today was no different. She was yapping on about how much of a useless human being I am, etc. Until she snapped at me and told me   
""Nan and I could have had so much done with our lives if you weren't always in the fucking way""    
In other words, I am a burden to them both. I make their lives miserable, and cause them nothing but trouble.   
And yet I have no choice but to sit here and take it. Because no one can or will help"
"As the title suggests my mom did apologize. For context she is a narcissistic, self-centered, egomaniacal jerk who has way too much pride. Way above the legal limit and around 2 years ago while I was doing high school I was struggling in Math, then again I had been failing Math for a long time and her way of helping or ""helping"" me was physical abuse. I would get so overwhelmed that I would just block every sense, I just did not want to deal with it. She decided to take a bunch of news papers and make it into a stick and repeatedly hit me with it for 8 months, things got to a point that I hated myself so much that I could not look at myself in the mirror because an additional gift I got with the physical abuse was a high level of emotional manipulation. I have always been a slow learner and would get overwhelmed easily and the physical abuse just made it worse. I eventually started pushing myself just so that I could avoid being hit or hurt by her, even if I was heavily burnt out I did not care I wanted the pain to stop. She was also emotionally volatile during that time due to family troubles especially with her parents. My grandfather is also a Narc and my grandmother is a gossip talker who will talk trash about everyone. My mom got all these negative traits from them, eventually the abuse stopped after my Math final and I got 80% for those wondering and my mom got the bragging rights telling about my hard-work and her excellent couching. I don't know if this is a trend in India but I hope it's not but every person is willing to go to great lengths to please and impress relatives who will not give a damn about them. One example was when my aunt came over and my mom was going on and on about my choice to become a doctor while behind the scenes she was forcing me to do it. She loves bragging and in the due process she is losing her children for people who do not care about her. Fast forward 2 years I took business and I am doing really well since I have a great deal of interest in the topic and I was allowed to take this subject because I began to fail my science classes.   


Additional information: My family owns a small business and we have a store which is a 15 minute drive from here and my mom takes care of it full time. Additionally I with my sibs take tutoring as per her request and thankfully we take the profits as well since we take the classes.  


One issue with my mom is she does not realize the work we do. Both science and business are not easy subjects so I take a lot of time with it and we are in open schooling so I have the ability to plan my day. I start at 8.30 AM then stop at 12.30 PM for lunch then I resume at 1.30 PM and finish up at 5.30PM then I play video games. So I spend a lot of time learning things up and it takes a lot of time especially in subjects like Statistics. She does not understand this and she makes spontaneous plans on the dot. She is a light sleeper and an empty mind is the devil's workshop and she makes an insane plan and announces it the very next day which get's into your nerves. If we are going to the shop I need to re-plan the whole day since I heavily reliant on A.I to form my subject material and I rely on it for questions to solve and I have to take 2 subject books, 1 regular book, My calculations notebook, My laptop, other electronics which is a tedious task. When I ask her for 15 minutes to plan she looses her cool and goes on and on. Once I had to stay up till 1.00 AM to solve a particular formula so I wanted to sleep in and she wakes me up at 7.00 AM and asks me to come with her to the store. She did not even allow me to brush my teeth or even have some milk. She would get so upset even if we agree to come but ask for some time to plan that she would leave on the spot and then blame us.  


Onto today so I wake up and do normal stuff I go through some of the topics I will be learning and plan a timetable and I go down for some milk and then she calls me to her room and apologizes and I quote ""Do you remember the day I lost my cool while teaching you and hit you? well I am sorry"". Ok step in the right direction but small problem, it was not one day it was 8 months and it did not stop there she is very very emotionally abusive. But hey at least she apologized and I gladly accepted but then she went on for 15 minutes on how I would always struggle and how I hurt her by driving her insane. That tipped me off the wrong way, like if you are taking accountability you don't blame the other party, you don't try to justify your wrong doing. That made me instantly realize that despite everything she still holds onto that damn ego. The abuse was 2 years ago and this festered in her for 2 whole years but to rub salt in the wound my sister later told me that she had to convince mom to apologize to me. Mom was reluctant to say sorry to me, To make matters even worse mom went on for an additional 15 minutes telling me about how I am not doing enough in studies. She has no idea how much I do and suddenly she is now an expert. so for 1 minute I had hope but for the next 30 minutes that hope along with any faith that I could possibly have relationship with her was just washed down the drain.   


Now she wants me to come to the store with her so she can couch me the subjects. Problem with this is that she has no commitment, she will only help me for 2 days at max then I am back to doing it on my own and she has a problem with everything I do she does not like my format of notes and she is a major control freak and if I go there and learn from her again chances are I am doomed.   


I don't know how to deal with this. My siblings are my literal pillars at this moment and honestly I depend on them way too much for matters like this. Anyways wish me luck I just wanted to vent this out in a safe space.  


Thank you."
"Hi, I'm a 27-year-old woman. I've taken a career break for mental health reasons and it's been 6 months since I moved home. I moved here because my parents and I thought it'd be the perfect scenario for me to recover from my mental ailments, but surprise surprise, it happened to be the worst decision I ever made. In the whole span of 6 months, I broke down, hurt myself, and developed fresh new traumas because of my father's temper. It has been happening since I was a little kid with no understanding of wrongs and right, and with time it has only worsened with only one good change: he doesn't beat the shit out of me anymore. With age and outside exposure, I learned that whatever my father said and did to me all this time was horribly wrong. But somehow I always managed to forgive him and keep a soft spot for him. I always had a hope that if I tried to explain it to him calmly he might see his wrongdoing and he would change. But who was I kidding, he has become worse let alone changed even a bit. Today was the last straw of my scrapes of patience. He lost it unreasonably as usual plus he hit my mother. This time I wasn't quiet, I yelled back calling out on his bullshit. Next, he threatened to kill himself with a knife. This wasn't new btw. Every time he felt that he had no more cards, he threatened to die. Me, my sister, and my mother have spent our whole life not back-talking because this man had us shit scared of committing suicide. Anyway, I digressed. So today after his ""suicide"" drama, my mom and sister jumped on him to stop him. I was sitting and watching the show because I knew those were all empty threats to gain sympathy. He got so damn furious seeing me unaffected and that's when I added more to my words but this time in a calm tone. He couldn't take that too and finally shouted at the top of his voice telling me to shut the fuck up, while still being physically aggressive towards my mom and sister. I got up, came to my room, cried my eyes out, and decided to leave for good. All my life even after being right in the middle of the same abuse repeatedly, I never thought of leaving. But now I'm done.  I have no money and no job or job prospects. My boyfriend is helping me with the money and my friend is gonna let me stay at her place for a while. The plan is to get out of here find a job and never look back. But who am I kidding, when has life worked out as per the plan?

Although this step looks like my only option to end this bullshit once and for all, I'm still unsure. I need some help and suggestions from you guys on whether I should go ahead with my plan or not. Are there any other options that I can explore?"
"Hi, I'm 18 and I'm moving out this autumn but my brother is 13 and will be left behind. Obviously I can't take him with me right now so he will stay with our parents who are not that nice, scream around a lot and mentally drain both of us. I just feel so guilty for leaving but I really can't take it anymore. I do want him to br okay and I'm scared that he will suffer more because they'll be angry that I moved out. I just want my brother to be okay, this is the first time since always that we're on such good terms."
"Some of the stories I've read here are dreadful and my heart goes out to you guys. My story started when my parents decided to move to a foreign country when I was 6. Both my parents were narcissists and their relationship was already shacky even before then. My mother suffers from untreated depression and outright had a temper tantrum on the week of our departure and my father likely suffered from CPTSD from his screwed-up childhood and was completely mechanic and unable to feel empathy. My mother had an abusive father and my father was abandoned by his when he was 5. So a lot of undealt trauma going on all around.  


My father wasn't present from the time of our move and my mother worked at night so I started to take care of myself when I was 6 and by the time my parents divorced, I became the head of the house until my mother remarried. My mother was deep in depression, which I understand. Divorce was terrible for my as a child but it must be equally terrible for them. I know they both dealt badly with it. My father became an alcoholic and I was forced to spend every weekend with him, removing any possibility for me to have a social life as a normal teenager.   
My father died some time ago due to cancer, without ever trying to fix our relationship so that's a done deal but my mother's relationship keeps getting difficult. I'm neurodivergent (ADHD, HSP) and I suffer from CPTSD, PTSD, and Social Anxiety and have suffered burnout among other health issues and lost everything. My home, job, studies, girlfriend, all my possessions aside from a backpack with two changes of clothes and my old laptop. I eventually moved out back to my home country as a defacto homeless person.   


Distance has been good for me. But my mother keeps on not respecting my boundaries and I don't even think she's aware of her behaviour and she's hostile to any conversation regarding her doing anything wrong. I sometimes don't feel like talking or answering the phone and if I did that back when I lived close to my mother's (70km), if I did, I would have my stepfather at my house within the hour, disregarding any of my privacy or right to be left alone. My health problems are not live threatening and I was never suicidal so there was no reason for such reaction. I felt mad and felt bad for my poor stepfather who is a great bloke. No I live 2000km away, she can't do that but will still become abusive by phone call and will go as far as calling the building concierge to check on me when I don't answer the phone. Mind you, I'm 45 yo and bloody well know how to live my life. I'm not perfect, far from it but this is ridiculous and aggravates me as well as doesn't help my mental state.   


She will pick on everything and I know mothers pick on things. ""Your beard is too big"" or ""You should cut your hair"" but when most mothers say that they don't get mad when you carefully and diplomatically say something to the form of  ""Thanks, but it's my choice!"" My mother has thrown temper tantrums when I refused to accept her decoration suggestions at my home. And the sort.   


And everything, she throws this line ""I don't want to make you feel guilty but we have paid so much for you, we deserve respect!"" and as for respect, she means I must be a yes man. I was there for 29 years while I lived under her roof and it was torture. And for paying, she means they helped me, and I'm thankful when I had my burnout and lost my job but then she goes and exaggerates, willingly or not and starts saying they paid for stuff they haven't, like my studies, my previous car and the such.   


I'm getting to the point where I'm just tired and want to be left alone. I'm single and lonely, yes. I have a few friends and have accepted I'm likely to never become a father but seeing what my predecessors did, that's probably not a bad thing. I would have loved to have a family but I don't want to be another abusive prick of a father. I come from a long line of those and maybe it's good it ends with me. I rather be lonely than be abused. I've cut ties to my father's family aside from my half-sister and I'm honestly thinking of cutting ties with my mother but I'm not sure she will let me. Or even if it is the right thing to do. I'm just really, really tired!  I'm sorry for dumping all this shit on you but I really needed to talk... and well... I don't have friends that I'm comfortable enough to bother them with this kind of thing. "
"All throughout yesterday, mom yelled at me and my brother in the car about our grades. We were supposed to go somewhere, but she was too mad to go to the place we were supposed to go, so she drove for hours. Keep in mind, we're high schoolers close to graduating, so we should've sorted this out by now. Grades have been a problem since elementary school, so you'd understand why she would yell for hours. 

She wishes we never existed, she says we're just like our dad (a liar, lazy, asshole, etc.), she tells us if we're so depressed, leave the house, she tells us we'll be whipped if we don't improve, she keeps asking ""What am I supposed to be proud of?"", we passed by a graveyard and she said ""You might as well be dead."", she threatens to drive the car off the edge, she keeps telling us ""Go find your dad."", she says everyone in the neighborhood thinks her scolding us is entertaining and the reason voices are heard outside is because they're talking about us, she says we're making her ""look like the bitch"", she threatens to hit us in public... 

She keeps reminding us of the day we reported her to CPS and says she's not abusing us. Well, she's right. It sounds abusive, but she spoils and doesn't neglect us. There were points where I considered therapy because I actually want to be happy, but my brother says that they're gonna ask me who's causing my sadness and mom will face criminal charges. No matter what anyone says or how mean she is, she is not an abuser. Abusers only abuse for no reason. Abusers treat their child like nothing. Mom is ""abusing"" because of our bad habits. Mom feeds us and provides shelter. 

She got straight A's and is working as a nurse. We should've put in the same work as her, but no. We're the first in our family to fail, we're the embodiment of our awful city and her amazing city actually tries in school. I keeo going ro credit recovery and it upsets her because school is about doing it right the first time. Failure is not okay. We have to be perfect or else. My grades are terrible every year, so I'm factually stupid. 

If anything, I'm the abuser. I'm the one who should be facing criminal charges for not getting good grades and overall doing my part. One day, I want to turn myself in to the police and directly ask them to arrest me. Doesn't matter if I broke a law or not, I have to be arrested or I'll become a worse person. 

I wish I was as smart as you, the person reading this. I wish I was as responsible, hardworking, and kind as you. I wish I was as perfect of a human being as you. You aren't a waste of human life, I am. You aren't a failure, I am. Whatever negative thought you're thinking about, apply them to me instead of yourself. I'm asking you to insult me instead of support me. I am not a victim. I am the abuser."
"My narcissistic mother makes me feel guilty about a fairly new connection, a fairly new friend, and the fact that I haven't met up with her since February. The first meeting was at the end of February. After that I went silent for the entire month of March, because this is a fairly new connection, as I said before. I met this peer at work. And it clicked. Then we met once, and then we didn't meet again for a month.  
  
But I did want to meet up with her again in April. I was just busy in March. I still wanted to visit Grandma and other family members and see their new cat. And meet up with my sister a few times. So I didn't think about it anymore. And my mother makes me feel so guilty about this. And pretends that it's too late to build a friendship now, and that I've already ruined everything. I said I would send her a message, next week. But my mother calls me ''lazy'' and ''inflexible''.  
  
Normally she makes me feel guilty about not visiting family members and Grandma. And now I do that, and it's still not good. This is quite a new connection/friendship, and is it weird to want to take things slow? Mother now acts as if I have neglected a full-fledged friendship. While she only sees friends once per an entire years or two years. It's not a full-fledged friendship, yet."

My longtime boyfriend(21) and I(19) ended up getting pregnant it wasn’t planned and I know it’s not ideal… but I have always wanted kids and I don’t want to abort my baby.

I’m still living at home with Nmom and step dad, while my bf and I save up for a place of our own, he has a full time job and is taking classes. I’m in college on a full ride and I have talked to my school about how to continue to stay in school with a baby and they are willing to work with me. 

The problems started when I told my mom I was pregnant, before I was even through telling her she immediately said she’d pay for an abortion I told her I didn’t want that and she laughed in my face, told me I had no idea what I was doing and that if I wanted this baby I had to move out immediately and she’d take me off her insurance and cut me out of the money left by my late father that is supposed to be split between the two of us. My step father tried to step in but she immediately shut him down. She said later when I “realized my huge mistake in having kids” she’d help me give my child up for adoption. She went on about how she did everything herself and made it but it’s not possible for me because I am too stupid and young(my was 20 when she had me) and she has no interest in being a grandmother at any point in her life and that’s when she finally admitted she just doesn’t like kids, I was shocked but not surprised. I knew she never liked me but I always assumed it was because of my dad or something about me.

My mom has always hated my boyfriend but idk I thought maybe once she heard I was having a baby things might change? Stupid I realize. 

She’s still pushing for me to have an abortion even after throwing me out and after I have repeatedly said I do not want one. I finally blocked her, I’m staying at my boyfriends place and we’re going to move in together it’s a small place but I think we can make it work. My step dad is working to sneak my things over, social security card, birth certificate etc things mom refuses to let me get. My bio dads parents are working to help me the best they can. They raised me more than my mom did. I’d stay with them for weeks while dad was overseas 

Should I go no contact? I know she has no interest in my baby and clearly doesn’t care about me, but at the same time she’s my mom and idk how to move on from that. How do I eventually explain to my kid why my mom isn’t part of their life?

"I need someone to tell me whether or not I should decide fo be homeless. My household is abusive in a myriad of ways. Starting when I was young, my parents would threaten to kick me out and disown me. My mother has disparaged me by calling me names. Most notedly a bitch. Two days ago, I lost my glasses in my room and was looking for them when it was time to go to school. I was looking around the house and in my room, and she was waiting impatiently in the car. I wasn’t able to find them and she started censuring me. Saying that it was become my room was disorganized and saying “ Ain’t nobody’s fault but yours something something”. I did not want to be around her any longer, but luckily I was able to go to school. Later on that day, I came home and practiced my instrument until ten p.m, and then I went to take a shower. I was told I couldn’t because I waited too long and that it was late. Mind you, she came home at around 9 p.m and it was late but she could take a shower. I went to my room and looked up if I could use handsoap. She came to my room and said what are you doing, and I lied and said I wqs going to call my dad. (Which isn’t really a lie because I know I was going to end up calling my father.) She called me a rude ass and said that if I did she’d knock me the fuck out.  The previous day, we had gone to Publix to order a sandwich for school. While in there, I accidentally didn’t say sir when I spoke to the male cashier and she made sure to loudly remind me to say it. In my entire life, I have done that aplenty of times, she felt that this time I needed to be reminded. Afterwards, in the car, she kept asking me why I was upset, and I ended up telling her that out of all the times I do say it, you want to focus on the one time I don’t. That incited her to go on a rant on how children are so rude these days and something something. No doubt something her older friend spewed to her. I haven’t spoken to her, and my father is acting like I should be thankful that she’s feeding me.  Another issue, I can’t eat anything or use anything without her getting angry with me. If I want chicken, I have to wait for her to fix it because apparently I take too much. My parents also exaggerate how much I eat. They’ll say that I’ll take two pieces of chicken or whatever of this. They’ll also say that I’m selfish because my siblings might want some and I eat all of what’s prepared within the week. I do eat it all, but my siblings never want any.  Now for the physical abuse, my mother has strangled me, slapped me, and has beaten me to the ground. This is a dilemma I have contemplated many times in my life. I think it’d be better, but I wouldn’t have any money, food, or water. I also wouldn’t be able to be in my marching or concert band anymore, and it would be hard trying to go to school because my parents would no doubt look for me. "
"can someone tell me if im just over reacting? 

today me, my brother, and my parents went out to eat nothing rlly happend until we got dairy queen we all got blizzards but my brother got a peanut butter blizzard every time i eat peanut/peanut butter it makes me feel like really sick and have small allergic reactions.

 and so my brother mixed up out blizzards and gave me the peanut butter one on accident so i took a bite and immediately spit it out because i tasted peanut butter. but i accidently spat it out one the ice cream and my mother started screaming at me like calling me names and cursing. she was calling me names like bitch, asshole , r-word and more. i scooped out the part a spat out can gave it back to my brother. and then my brother started to talk back a little to our mom and then it just started to escalate .

 as we were coming home everyone in the car was fighting but me. and then when we came home my mother and brother just were still fighting and then my parents said that they wanted to like kill us or like hurt us. 

me and my brothers parent have hit us a lot before when we were younger we used to get hit with metal spatulas and get dragged into our rooms and they have kicked me too the ground and stomped on me not on my brother though hes a rlly big guy and our parents tell us stuff like they wish we were never born or they wish we would die or runaway.  they always tell us that they want to send us away. this has been happening since i was 6.

so at home my brother mom and dad were rlly auguring at this point and my mom told my brother to give her his phone and my brother was like no hes a teenager so ofc he wouldnt give her his phone and she started getting rlly mad and my brother too. and my brother ran upstairs and accidently punched a hole in the wall. my parents basically sprinted upstairs and started screaming at him. like they said that they hated my brother and that they never loved him and they also said that they were going to hurt him i was in my room hearing this all happen and i wanted to help my brother but i was just so scared of what my parents were gonna do to us. and my dad said that he wanted to fight my brother and that he wanted to like REALLY hurt him but he said it would be too brutal and he didnt want to go to jail. and my parent always have a short temper and stuff like that but they rlly hurt us when there mad like one time they pinned me to the floor and started kicking and punching me until i was screaming so loud the neighbors could hear it. but idk if im just over reacting but i rlly dont want to go home after school anymore bc im scared of what they might do and they always tell me that if i ever call someone irl and tell them abt this that im going to get sent off and ill never see my brother and them agian. i really love my family but my parents rlly hurt me mentally and physically.

"My mom(43) has abused me in the past ever since I(16) was four. I thought it was normal growing up untill a few months ago when she humiliated me infront of guests, laughing while telling them about how she threw my tablet across the room, breaking it as it hit the wall because I was ""that addicted"".

What actually happened was my sister(11 at the time) made us some instant noodles. My older brother(9) and my sister wanted to watch Frozen while I wanted to watch the kung fu panda. Me being outnumbered decided that I would watch the movie on my tablet and my siblings were happy with that so I went to my room and watched kung fu panda on my tablet. Fast forward 10 minutes and my mom comes into my room ,screaming at me for being anti-social and took my tablet and smashed it against my back while yelling at me for how stupid I was then threw it against a wall and was leaving when my dad(who was sleeping in another room) woke up and heard what happened. He then asked what happened and why she did, my dad obviously told her how wrong she was while she refused to accept fault, he then comforted me as said he would fix my tablet as soon as he could and that he would be there for me. Something similar has happened every 2-3 months where my mom would beat me up for being a kid. But she would always do it after my dad had gone for work.
Just looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation"
"I know my father is awful and I’m ok estranging from him, but my mother (who doesn’t live with him) I’m a bit confused about. My mother is definitely abusive, around 4-5 years ago I told her I was suicidal and she was “supportive” of it, and she showed it to me by buying a whiteboard, putting it right in front of my bed and writing “it’s okay to kill yourself, I support you”, or like “ill love you in heaven or earth”, etc. etc. 6 years ago when I was in middle school she used to hit me, which she denied multiple times in front of cps when I was 17 before calling me crazy and saying she was taking me in to get tested for personality disorders (I have a history with mental health issues but nothing further than depression, I’ve always been quiet and isolating, angry only with parents after being hit or touched). She also accused me of emotionally abusing her when I was 12 after I told her that calling me names all the time made me feel bad and was abusive. Then when she accused me of abusing her, and me asking how, she would respond “well I don’t know but I’m only mean to you because I feel like your being mean to me”. Getting closer to 18 but before my birthday she also used to tell me that she didn’t care if I was ||murdered, raped or kidnapped|| because I wasn’t going to be her liability anymore multiple times. But whenever anything bad happens with my father, and since I’ve turned 18 she’s started to call me frequently and ask me if I need money or help or anything, and has told me that no matter what I want, her  and her friend who’s known me since I was a child are my support group whether I want them or not, and that I always have to check in with them. She’s been helpful even when I don’t need her, or when something happens, and am terrified to call my father, but am required to call at least one of my parents (due to the rules of the high school I attend). I never do anything terrible, the only time I’ve been required to contact a parent was recently when I missed my transportation back to campus and had to get back the next day and needed her to say she was okay with it. She’s been so nice lately, but she was just screaming at me as I was crying in the floor about how mentally f’ed up I am just a year ago. Should I forgive and forget, which I’ve done multiple times before, or is she just different because she knows I plan on not talking to her? Basically, am I justified in estranging?

  
edit: she also used to make fun of my eating disorder, laughing at me loudly in public spaces

but recently shes always telling me about how I should take advantage of life and that she doesn’t want me regretting anything and telling me that I should participate in fun activities like prom.

it just seems like she cares, I feel like I’m holding her to things that are all a year old at this point"
"Hi. I just want to get opinions on what exactly me and my dad should do. I don’t wanna go on all day about my whole childhood till now with this woman but moral of it all she’s mentally abusive and physically abusive. She also has bpd and refuses to get help. 
We have gotten the police involved so many times because of the way she is and nothing has came out of it. 
what you need to know is I no longer live with my dad. The only reason being is because even though he pays my rent and bills my mom kicked HIM out. They’ve been divorced for 7 years now and every single day from then she has been constantly calling him. He has her blocked and she still manages to yell at him through voice memo. She called his new girlfriend a bitch so many times. Despite the fact that they have been divorced for seven years, She has a job but told me not to tell him because she doesn’t want to pay rent but instead buy her own things like clothes, kitchen appliances and more. She bought cameras to spy on my dad’s family because they live on the third floor. She steals checks from him. She keeps all the lights on so he has to pay more bills. She’s even trying to tell him if she sees my dad hanging out with her brothers (he has a good relationship with her family) she will tell everyone he’s trying to rape and groom my 18 year old cousin). Which is the most disgusting thing ever. He has told my grandma about it and not my cousin though because we both know my cousin will LITERALLY try to fight my mom because sometimes she can be a little ghetto. My mom knows this is not true and is only saying this because she wants him to lose everything . I have been begging my dad to get her out of our apartment so he can move back in. How exactly should we get her removed? Because he’s trying to get in contact with the landlord and tell them about my mom and how he no longer will pay the rent and bills at my house unless they talk to my mom and see what she has to say. ( forgot to mention we live in NEW YORK. my dad already has to deal with my rent and his rent at his apartment in nj) Which then she will have no excuse because first of all her job is part-time. 
And I don’t think she needs enough money to pay rent and bills here . So that’s how we’re trying to get her out. 

My thing about court is what exactly should we do ? What if the court doesn’t listen to me because I’m still a minor ? I’m 15 and unsure if they will 100% hear me out . Will the court allow my dad to get his apartment back ? Or is it only the landlords choice? I’m also scared if she does get kicked out she will harass us . So What orders should I specifically get against my mom? Since she has a whole abusive history with me.
Do you think the court will believe my mom’s fake stories ? 
(Also another thing my dad has all the voice mails saved so I would like to know how it would help in court)and will they do something about the stolen money? I need answers so if you had the time to read thank you so much and let me know your thoughts and what orders I should try to get against my mom and a deep dive on how those orders are going to help! "
"18m. My mom is controlling to an insane degree. She doesnt let me talk to people, I havent had human contact in 4 months, everytime i try to get a job she has a mental breakdown- i have nobody to turn to. My boyfriend's family hates me and thinks im lying about my abuse so he's not allowed to talk to me either. I cant drive , i was homeschooled and I dont have my GED.

  
We both have been planning to run away together for months. It hasn't happened because he's struggling to find a job and I just dont know what to do. Ive been trying to find freelance work online to just scrape by a couple extra bucks but its not working out.

  
I have been extraordinarily depressed and im at the end of my rope

  
I need help figuring out how to get out desperately. Seeing that normal people are struggling to get homes doesnt help either. i dont want to feel like this anymore.  
USA. Any advice is loved."
"Text convo all from my mother: 

“You did it! Goodbye!
Nothing will be yours
Everything is going to Tanya
You can put me in Jail like you did with Bill
That is your fucking rotten nature!
Go to hell!!!
Die!
I hate you! You are a monster!
I told Maria never transfer you any money no more!
Go kill youself!!!”


Background info:

My lease was ending and my mother offered me to stay at her house. 

I started moving my stuff.  And I spent there about a week. 

When I was a child (3) she abandoned me and left my grandparents to take care of me.  I’m from a different country and she moved to the US. When I was 11 she brought me here. 

The “jail part about bill”. He was a pedo. He raped me when I was 12. My mother was too drunk to care when I confessed to her. So I kept living with them until he went to jail when I was 17. FBI was watching him for a few years and found underage stuff on his computer. 

Main point of the story:  

Yesterday my mother drank 3L of wine and she took my pills away (anxiety, sleeping pills). I went into her room and politely asked them to give them back. She refuses.  
She thought I was crazy (I am not) so she called the police and put her phone on a speaker. While she was on the phone with the police, she started choking me, then pushed me on the floor so hard I went unconscious for a bit.  

I didn’t call the police, she did. All because I shouldn’t be taking any pills. 

Police came, saw pressure marks on my body and blood in my hair. They immediately called an ambulance. They took me to the emergency room and did and mri (I think that’s what it called). Found a brain bleed. And I’m at risk of having a stroke now. 
I have almost nothing at my apartment, since I was moving to her place.  
My lease is ending and I don’t know where I’m going to live.

"Me ( 14M ) had come back home from a family event. My family and I were extremely tired so we showered and everyone headed to bed. When I woke up the next morning everyone was already done with their breakfast and there was no proper thing cooked just eggs and the usual. So I ordered two chicken sandwiches as they left the house for chores, I quietly ate and shoved the packaging behind my cupboard. This happened in the morning,just right now my dad had called me and repeated the whole order Infront of me as my younger brother had found everything and given the receipt to him. I was furious but confused. Then my parents started fully balling me with insults and started screaming at me saying "" when there was a maid , food so why did you order without permission? You just had to heat it up !!"" Even though I ordered cuz I felt like it , I didn't obviously say it and covered up by saying ""I wasn't given any food"". The mess continued and ended 10 mins after. Just two minutes ago my dad came into my room saying "" look if this is retaliation from your side , just stop you did the wrong thing and now you're being a total maniac about it busting your eyes out staring us in the eyes"". Just before he step foot in my room , my brother emptied out a whole stationery jar on my face cuz I didn't respond to him. A marker was even stuck in my glasses but my father said you threw it on your face when I entered. Now they've left and asked for all my money , wallet and phone. They say that "" if this is some friend's influence you can go live with that Psycho too .. "" I'm sure there mother can accommodate another retard and I would gladly throw you out"". "" "" You are nothing just a boy who's job is to only study "". eating all the time , sleeping all day and staying up all night."
"I tried posting about this on the anxiety subreddit because this is causing me really bad anxiety and since I also have diagnosed severe OCD it’s not letting me live normally anymore but everyone just laughed at me and I got no help so that led me to deleting my post. I hope that now I can actually get some help. so basically i smoke, no judgement pleasee I know it’s bad and I’m trying to stop. but basically what happened Is that more than four months ago I was out with a friend and we were waiting for the bus and while we were waiting for it i smoked a cig, after I was done i noticed that we were standing in front of my dad’s friends workplace, and he owns that place so he has access to all the cameras. 
The thing is, it’s not the smoking that I’m complaining about. It’s the fact that my dad is an abuser and that he has made it pretty clear to us that if he ever catches us doing something like this he will actually kill us (me and my siblings). I didn’t think much of it at first because my dad and this guy were on no contact for two years because of an argument they had, but he reached out to my dad. They talked but nothing about me still. This has gave me severe anxiety and panic attacks during the day and I’m just wondering what am I gonna do if he ever finds out? Was this coincidence? I mean whats with this timing? right now my mum is headed to my dad’s workplace because he told her he needed to show her something I am home and I am actually experiencing an anxiety I’ve never experienced. I don’t know what to do but I think if he find out I might just call the police or run away but I don’t think I’ll run away because I don’t want to put my mum in that position.

"So i know my parents are abusive butbrecently ive been thinking about when i was younger like 5-9, when i was 5 i started masturbating for somw reason (not by touching myself by like moving my legs a certain way it was weird) and my parents found out but they never discouraged it, if anything they would say it was ""good excersise"", so i would do this in front of family members, at school, everywhere because i thought it was excersise. One time i was in my dads office and he asked me to do smth similar to it, to ""work out my core"" he litterally watched me until i had an or6asm. I would also watch tv with my parents and be doing it and id say that it felt wrong and theyd say it was ""completely normal"" recently when i was 13 my dad thought i was fingering myself under the table (idk why) and he joked ""yeah just stick your finger up your vagina haha"" ""yeah go and do your stomach excersises"" and my mom shushed him and laughed. Also whenever hed yell at me when i was little id come to his bed the next morning to apologize for whatever i did and hed wrap his legs and arms around me until i litterally couldnt breath for like hours, id beg him to get off but he would just wrap tighter and tighter. one time he said he was gonna ""teach me how to spoon"" and my mom kept telling him to stop and he said ""shell have to learn eventually"" i was super uncomfortable, he also whipped out his dick one time and told me to look and i quickly looked away but him and my mom forced me to look and then i ran away"
"i grew up with a violent dad, he's been telling me i'm a monster since i was little and that i'm a brat.
he was constantly hitting me until i turned 16 and did it again when i was 17 1/2. i am now 20, he stopped being violent but he's still emotionally abusive.
i always bullied my little sister when we were kids, i stopped when i turned 14 i think? and i was super manipulative towards her. we're now bestfriends but she's still traumatized, i never yell at her anymore and we never fight. but she's deeply afraid to make me upset :( 

the thing with my dad is that he's very smart and charming, i hate him so much but i constantly seek his validation somehow. he's been degrading me all my life and then telling my he's proud of me. he always makes small disagreements into something much bigger and ends up telling me how i'm a stubborn ungrateful living monster. 

i spent my middle school years going to therapists, family therapists and social workers that my dad himself called for help. 
something that bugged me though was how they told me ""he's the once that called us knowing what could happen to him, so it must be a good thing right? the abuser seeking help for his victim""
they all called him out for being horrible to me and he managed to change and was actually nice to be around for 2 years. 

he became his old self again (except he doesn't the physical violence), he acts like a lunatic always gaslighting me and telling me how brainwashed i am, how the internet made me woke(??) we barely talk about politics but for example he thinks racism is bullshit where i live. i'm mixed and did experience lots of racism but he simply doesn't believe it. tells me to shut up when i try to join a conversation with him and my sister. 
i admit i often talk to him harshly when i don't agree with him on something. sometimes i wonder if he's a narcissist, every time i open my mouth he either scoffs or laughs. happened so much when i was a kid, if i wanted to try a new hobby he would just scoff in belief idk. i'm kind of rambling at this point sorry

he and my sister got very close over the past year and i'm not jealous or anything. i'm very close with my mom because i can speak her language whereas my sister struggles and has difficulties communicating with her. i'm just so so sad and worried my sister will stop liking me. he was violent with me but never with her. i was. 
i'm scared she'll find me insufferable for always arguing with him over nothing and everything. 

a couple of months ago we were all talking at diner and i don't remember how we got there but i told him 'he made me this way and i'm traumatized because of how he raised me'
which he responded that he had to raise me this way because i was already born defective and that no, what he put me though didn't impacted the way i am today.
i think about it everyday and i'm more and more convinced he's right. 
(i forgot to add i went to the psych ward 3 years ago because of my depression and suicidal thoughts.)
and when i mentioned my depression to my dad that day which was caused by him, he told me i never had depression and i was just going through a hard time. mind you i was diagnosed professionally. 

now i can't help but think i'm actually a horrible person that put my family through hell and still does.
but on the other hand i love my friends, i have lots of them, i try my best to treat them with so much care. they vaguely know what's going on at home i just tell them my dad is crazy. they all keep reminding me how great of a friend i am, that they feel loved by me. i can't help but think the Me at home is the real me and i'm probably putting on an act when i'm outside. why can't my dad love me? 

i don't know if i said enough, maybe it wasn't convincing enough so if anyone sees this and has questions on my dad i'll gladly answer them "
"Four years ago I escaped my abusive father. At the time I was 14 and I was very lucky. My father had always been very reactive. If my brother and I did some little mistake he would get angry and scream at us. He often hit us or locked us in our rooms, sometimes for multiple days. My mother is mentally ill ( she has did, depression and a split personality) because of that she had to go to a psychiatric hospital very often. During those times my brother and I were alone with my father. It was horrible. By the time I was six he started touching me and forcing me to touch him in places a child should never be close to. Later he started raping me. My brother would often get hit so hard that he had broken bones. I as the older sister was responsible for feeding my brother and making sure that he goes to school. My father was drunk or playing video games. When my mother was at home it was better but not great. My father stopped touching me but he would „hide“ sextoys in my room so I would find them. If my mother found them he would say I took them to have fun. My father threatened us by saying he would call the Jugendamt (German child protective services) and tell them to takes us away and he would then hurt our mum and kill all our animals. We were scared to tell anyone. 
When I was fourteen my brother, my mom and I went on a trip to visit moms friend. There I was finally able to open up about what happened, because he couldn’t get to us. My mom broke down in tears. She didn’t know all of it was happening. She took us to the police to report him. They didn’t really believe us and dropped the investigation. However my mom never took us back to him. We went to court and it took four years for them to give my mom sole custody for my brother( she didn’t get custody for me because by the time they decided I was already 18). If my mom would have not believed me I don’t think I would still be here. 

Now I have severe ptsd. I get scared around men and I have panic attacks. I don’t know what to do. I want to get help but the situation in Germany in regards to mental health is pretty bad so I can’t get a psychologist. What should I do?"
"I’m 21(M) and it’s been almost a year since I have spoken to my mother after a huge blowout we had that resulted in me spending the night in jail. Growing up I would say I had a decent life. We was far from rich but my mom did the best she could for me and my little brother and sister being a single mom and that I respect , but with that I can’t respect how she “disciplined” me and my sister thankfully my little bother rarely got in trouble  .I was far from a Golden child I got into fights in school, cussed out teachers so i understand being punished and receiving some whoopings with a belt but Is getting chocked, Be thrown around, head being pushed into walls considered a normal punishment? Times she would sit her full weight on my chest and pin me to the grown or on my back while pushing my fave into the floor. My mom was Large but she is not small either imagine a grown 160+ pound woman sitting full weight in a 8yrs olds chest or thrown him around like a ragdoll. One time my little sister got in trouble for something she did In school my mom was so mad while she was driving she literally reached back grabbed my sister by the hair and yanked  her up to the middle counsel, the proceeded to get pull over to drag my sister out the car by her hair she was like 6 then.

Sometimes I think I’m going crazy because she says things like “CPS was never called on me so it couldn’t have been that bad” or claim she did  what she felt was “necessary”.  Last summer was the breaking point. We went to see the newest guardians of the galaxy movie and It was a late showing I had work early that next morning and ended up falling asleep on the movie. I’m a comic fan so I was upset about missing the movie and while I was in my room was thinking to myself explaining how I would have to rewatch the movie out of nowhere she yells out “ are u talking shit” I was so confused and honestly I snapped I replied “No…..And if I was” things escalated from there she got in my face I told her she can’t beat me up I know for a fact I can whoop her ass now. I destroyed her verbally and she actually hit me my siblings held me back I made sum threats boom she calls the police I’m in jail. I know I prolly could’ve avoided the whole situation by not saying anything but I was just so tired of biting my tongue being scared of her and her reactions. I have mixed feelings not speaking to her anymore I love her but I genuinely do not like her and don’t really think I could ever forgive her. But I often go back and forth with thoughts like did I overreact?"
"um yeah so it happened 
i was here before to reach out for help and haven’t really gotten anything but i thought id try again, im currently at work with no car because my mom took it back after i paid her and now im not allowed back at the house. if anyone could help i now have to go get new clothes and a work computer, i only have a place to stay for right now but not long 
if anyone can help in any way id really appreciate it "
"In summery , at 17 I dropped college and went into culinary school, my toxic mother loves to manipulate me and always mentioned having a restaurant one day. Now to modern day , I’m 23 now and everything she ever said was for her own personal benefit. Not only did she not discuss with me the restaurant idea , she has no idea how to run a restaurant. I turned her down multiple times . And it was the only thing she would ever talk to me about . “ money “ and “ restaurant “. My mother would intentionally stop talking to me if I didn’t do as she wanted. She would even come by around midnight , uninvited . Scaring me and my partner. I worked in fine dining. I specialize in French cuisine, one day she brought up a restaurant opportunity to buy , I took a look and said “no “ due to the fact that it was a heavily Chinese inspired restaurant and it’s had a new owner and name change , that resulted in bad reviews . Taking this business is just straight idiotic. She gets upset , some days past , she tells me there’s another place , I was forced to agree , and turns out it was the same place . She hosted a family dinner in public , that whole dinner , I mentioned ways to improve the place and concerns She takes it as an insult and lashes out at me infront of the whole restaurant. Till this day I still have mental break downs from that night. I packed and never returned. 
( the restruant she bought , only had one cook , it’s a Chinese place which consisted of over 100 menu items , it’s not the same culinary style I learned , and if this cook gets sick or leaves its done for , not to mentioned that she doesn’t want me to learn how to make anything and wants to pay me under the table and commit tax fraud.)"

"So basically I (13F) have been arguing with my mom (51F) over stupid stuff for the past couple of weeks and one thing that kind of starts the arguments is that she has anger issues and she doesn’t know when to stop an argument or drop the situation and I’m not saying I’m any better because I’ll sometimes do things that get her mad without realizing it. For an example, I would be in the living room with her while she’s watching tv and I’ll be sitting there playing with my dog and she would randomly get mad or start cussing at me for no reason. Or when one of my friends are over she’ll start talking about how I’m such a bad kid that talk back to her when all I try to do is just stick up for myself because I know that what she does isn’t right. But anyway what happened to why she thinks I’m trying to “break her and my dad up” is because one day after my dad (51M) got back from work I came downstairs to see him because he works all day and he actually likes to be around me. I walk into the kitchen and I start saying hi to him and asking him abt his day but I don’t know what or why my mom was mad about but when I started talking to my dad she started just getting mad because I was basically talking and she started saying how I need to go upstairs or get out of her face when I’ve basically been up in my room all day and thought it’d be nice to go downstairs for a little bit but anyway I obviously said no because she was coming at me backwards for no reason and after I said that she just started cussing at me and saying how I need to leave before I “smack you” which was uncalled for because there was no reason to be hostile like that especially when I didn’t do anything wrong. But after she said that my dad started saying how she shouldn’t be saying that stuff to her kids and how she needs to get some help for her anger. And I just stood there quietly not rlly saying anything because if I did I would’ve probably gotten in trouble with her. But after that I basically forgot about that until the weekend when I went over to my big sisters house to spend the night and when I got there she explained to me how my mom was saying I’ve been trying to get her and my dad to break up the whole week which I had NO intention of doing at all but apparently my mom got the idea in my head that I was and I’m assuming she’s telling everybody that and I don’t know what to do so if anyone has any advice I would please like it bc atp idk if I’m doing something wrong or not."
"This happened a few months ago, I’m starting to get more pissed about it as I think more on it. This happened in December while I was at my mums house. My father asked me where the LED strips I had gotten for my birthday where and they where in my room. A few minutes later he messages me with a photo of my room absolutely trashed. Shit everywhere on my floor and I even lost some of my rings that I had gotten on a trip to a cool place. I’m freaking out because he has gotten mad over stupid things before and he has hit me for it. I asked why he did that and his only reason is because, “it’s a dump“ that’s all his reasoning. I was asking questions on why he would do that and make me clean it myself. And he gets mad and says the same shit. I really wanted to snap at him then but if I did i most definitely would have gotten hit The next day. I really want to leave his ass behind but I really just can’t. the most escape I have from him is the weekends when I’m with my mother but two days just isn't enough."
"How to deal with life after adoption 

My parents were married until I was 2.
They got a divorce then. 
My mom and dad both remarried.
My step mom wasn't nice to me but my step dad was.
My mom was a crazy, yelling, loud mouth my whole life until about 7 years ago... 
she would scream at me and act ignorant all the time. 
I went to my dad's every other weekend... 
When I was 13 my bio mom and dad had been in an argument and I was on the phone with my bio dad and my mom said ""just ask him if he wants your step dad to adopt you"" and I said ok and I did and he said put your mom on the phone... next thing I know it's happening and they took me to a lawyers office and made me tell him I wanted to be adopted....so I was and I never seen my bio dad again 
Now I'm 35 and I realize this was toxic as can be........ 
can anyone help me make sense of this? 
I feel angry with everyone involved- and it's hard to have a relationship with my mom now even though she isn't crazy anymore "
And I relised that minus the alchohol and the thing about the mom that is something that has actually happened to me if I get hit one more time I’m telling a teacher
"Long time lurker. First time poster.

I was brought up in a middle eastern country so abuse of your children isn't really something discussed there.

I just turned 40, and outwardly I'm doing ok. In all reality though, I am not.

My parents were divorced. Dad had sole custody. Restricted me visiting my mom. Mom was no better either. Constant shouting, swearing every time I visited about how divorce had ruined her life. Almost made me fail high school because of that. 

Dad was no different. Just to give you an idea of how bad he is, his maxim of raising children was simple: children need to be terrified of somebody so they can fall in line. 

To give you an idea, I had an admittedly bad habit of nail biting as an 8 year old. My dad beat me up about it, then threatened to tie me up and use a lighter to burn each and every one of my fingertips.

My dad refused to attend my university graduation ceremony (from medical school no less) because I had invited my mom. I ended up not going at all.

That's not the worst part. The worst part was that this abuse went on while I was a type 1 diabetic diagnosed at the age of three and a half years old.

He would lose his temper at the slightest thing. Shouting and swearing. He once told me to get out of the car because I lost 5 marks on a math test in school. I was 9 years old I think. Threatening his own son that he would leave him on a random street corner.

He looked after me financially and obviously looked after my diabetes, but his verbal, physical and emotional abuse continued until I was too old for him to continue to do that.

My mom, as I stated, was/is no better. When I did visit her, she would spend half her time shouting and swearing at me and my dad about her divorce and my dad's family and her own family. From when I was 9 or 10 years of age maybe and up. She once took me out to dinner when I was 13 I think then slapped me across the face and left me in the middle of the restaurant alone because I begged her to stop constantly shouting at me down the phone.

These instances of abuse are not one off. They were a pattern. Beatings were common, with his hands and with sticks as well. I don't remember a lot of that because I suspect I may have blocked it out.

I recently went through some career and health troubles and those coincided with an argument with my dad. We haven't spoken in ages, but all of a sudden, something clicked.

Would my life have been different if I hadn't had abusive parents? Would I have made different decisions? I just realised that nearly all of my decisions were based on keeping myself as far away from them as possible. I immigrated halfway across the world and it still isn't enough for me because the timezones are not different enough.

I made some less than optimal career decisions to get away from my family that probably impacted my health in the long run. The common factor in all of these was trying to get away from my parents.

I know there's no point asking 'what if' but I need some validation. I find myself doing all those behaviors that adults who were abused as children do (constantly apologizing for trivialities, overreacting to minor stresses, blaming myself for everything that goes wrong even when it's out of my power). I would read these articles and watch these YouTube videos and say 'I'm fine. My dad and mom were abusive but I kind of escaped unscathed.'

I just realised, I am probably not fine. These are the instances I can remember. I am sure there are dozens more that I blocked out.

I don't know what I am looking for. Maybe some validation that it's okay to think/feel this way?

Thanks and sorry for the long post."
"My mom broke her shoulder and my dad has a bad Back and now I have to do everything when I'm broken to, I have cronic pain in my wrist and scoliosis that they won't send me to the doctor for even though I can't sit at the bus stop without a ton of pain and I just have to do it everyday. My birthday was on Monday (the 8th) and I got mostly money because I asked for that but they won't let me spent it. I've been looking on amazon for Bach and wrist braces but now I can't even buy that with my own money. 
I went to a residential hospital for 4-5 months for my mental health and now I get punished for crying or breaking down. I've been trying to parent my inner child when I'm still a child just so my parents don't send me back."
"Or to dread coming back to the house. Or to feel a pit in your stomach when it's time to return. The journey home should not be one filled with fear, and the first step inside should not feel crushing. 

It's something of a sleepless night and there have been footsteps and voices outside of my room. 

They're ones that belong there certainly, but it only ever reinforces that feeling of myself not belonging here. Like some misplaced object or a forgotten toy at the bottom of the bed. A home isn't supposed to be one where every second is braced for screaming, yelling, berating, and scolding; Where every conscious moment is tense and expecting. It should not feel constrictive and it certainly should not be so isolating. 

I realised today that it's not normal to get anxious at the sound of footsteps. "
"hey guys! so a little context, I am in high school and my mom has always been overprotective, but its really starting to affect me now. See, she doesn't allow me to spend time with friends ALONE, and idk why honestly. Also she comes with me to all my school events and dances and it just feels a little awkward since that isn't a normal thing in high school. She doesn't even let me cross the street or go to our neighborhood park alone. I don't think its because she doesn't trust me, she just wants to keep me ""safe"" and thinks the world is a bad place. I tried talking to her about I feel her being at all my school events, not even letting me go to our park which is a 2 minute walk without her coming with me, and not letting me hang with friends is bothering me and makes me sad, but all she does is yell at me and guilt trip me. What should I do?"
"Hey so I f(16)currently live with my parents and I think they might be abusive? . (Some background info) When I was little I lived with my mom while my dad worked away, I idolized him and loved him a lot and my mom and I had a great relationship.however when we were all living together I feel like he changed. He gets angry very easily but has never hit me harshly or without me deserving it yet I’m scared of him and his yelling. My mom also changed, I feel like she might be a bit..narcissistic …?when I was struggling with my weight issues she’d make comments about how she’s less fat than me (even though she’s more overweight) because she’s shorter and would get mad when I pointed it out. Not to mention the constant comments of her looking way younger than her age and how great she looks while she often insists I get a nose job and other things when I get older.My dad often calls me a dumbass for any mistake, something he knows hurts since I practically live for academic validation.my mom also often times vents to me about problems with my dad and his family, and how we hold her back from being happy. However the instance I could say they “felt” abusive was when my dad got drunk, refusing to give my baby sister to us and my mom kept yelling at him, I then had a panic attack and my mom told me to just “stop being dramatic and act my age” something they have always told me whenever I did something childish. They also tend to neglect a lot of chores, specially my dad, my mom does it but surface level only. I really have living here specially with how my mom just lets food rot in the fridge and drying cloths smell like mildew. She also told me that she’d cut me herself and do it way deeper one time she found out I was self harming and when we argue she’ll go days without even speaking to me. honestly I don’t know if I’m just dramatic and they’re good parents because in all honesty they do buy me everything I need and even more ,anyways I’m sorry this turned into a vent I just need someone’s opinion."

Using a throw away account, because yes

Basically, i am homeschooled 14m and i constantly get into an arguments with my parents:

1. Why Homeschooling doesn't work 

2.Or me talking about potentially having BPD since i every single of my problems and behaviour are matching it


They either ignore me or ""you don't have enough experience"" ""adults always right""

They pretty much admit neglect,but don't admit the fact that i am only needed to show off my ""perfect"" (cheated) results

And now abuse changed from emotional to physical, i have got hit for the first time in couple of years 

Hits by themselves didn't leave any long term damage, just a little bit of pain 

But still, i am afraid that it will get more violent or that i will kill myself, because i have tendencies to cut myself a little.

Child protection services aren't an option, since i live in a 3rd world country

What should I do?
I need a solution to defend myself physically and mentally

And a reason not to kill myself
Please help"
"Out and safe but only the tip of the iceberg.

No one cares or cared about that I was threatened with boarding/reform school/boot camp/TTI/mental hospitals/jail/prison to be brainwashed into a ""stupid robot with no emotions"" so they say that I'm cured and controlled and not be different!

They won't regret it they'll be happy that I'm a robot and not the real person that I actually am. They burn/break/sell my stuff so I can't break free and escape from them. Don't even think mom would know or care about it. They force me tho get married (I don't want marriage at all!)

This might last for years until A. I break free or B. I die. Maybe they'll come to their senses and see unhappy I am... no wait they WON'T! Cause almost all of them are Narcissists/Abusers.

Either a robot or someone who goes into crime. Neither are good. Afterwards they’re (my ex family) will beat me black and blue and torture me. Get the school to torture me. Try to get me to get “demons” out."
"Op here (22F)

6 days ago as of last year marks the first anniversary of me moving out of state away from my insane/abusive family. I want to not have to think about that situation too much anymore and move on with my life, and have had moments this year where I still mourn the genuine good memories I had with all of them. 

I've blocked all their numbers, because I cannot mentally handle reaching out anytime soon. I looked into the blocked contact settings on MSG and saw my mother texted me AGAIN back in late February saying how I needed to be a grown up and at -least- say ""f*** off"" instead of ghosting them. All that was felt was both sadness but pure rage underneath. I never wanted to leave my family like this, I still love them deeply - but I also can't ignore how they've treated me for the past 5-6 years. I'm not saying that I want to speak to them anytime soon, but I just really needed to vent because it's mentally exhausting to think about."
"I'm now 17, I moved into my dad's at 14 years old after being in a toxic household with my alcoholic and I believe bipolar mother, she would beat me, scream at me and kick me out of her house, I would sleep in my friend's apartments stairwells. She is much better now and I'm so thankful for that, our relationship is not perfect but it's better. Anyways obviously that would put an effect on anybody so young. Once I moved into my dads I started not caring about school, gave up on really everything, I wen't through a really bad eating disorder. And my dad was never around, not just physically as he was always working but emotionally too. I remember when I was really sick and skinny he yelled at me for not eating and said ""if you want to go kill yourself, then kill yourself"" and stormed out of the house, I was really physically weak that day, I had to use a lot of strength to walk, he got me diet pills at 14, I had a binging and purging problem he told me some days ""don't eat today"", we would fast together and at the time I didn't see anything wrong since I was sick, young and niave, I was raped by a guy that same year and that was the most hell i've ever experienced in my life, I would be crying and screaming on the floor and my dad got fed up with me so he ended up choking me, he's choked me a few times. One night after he did it I was crying to him and saying ""I just want my dad, I need my dad right now"" I was 15. No remorse, absolutely no compassion, nothing. When I was 14 I overdosed and he knew but he left the house quickly when he found out telling me to deal with it myself. He hit my dog in the face, and he was once in his way and purposely kicked him to the side, once he threw shoes on the floor right in front of his face. I feel like he really failed me and neglected me. He would never ask how I was doing or ask about my day or my friends, he never got me the help I needed, never said I love you or showed any care towards me. I feel like that really messed me up and I've gotten into some toxic relationships with boys, where i've been hit and emotionally abused and manipulated. I would have a hard time leaving, I just wanted love, I don't think I have ever properly gotten it.  This year and a bit of last I started taking school more seriously, I recovered from my eating disorder on my own, I stay away from bad guys and rather stay single, I don't participate in parties, taking drugs or alcohol which I used to struggle with, I just got a puppy so my days are full of taking care of him, school, working out and cleaning the house (picking up after my dad; I mean like oil all over the stove, random stuff all over our kitchen, stains and crumbs on our floor, he leaves it to me and i reclean it everyday). I'm also handing out resumes. I'm really trying my best. He always brings me down too by doubting me, my future, criticizing me. My dad was always mean to me but it got really bad this year. During arguments he will scream in my face ""get out of my house"", ""go on welfare"", ""live on the street, I don't care"", ""I want you out"" and i'll just be sitting there crying, I don't ever even scream back I just sit there hurt, again never any remorse or regret. I'm a christian and I started focusing on God when I was 16, he has really saved me when I was at my lowest. Today my dad he said I shouldn't call myself a christian since I don't respect him. But I swear it's not like that at all.  A lot of our arguments come from me bringing up something he does or says that upsets me, he'll just get so defensive and start screaming these things at me. For example a month ago I told him something he did made me uncomfortable and he got mad that I brought it up, right away he threw dishes at the wall and then screamed at me again to get out of the house. I was crying and he shamed me on a call with my mother ""you should look at her, she has snot coming out of her nose"". But in the moment I was freaked out and again I felt abandoned by my dad, that's an everyday feeling and it's really tough it always takes a toll on me. He claims that I'm the abuser, Is he right? he says it all the time and he gaslights me, he's forgotten a lot of things he's done. And why is that? I don't understand whats wrong with him? How could he do all of this to me and not acknowledge it plus make it out to be that I'm the problem. I want to get out of this house just as much he wants me to, I've started to actually fear him. I tell my mom all of this but I feel like she doesn't listen to me, and it just messes with my mind. This was a big vent but I really need somebody to just listen and reassure me and give me advice. I feel completely lost and emotionally drained. It feels like this has taken a part of me. I'm turning 18 in a month, I want to move out before he can legally kick me out because I know it will more that way. So if I leave it's better. I've had enough of what he has done to me."
"hi, my name is breyanna and im 19yrs old and female. im on the spectrum and ive always had a hard time learning things, like anything in school and especially driving. growing up my mother was very very physically and emotionally abusive. for the entire 3rd grade it felt like i was getting in trouble for something new and getting a whopping for it. idk why but me and my bio dad dont speak and i haveva step dad who is in the miltary. He has the same thought process for parenting as my mother. i know in there generation this type is normalized but that still doesnt make the things they did to me okay. 

my step dad used to tell me that when he gets back from deployment my grades better be all a's and b's or else he would take away ALL electronics from me for the whole summer and whoop me. Which he did and my mother did nothing to help me, she encouraged this. i started having panic attacks in school because of this and my mom would pick me up, whoop me for ""embarrassing her in front of those white people"" and then take me back to school and force me to act like everything was okay.

in school i finally got a job and one of the first things i bought with my paycheck was a bullet vibrator. one random night my mom decidedl to go through my room while i was washing the dishes and she found it. and when she found it she screamed bloody horror. she immediately called me upstairs and she proceeded to scream at the top of herblungs and embarrass me in front of all my siblings and my step dad. this went on for atleast 7 hours. she went through my phone and showed all my siblings and my step dad the n*de photos i sent to my secret bf. and she proceeded to bullie me for YEARS for that. every chance she got, wether if i was taking out the trash or working a 8 hour shift it didnt matter. she would completly trashbmy room to see if i bought anymore. She forced me to read the entire bible and forced me to go to chruch every sunday. even now at 19 she still brings it up til this day and shames me about  my sexual personal perfectly normal habits. 
theres wayyyy more tramautic things that happened to me but these are def core memories. now im 19 unemployed. my parents are refusing to teach me how to drive, my mom lost my ssc card, i dont have a id and i have zero money, zero savings. they refuse to take me to any job interviews i have to do everything myself. im depressed and exhausted.

"Hi all, 17F here, After suffering a lot of childhood abuse  with my mother I moved into my father's a couple of years ago. 

- I have 3 younger siblings at my dad's house

Recently I have noticed that both him and his partner will slap the kids as a form of discipline but it is quite frequent and I think uncalled for. I know in England it's not illegal to slap your kid ""within reasonable punishment"" but I'm not sure what's reasonable anymore.


A few other things:
- my dad hits the dogs quite frequently and my sister copied one day, he said that he would drag her by hair her if she did it
- my parents don't listen to my brothers ( who have additional needs ) when they're trying to talk to them. They tell the boys to ""just shut up and get out of my face""
- they will quite frequently scream and swear and the kids


I'm really struggling on what to do here. I feel responsible for my siblings they are all younger and as previously mentioned have SEN needs. I don't know whether this is just normal or it's becoming abusive behaviour.

And if it is I don't know what to do about it.
Would you say this is abuse ? Do you have any advice on what to do next? "
"He didn't urinate for over 24 hours and when he got to the hospital they had to hook him up to an IV because he was so dehydrated. She's telling me this story like, what am I supposed to think?"
"Welcome to the Moran household.

Wife is pregnant, previously there were plans for my father and stepmother to come down prior to the birth to get things in motion ahead of time, as we aren't that close (see my father once a year and haven't seen my step mother since 2012 due to mental/emotional abuse and manipulation when I was a kid/teenager). The rest of my family I see once in a blue moon, due to various other in fighting which happens every time we have a meet up.

Sent a message recently stating that; although I ""now"" understand that my stepmother was like that due to abuse suffered by her by her own family, and that was not her fault (she was sexually/physically and mentally abused by her father and brother)

....it WAS her responsibility to stop that shit there and then, and not pass that shit forward. 

My wife has her concerns because any time my stepmother comes up in a conversation between us...why whole demeanour/mood changes...I become angry, bitter and vengeful and I am very different to how I am normally. So she is very concerned that a) if I'm like that when we aren't talking, how the fuck am I going to be if I'm seeing her regularly...and b) what is stopping our kid becoming like me.

So I stated clearly that is any of that past behaviour is directed towards my kid (their grandchild/step grandchild - any further contact is over... between her and my kid). I would add that I would consider letting my Dad still come to see them, as although he isnt always great, I think he is more of a victim of circumstances than a bad person....my mum died.of cancer when I was 8...and he had to bring me up alone...but he was always away on international business trips...and until my mum was in end of life care...I probably only ever saw him once a month...I didnt know who he was...and he scared me....always angry and stern...no time for childish shit....life was a serious struggle for him....and it wasn't untill I grew up that I really understood him...and now i know we arent that..different...which makes me think he dealt with some shit as a kid too.

That was a fortnight ago.

Still waiting on a response. 

My Dad almost always sides with my Step mother (because that's the person HE has to live with)....... So...if anything...i'm returning the favour, I side with MY family, because that's who I live with.

He says she has mellowed out over the years, yet now I've called her out on her BS, it's the quietest they have been towards me in years. So, unless I'm proved wrong soon, good riddance to bad rubbish. My kid isn't going to have to deal with the shitty childhood I loved through, that's for damn sure. They are all that matters now."
"I just had a lightbulb moment. *Wow, without abuse, my life could actually be this way!* Like wow. Imagine getting a life! Without pain, even if I still bed bounded, I could still have a relaxing and fulfilling life. What a moment! I wonder how others’ life was like."
My dad would wrap me up in a blanket and then drive his nuckles into my chest and hold my arms down with his other hand it would make me cry but he found it funny
"So basically, Friday this week i'll have to present an exam to a university my parents want me to go. I haven't studied at all, my mom told me a month before the exam that she would make me try out and she's given me a book and some notebooks a cousin and my older sister made when they went to courses to pass the exam to that university. But i really dont know if i'll have time to learn it all or the energy to remember even most of it, because I am having lots ot trouble focusing at all because it's really hard to feel positive or see beyond my immediate present  when it's really clear i'll possible be physically disabled if I don't treat my carpal tunnel and chronic ankle instability right now , and the reason I have these conditions is because of child medical neglect. 

For my ankles, my  parents didn't know/care that I've always had a bendy and faulty right ankle, i remember when practicing for school dances in middle school and when I was just walking like normal people do that my ankle would randomly give out and almost make me stumble, but it wasn't painful, it was just normal for me. i thought everyone struggled with it, it made me confused that it wasn't ever portrayed in media or in cartoons but i didn't realize it was normal then. i don't remember or know when it started, i just know it's always been like this. i didn't know it was chronic ankle instability i just thought i was always just """"stepping wrong"""" and no adult, not even teachers, thought it was weird i was always almost barely not stumbling . When i was in secondary school, one day when I was really struggling with my endometriosis (every first day of my period I used to puke a lot because of the pain that would only get worse if i wasnt covered entirely and cold got anywhere near me and that would leave me very weak,) because I wasn't feeling well and was very out of it, when i was trying to go down the stairs i fell on the last step and i am pretty sure i sprained my ankle. The only reason she let me stay home that day wasnt because I was barely able to walk, but because of my endometriosis pain (she could relate to my pain since her and my grandma on my mom's side also dealt with awful disabling endometriosis). I don't remember for how long, but when I went to school I spent the entire time skipping on one leg and walking weird like that. Keep in mind that this isn't when my ankle instability started, but the first time I can recall easily where I sprained my ankle, i dont remember any other time in my childhood where i first sprained it, just that one day I had lots of trouble walking because I would ""suddenly lose equilibrium"", but it was ankle instability. 
In 2022, I sprained my ankle again in April when we went to a water park in another state and my ankle, when i was going down a water attraction i must've hit something with it (idk it wasn't even really clear what happened to me) because when I got out of it, suddenly I couldn't really walk on it anymore. They didn't take me to a doctor, we just flew home the next day I think because i couldn't walk, I don't remember at all this time. 

In October of that year, i sprained my ankle again, and this time it was obviously a second grade sprain and my family was really awful to me, so awful it was completely traumatizing. I went to my mom's room late at night to hug my dogs until the anxiety spike I had that night went down (because hugging my dogs really helped my mignight anxieties, and my dogs love my mom a lot so they sleep in her bed), my mom kept nagging me to go sleep in my bed, and after my dog walked away from my hug I decided to walk back to my room, except I was really sleepy and relaxed and not really fully aware of my body and (maybe it was because of my chronic ankle instability again,) didn't really place my foot right on the floor and i twisted it right beside her bed. I stopped being able to feel my right ankle (,where i fell) and instead of asking me if i was alright the first thing she said was ""oh great now your father (who wasnt even awake when she made the comment he was still asleep) and i won't be able to sleep for the rest of the night"" and ""i just can't stop thinking about all of the things that could've happened (you not being injured) if you had went to your bed when I told you to"" and very meanly to me, when I couldn't walk and I was very vulnerable . Keep in mind I was like 16 years old at the time. That night I couldn't go back to my room at all, so I went to asleep in her bed and cried very silently, and at one point I stopped being able to tell if my tears were because of the severe pain I was in or the deep sadness i felt at having to be born to a mother and a family like mine. When I woke up the next day I had a huge bump on my right ankle, almost the size of a tennis or pong pong ball, most of all it was really noticeable because my legs have always been so skinny no matter what i eat. And yet, despite this, that Only week my mom allowed me to stay home and ""rest"" my father, older sister and mom made sure it was absolute hell for me. They were obsessed with proving that I was ""faking"" the injury and the pain when i did something out of muscle memory (like trying to walk with my right leg), and especially in the case of 2nd grade ankle sprains you need to rest for about 2-a month of rest, but she didn't want to let me rest that time, she wanted me to go back to school and not miss anymore of it, she didn't care about my wellbeing at all. 
I think the most egregious example of her psychological torture she made me endure that week, was that every day she came home from work she would force me to wear a pair of sneakers and make me walk from my bed to the wall opposite to it, this was especially difficult when it was the first days of my injury and they were not taking it seriously at all. During the evenings/mornings, she would come to my room and threaten me that she was going to force me to go to school the very next day, even when i literally couldn't even rely on my right leg and i was just so fucking scared because my school is very large and to get to my classroom and to get to the cafeteria there's a lot of stairs, even now and then i had to walk a lot to get to these places. Even after I went back to school, I struggled a lot with walking normally bc i had forgotten how to and was worried at how it looked, i felt very embarrassed all the time. 

They spent the entire week making fun of me for being in pain (not laughing along me making fun of me and constantly insinuated that I was faking it which obviously fucking pissed me off), trying to ""catch"" me faking everything, and even neglecting me and doing lazily the treatments, etc. The last concern in their minds was my wellbeing. 

I mentioned that they were not taking my injury seriously at all, and because of this i kept begging for them to take me a doctor so one could speak sense into them. I had to beg, several times a day, not only for them to take me but also toremind them that they were taking me to a doctor because they ""would forget"". My mom forgets a lot of stuff easily, so I had to do it to her most of all. me asking for help so insistently pissed her off. A few weeks or maybe a few months after i went back to school, she came to my room to scream at me about something and then she said ""you always ask so much of others, and then you don't do your part, you don't do what others ask of you"" in response to me literally needing medical attention because all of the adults in my life were being assholes to me while I needed their support the most and I just wanted to feel safe and like they cared about me.  

They took me to several doctors, because I always forgot to ask them how much time I should be resting and I thought, that if my mom heard a doctor say what I'd been begging her to understand, that she would finally grasp that injuries don't go away with time (especially ankle injuries) and that she would finally help me, but she didn't. After our visit with the last one, because I had remembered to ask him how much time I should be resting, she simply got back into the car and told me that I would be going to school next week anyways. Next week she only let me stay the Monday of that week

After our visit with the first doctor, he asked for a radiography to see how my ankle was and if i hadn't broken anything major. They took several days to take me to get a radiography, and I tried to be considerate and not remind them all the time but it's very hard when you're trapped at home and your only hope are the adults around you and how in pain you are. When my dad took me a to a general hospital to take it , he was very obviously drunk as hell and he even forgot to bring the note the doctor gave us that said which zone of my ankle they should radiograph me, and i they took of the wrong zone and not the right one (i think it should've  been on the front of my ankle , but instead they took it on the back of my ankle) and they took it to a general doctor who probably didn't know what he was looking at and said it ""looked fine"" and that was all they cared about the only time they cared what a doctor said. And yet I am still living with the pain on my ankles when doing things that didn't use to give me pain live laying in bed or having my foot supported on a wall or how much harder it is to sit crosslegged. 

My ankles have definitely not healed right because of this, i might have some form of tarsal tunnel or something similar like that 

Worst of all, my older sister was and still is studying to be a nurse yet despite this I was made to go through horrible medical neglect. Awful nurses start at home, after all...

As for wrists, I believe I might have some form of carpal tunnel or tendonitis or something like that. I got my right wrist injured way back in like 2021 when i was trying to make the very problematic charger of my computer at the time (would only charge at a specific angle) charge my computer, and it was ubicated at the left side of my computer and with my right hand I tried to move it and prod at it until it charged again but movements were very specific and tiny, also i was frustrated and anxious because my mom had just yelled at me, a very sharp pain blasted through my right wrist that left me unable to use my right arm for a day or two, and because i was still in online school I just pushed through the pain and instead might've also injured my left wrist too because ei had to use it instead of my right one who was out of sevice. I've always been an extremely heavy handed writer so it wasn't like it came out of nowhere. i was very scared of telling my mom because even then I knew she would either laugh in my face about it, find a way to use me asking for help against me (this fear was made real in October of the next year), or try to hit me in my wrists when she got mad and started yelling at me (when i was like 6 years old, we went to a water park with some cousins and when we were playing with a beach ball the thing people use to fill it with air hit me right in my cornea and punctured it, my eyes naturally couldn't stop crying bc they were damaged and when we went home and took a bath and my eyes still couldn't stop crying my mom didn't ask me what was wrong or anything she just slapped me in my cheek and my eye. later she took me to an oftalmologist and i kept an eye patch for a while while it healed and started wearing glasses because my vision was very blurry, this is where this fear came from) , or minimize the very painful and real injury I had. my only best case scenario back then was if she simply forgot I had said anything, or just not telling her. I couldn't write the same way, and opening doors and many many things involving my hands became very hard all of a sudden but i sucked it all up because I was so scared of my mom, we had a lot of my extended family coming over during the pandemic and my mom was very angry all the time so it was a very stressful time too. I hope you understand that all of these fears and more were validated in October of that year. that I wasn't irrationally afraid of nothing. It was all true, in the end

this is all ommiting the severe physical and verbal abuse they inflicted on me when i was a young child and lead to me developing childhood depression and anxiety (abuse which intensified greatly when i was younger than 7 because an older cousin blamed me for his abusing of my brother when he was the one doing it but at the time i felt like i should be the one taking the fault because I stood by and laughed with him even though I didn't know what was happening and I didn't want him to pick on me, me and my brother are twins so we are the same age and he is two years older than me i think, and then hthat same cousin tried sexually assaulting me in my sleep and raping me when he thought i was asleep when i was 10-11, i didn't have anyone or anywhere to feel safe so i didn't tell anyone and  just spent the next 5 years of my life severely spiralling, constantly feeling guilty/ashamed/anxious/obnoxious and depressed as hell). that year i was also being physically and verbally bullied at school so you must imagine the cocktail of emotional turmoil I was having. and don't get me started on how all this medical neglect has made my depression All the more worse. before my mom had ruined me mentally, but after all the medical neglect and reazling how much she had neglected me my entire life (i haven't had shots since I was a child outside of maybe the covid vax and some boosters, she only took me to a dentist until i was like 16 and that was to take out a loose tooth that had been in my mouth all the way back during my sexual assault and longer than that, because another was trying to grow there and it was. Very weird) i realized she ruined me in body too. That she ruined me completely and I couldn't escape out of it. she only took seriously my endometriosis because she could relate to it but when I had very physical symptoms of Something Being Wrong, that when she got mad at me and tried to prove I was ""faking it"" and I wish she wasn't like this. 

i am sorry if this is hard to understand, i am very much in a hurry and need to go back to studying. I've been thinking Bout asking her for a gap year so my ankles and wrists heal properly and like they should have, she's been taking me to see a doctor about my wrists problems (because she wants me to be a programmer because I am in my computer all the time) and i:ve told her about my Ankle problems, so I hope she takes me to a doctor about it soon too, but I don't know how she would react. i really can't look or focus on my future when the threat of physical disablement and pain for the rest of my life is always ticking above my head. i don't know how to put it to her without mentioning how much she has failed me, for so so so many years, and how that has affected me, without her not taking an offense to that. She gets really offended when we speak of her failures. I am really scared. i am so scared

edit: I won't report because I am almost 18 and authorities in my country don't care about child abuse, it's very ingrained in our society, and I would probably just get raped if they took me to an one of these child rescues center and i Obviously don't want that so don't talk about it, it would take a lot of energy and I really don't have any. I just want kind words"
Anytime I’m in the front seat of a car he does it so I sit in back and I hate sitting up front but I get yelled at for it and even whenever I broke down crying he didn’t stop he still does it it makes me remember what people have done to me in the past
"Okay, I've come with the terms of my mother being emotionally abusive and neglecting me but I'm still confused about other things and need to be more sure. First thing is, she don't straight up beats me but I've been slapped, she pull my hair, pushed my in fights, squeeze my arm until it hurts a lot and give me ""accidental injuries"" that don't look accidental.

  Like in the car when im trying to take of my belt she will ""try to reach something in the backseat"" and with me with her elbow a lot of times and laughed and ignored when I did tell her that. Other things too just like give me a punch by accident and being so much ""clumsy"" around me.

 She knows I was sa'ed by 6 years old but still do things like taking her clothes around the house and calling me to have my attention and joke about that, sometimes be angry that I don't want to change in front of her or even making rake my clothes to show a new bra or idk. Also since I was a little kid she would watch adult films with me in the room and would at least make out with my father (idk if more I was a kid) and later in life make sex knowing I could hear from the room at the side. She also when passing by me will grope my ass or like something like that. Also she makes a lot of comments on my body and my development, even to her husband.

So I need to know, are these other types of abuse too? Or just something else but not too bad?"
"I don’t even know where to start , basically I grew up without a father. I lived in my mother’s message shop in the storage room, I wasn’t allowed out when it was open and only had Barney on loop . My mother occasionally sent me to a foreign country with a stranger she trusted to take me to my grandmother . To which I spent half my childhood in . I went back and forth across the two countries a dozen times , and was never able to learn and master a language. My mother one day decided to pay my uncle a big sum of money and throw me into a boarding school in this foreign country . Which I lived in for 10 days straight and home to my grandma 1 day after. This repeated for a year. I was unable to communicate due to the curve of learning two different languages. My native tongue was mandarin. At this school I lost so much weight to the point I can’t fit in anything. The boys and girls where separated in different buildings and felt like prison more then anything . With walls having glass spikes and being locked in the room at night . Each room consisted of four bunks , no tv , nothing . A thick bared window . Every now and then the home room teachers beat the students and so do the teachers . I was bullied and beat for a long time . And every time I went back to that school after 1 day being home , I cried and was dragged in by my uncle and aunt. I was only 7 years old . I remember I cheated on a test and only gotten a %57 , that was the highest score I ever had . I never progressed a grade . One day I get a notice from the teacher that I was going home , back to America. From my mother whom I haven’t been able to talk to . She told me that I have a new dad as well. 
(To summarize it my step father was 20 years older then my mother and was a vet from the Vietnam war , throughout my life I was never able to connect with him and had been yelled at and choked one time even , he even threaten to leave us cause I cried one day seeing kids playing fetch with their dad outside my window, I went through 8 schools and three states , I didn’t master English until 6th grade ) 
No present time nothings changed , my step father became more understanding as my mother never changed , always saying the same thing , “ money” I left … and never looked back, I wish I could tell more , but it would be too much. Thanks for reading , I’m definitely missing more major things . "
"My mum is always telling me how she thinks I had an amazing childhood and how lucky I am when in reality she was never around to see that my father was abusive and that I was terrified of him. She questions my choice to go to therapy and tells me it's a waste of time. I go once a fortnight and she thinks I'm not ""broken enough"" to need to go that regularly "
"It feels like a way for my mother to harass me, receive piece of mind and an opportunity for her and her family members to contact me asking my whereabouts and to face them.

The police officer told me I owe it to her so she’s assured I’m in “in a ditch”. I shared that I intentionally abruptly fled the environment to a shelter for safety then was able to sustain my own home and now career, I’m much safer and better off. He did not care, his job was to “check on me and follow up with her that I am okay”. I asked how to prevent this from happening in the future, I mentioned making a complaint and he told me to call the shelter(why for giving him my address?). He said to pick up the phone when they call, I do not pick up no caller ID for my safety because my abusive parent utilizes that to try to get through to me.

It feels so wrong, it should be wrong for this to happen. I feel so unsafe and intruded upon in my safe space.

If I pursue a restraining order against my parent would this make the wellness checks stop?"

"I hate him. He’s not working, he earns zero money, always alone on his phone watching YouTube or playing chess. Always yells at least once because it’s not funny otherwise. Always hide behind the « im your dad » excuse to do absolutely nothing in this home. Can’t even clean after him. Let me explain:

So as I was cleaning the living room, he come home (from his only friend’s house) and he directly throw his jacket on the couch. I ask him nicely « can you put it in the closet ? » and he replies with yelling and telling everybody how bad of an education we got because I was bold enough to ask him to clean after him.

Today, while we were eating, my sister asks him if he wants a desert, he says « am I supposed to bring it here myself then ? » not gonna describe everything but just know that he made my sister cry and still continued telling her how dumb and disrespectful she is. 

I wanna kill him sooooo bad, is there any way of making him leave the house ? Please help me I’m being serious "
"i'm an older teen, male, and any time i'm in the car or in the room with my dad i feel really uncomfortable and want to leave, and the sad thing is he's actually the better parent (parents are divorced btw). whereas with my mom i deal with physical and verbal abuse, my dad has always defended me and been nice, fun, and caring. but he's been such an asshole recently and he just yells at me and puts me down sm to the point where i hate being with him for too long. he's never really hurt me physically that bad but i have had an odd feeling around him since a few months ago when he started being mean. it feels like he's staring at me or something, it's really weird and i've never felt something like this before. 

is this normal?"
Does anyone else  deal with loneliness/ feel lonely because your parents isolate you from others/control who you can and cant talk to? I do online school so that makes it hard even though I try to take advantage of the fact that most students are in my city and Its good i have an education. Dealing with loss in the family as well and just feeling down in general. I'm hopeful i will get better and I will get into a better environment. Any tips?

the constant gaslighting and general disrespect I've experienced since I've started sort of(?) rebelling against my mom has retraumatized me for a solid 2 years, and I feel very disconnected from my already almost nonexisting family. she has only rewarded me for my failures, usually only materialistically as well, and at the same time doesn't actually want me around. (perhaps because she knows I don't) I've had to spend most of my money I was saving from job hopping for years on feeding myself because dinner stopped being a guarantee, usually for me specifically. even that food isn't guaranteed because nothing in my moms house belongs to me except for my medication.
Its been months but I still grieve over the cat my mom gave away to someone else without telling me for over a week after it happened, because she knew I was the only one that cared about her. my mom has gaslit me an insane amount and threatened to tell my friends about the ""true me"" or whatever that means. (either that or send me away to some kind of psych ward)

I just feel invalid for all of this a lot but it helps that my irls help me during the times that I think I'm just ""faking it all"" or something. I'm talking to my psych soon and im hoping I can talk to them about these feelings.

"As I write this I’m filled with anxiety and dread, over the years my dad has made inappropriate and sexual comments towards me. I have caught him staring at my chest when I was thirteen/fourteen, blatantly and multiple times. When my mum has ever said anything about this, like recently when he threw a cloth at me and asked me “if it was my stockings”, he has immediately tried to intimidate her and got aggressive. By getting closer to her and completely changing his tone then asking her if she “has a problem” as a result of her pointing out it’s entirely inappropriate. I despise him, he repulses me and all I want is for him to get the fuck away from me. He has very high standards for me academically, I think he’s projecting sometimes and expects me to go to university-I do want to and I’m working towards it. But he expects so much of me, and so little of my sibling who is 20 and still getting an allowance from him. His favourite thing is to guilt trip my mum, me and sibling with how much money he gives us whenever we disagree with him. Including earlier when he made the cloth comments. I’m at a loss for how to handle this, I have been for years. I wish he and my mum would separate, but she has said to me she’s knows if she ever tries to he’ll get nasty as well as try take from her financially. The only way I know how to deal with this is ignore it, it’s all I’ve ever known. I’m scared. But I also feel like I’m blowing this out of proportion and shouldn’t be. I have mixed emotions, what advice can anyone give? Or opinions. My friends don’t know and I hope they never do.

"Palm Sunday, my mother passed away.  I live hundreds of miles away from all of the family as I went NC 8 years ago. She'd been sick for a few years, and I warned them all (and mom) to get her affairs and will in order. NOBODY listened until the last second. Nobody except my son's EX wife helped mom with Dr appointments and stuff. 
Cue the DAY OF & days after: Son's ex wife and my daughter (now apparently besties) took my mom's purse and belongings from the hospital. They were there, so they were supposed to. BUT They stole her credit cards and bank cards and emptied them, leaving $500 in savings because I got there too soon. They took all she had saved to pay for the funeral costs. My son and/ or the two girls went to her apartment because they were the only ones with the keys, and began systematically stealing the very meager valuables and pawning them, and my sister and I are guessing this was taking place before she passed away. 
When I arrived a few days later to get things in order, I found out that while I had a bit of help, I had to clean her apartment by myself. She was a hoarder, and I was overwhelmed. Nobody knew where the funeral was or what time. Nobody had a meal planned for afterwards. I took the $500 to pay for the food and the pastor officiate. 
After the funeral grandkids were coming to the apartment and just taking stuff, tossing everything here and there, undoing everything I worked so hard to sort. 
My sister was handed the whole estate, down to her ¼ acre and the condemned house/ garage absolutely packed top to bottom with more hoards. 
I can't even grieve, grieve the loss of a woman who openly and savagely hated me, abused me, and destroyed whole lives because of her self-centered behaviors. I don't know how to feel or how to let go. I'm a damned mess.
Now everyone is fighting and someone is headed to jail. I just can't :( "
"So my Dad has always been verbually abusive to everyone, he will go in a cycle of anger for a month and then go back to normal for a few weeks, except for this time, we havent stopped all year, I think he started at around middle of January, well it got really heated in january

I just want to know what I can do to stop this abuse, it's not physical, and I will make sure it never will be, but I'm worried it will turn physical with how he is acting

  
So he doesn't yell at me as much, more onto my mum, doesn't complain about my chewing being too loud, doesn't go off of his nut why there is a sock on the floor (he wants everything to be so neat and tidy, its ridiculous, I'm not being rude to you, but your house is a mess compared to ours) We can never have things out on the floor for an hour, if we havent touched it for a day, it needs to be packed up, I cant play my board games now as some of them last 6 hours and it takes a few days. He has been having road rage lately, pulled out on a taxi and decided to chase him, the taxi was in the right and he was suprised he was in the wrong, could have caused a crash

Said he want to punch that moron in the face the other night

Did a stupid cast at a silly boat while fishing only to take my rod and reel and have it scratch along the rocks, he is so particular about his items if they are damaged. I put his phone down on smoothed concrete once in the garage, he snapped, said fine, you can start paying for everything in a mad tone, 

And his snap rage or what ever you want to call it is getting worse

And about the verbually abusive stuff, he will just go so mad, yell at anything and yell at your face, say super rude comments, double standards, it's ridiculous

Little brothers 1st birthday, and he was going aroud the house yelling at everyone, cleaning the already clean house, and then getting mad that we ""wrecked his birthday"" because we werent smiling on the camera, we were all yelled at for hours, how could we smile.

Today my Mum asked him if he wants to go for a walk, he then says, are you telling me or asking me

Mum goes, just asking you, we were going to go out somewhere, wasnt sure if you wanted to come or had any suggestions

Dad: Well I dont know where to go, so your telling me to go

Mum: No, not at all, I'm just wondering if you want to get out of the house with the kids and I

Dad: Why cant I do stuff I want to do, I'm always told what to do

Mum: I'm asking you if you want to come or have any suggestions on what to do, not telling you

And it just rambled on, Mum ended up in tears and they left

And my mum never raised her voice, my Dad sure did, and he then fliped the argument as he always does and puts it all on mum

  
So in short, if we have a different opinion in his conversation, he will yell

He wants the house extrmely clean and tidy

He has some sort of rage, I get scared going in the car with him now

And he says some awful stuff to me that I will never forget

What can I do, I have no friends at all, I'm homeschooled so I'm stuck in the house, no where to go other then work, work is my only out

I'm a M15yo  turning 16yo"
"I don’t really know where to post this and I don’t know the age limit on this app, but I’m just super eager to know because nothing’s been showing up on the web. So I’m a female and 15 years old, my stepdad has always been a drunk since I could remember. Even when I was little he’d do things to my mom when he’d come home drunk like wanting to start a fight; but it never really dawned on me how bad it really was, I remember a time he literally took my mom’s phone and snapped it in half. Literally broke it into two pieces with his own hands, but back in 2020 the fighting had gotten A LOTT worse, constant yelling till 6 am in the morning, counters being slammed, and me being freshly in middle school I was still a pretty young kid and obviously terrified so at times I did call the police. Nothing so major came after that except a cps surprise visit at my school and at my home (which my parents yelled at me for…) but it wasn’t until my little sister’s birthday party that things had gotten real bad.. my father ended up physically assaulting my mother at the party and my sister raced in to help, but when he got up to square up to her too her friend swooped in and punched him telling him to get the fuck away from her. And of course after that… my mother acts as if the assault charges are ridiculous, now I thought we would be safe from this man and my mom promised he wouldn’t live there any longer- but when I returned from a visit to my sister’s not even a week later he was sitting in my mother’s bed watching tv with the most uncaring expression on his face, my stomach sank.. and I knew that this would be a constant cycle of insanity from there on. The dude never even apologized by the way or tried to make it up to us.. he’s one of those financial abuse people, and even in this argument he threatened to put us all in an apartment together and leave us. 

A week ago on the weekend my mother’s friend came over here to collect my dad’s friend’s money that he owed her, so he transferred the money to my mother who then gave it to her friend. But my father for absolutely no reason blew up and started yelling at her “that’s my money!!” Even when they tried to explain to him it wasn’t at all.. I was asleep for this and I only woke up for the end of it, I was told he attempted to hit my mother but instead grabbed her crafts and threw them across the room, he also slammed the fridge so hard multiple times he’d broken the shelves inside and glass jars… now I have picture evidence of this but I don’t know if I should share because the state of our floors lol, I don’t want anyone to come after us.

Anyways mind you all these times are from when he’s been drinking… all day. And recently the question came into play “is he taking something that’s causing him to react this way other than alcohol?” Which brings us to now. Earlier ago they had already returned from a night out of drinking and were fine!! Until we all sat down to just talk about things, my mother and I were taking and his friend and him were talking, she was telling me a story from her middle school days. And for no reason at all my step father begins to say that he doesn’t fucking care for her stories and that they’re going to bed, I turned to him in disgust and went , “that’s rude, there’s no reason to be like that.” And we went back and forth and he was like “so I’m the bad guy???” And I went, “I never called you the bad guy at all, all I said was it’s really rude to behave that way when someone’s talking, ME and HER were in a conversation and you interrupting the way you did was rude.” And he just waved me off, and I thought that was the end of it, I thought I could’ve slept easy tonight but no, I was alarmed by the fearful cries of my little sister and the sound of something slamming against the wall, so both I and my brother race in because obviously big sister mode I heard my little sister crying I was worried, I got pepper spray and what I did probably wasn’t the best solution against a 6 ft tall drunk violent guy but I cussed him out loudly saying “what the FUCK is wrong with you!? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?” This got pretty scary as I was ready to be attacked or attack him since his mannerisms when he got up were concerning, this is when he threatened the apartment thing too and kept pointing at my mom saying “you fucking bitch!” And all this stuff. 

Oh but during that I accidentally rubbed my eye and started to burn like crazy, so I was holding my scorching eye while shouting and crying. Eventually he left and my mother explained to me why he seemed to blow up which she was surprised and confused by, a plastic pill looking thing (it might’ve not been shaped like that, my mom isn’t very knowledgeable on drugs) with clear on one side but purple on the other, and when she asked him what it was because she had no idea that’s what caused him to blow up as he did. Now this probably just confirmed a lot of what we thought was true, and I’m curious if maybe this is just some medication or actual drugs and if he’s really on something that’s causing him to act this way. Any ideas???

(On a worse note: my tv broke today and I was supposed to be getting a new one tomorrow by him, but now I guess I can’t because I didn’t let my innocent step father abuse my mom in front of my little sister :(((( ) 

Edit 1: it’s the next morning and my mother and I talked some more, his friend had called asking what happened and she explained, to which he then said “Well our other friend takes something like that” she responded, “well what is it?” And he said, “Viagra”. I forgot to mention that my step father has a cheating past which caused the arguments from all these years to get so nasty because my mom would always yell about it when they were drunk, and I said it probably hurt his manhood but there was no reason to act in such a way regardless to which she then responded, “he doesn’t use viagra with me OP.” So my mom definitely caught him in something but he basically ratted himself out by acting in such a way. Normally when violent fights like this happen they talk the next morning about it privately, but he had ignored her completely this morning and left the house after showering and getting dressed, which means whatever he got defensive over was the fact he was most likely caught cheating again."
"Weird title I know, my parents arrived home from the club and my mom was really drunk, throwing up and such and my step-dad(for 9 years) was pissed about that, overheard my dad just insulting my mom over and over again and trying to undress her so she doesn’t puke on her clothes, then saw he closed the light and then started to hear a weird macaroni sound (ik dumb description) that started to pick up pace and heard my mom moan and realised what was happening, at that moment I wanted to burst into their room and start swinging on my step-dad but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, and just went back into my room furious and deciding to just ghost my dad tomorrow and if he asks i’ll just start spewing everything that went and is going through my mind right now. Not really sure what to do, just know that i am pissed and really don’t want to talk to them tomorrow."
"Hello everyone, I am 18M, I am from europe, I live with my parents and my younger brother (11 y.o) and we don't live in our country of origin but in a foreign one.

(I hope y'all spend a few minutes of your life and read this because I really need some advice/help)


 To get to the point: My mum never let me go out but lately (since 2022) things got worst. And now that I am 18 I want to leave but don't know how do plan it. 

Some context of the situation: The first two times that I went out alone was around 2018-2021 and that was in front of our house. All my relatives knew/know that my mum doesn't let me go out, that I have no social life and my father doesn't care.(When I was in school she didn't even let me go on school trips, except for one time, and that time my father and she followed me with their car on the whole school trip).

When I got to highschool things got different a little bit, usually she would drive and take me from highschool but when her car got damaged I went to school by bus, and that's where I had a bit of freedom and social life. 

In May 2022 I asked my mum if I could go out with some school mates and a girl and after I insisted she agreed, but she sent my father to watch me what I would do... Few days later my mum controlled my phone secretly and checked the texts between me and the girl I went out with and also checked her social media and my mum saw that the girl was a bit depressed, had a few tattoos, medium-short hair and a few earrings. My mum reacted by saying that she was in shock because I talk with ""a depressive punk girl like that"" and then she told to our relatives that I was part of a group of drug addicts (which it was not true but my grandparents and the rest of relatives believed her). From that moment (May 2022) my mum told me that I won't go to that school anymore but because it was almost the end of the school year she let me finish there. 

In the summer of 2022 my mum let me go around our little city with the bike. At the end of august 2022 I tried to smoke, my brother caught me smelling of cigarettes and told my mum. When my mum asked me about it I didn't lie and told her that I did try a cigarette. After this ""event"" she let me go out only when she would send me to the market (which is 4 minutes away from home), then if my mum goes out, she doesn't let me stay alone at home (starts yelling untill I eventually give up and go with her)and manipulates everybody around me... In September 2022 she took me out of school, I tried to go to school in September 2022 untill she did the paperwork for taking me out, but she didn't let me.

When my mum took me out of school (September 2022) I couldn't do anything because I was a minor, so I talked with one of my aunts (this happened still on 2022, around October) and she advised me that I should talk to my mum and see why doesn't she let me out and that I should convince my mum to re-enroll me in highschool and if my mum wouldn't re-enroll me in highschool I should wait untill I am 18 and then re-enroll myself to highschool... I did as my aunt advised me but no result came out, so I had to wait to be 18.  My birthday is on 4th December, and from September 2022 to December 2023 I didn't go to school at all and only went out when my mum would send me to the market or eventually when she went to out.

In August 2023 I started to call local highschools to inform myself about the re-enrollment in public schools and the highschools told me that they won't accept me in highschools because by law I was no longer obliged to go to school. So in September 2023, 3 months before my 18th birthday, I started to talk phonely to my uncle (my mum's brother) to seek help and told him everything that happend then my uncle and I came to a conclusion that if I want to be free, have a social life, a normal life, and if I want to continue school I should go to my country of origin and stay with my grandparents (my mum's parents), and my uncle agreed to help me to go to my country of origin after I will be 18. A few weeks later my mum found out that my uncle would help me and she convinced him not to help me anymore. She lied to my uncle about the fact that she took me out of school and convinced him that I didn't went to school because I didn't want to, and that she doesn't let me out because I only want to go out to go to parties all night, get drunk, smoke, and hang out with drug addicts. (which is not true). After some contradictory discussions (me telling to my uncle that is not true what my mum says and my mum telling him that I lie) my uncle said that he won't help me if my mum doesn't agree. My mother, of course, did not agree to go with my uncle to my country of origin. 

After my 18th birthday (December 2023), I decided to talk (phonely) and seek help to my grandpa (my mum's father, that lives in my country of origin). I told him that my mum doesn't let me go out, that she took me out of school, that I tried to seek help to my uncle to get in my country of origin but my mum told him some nonsense and he didn't want to help me anymore. My grandpa said that my mum's actions are wrong and that first he wants to talk to my mum and secondly that I have to come to an agreement with my mum. When my grandpa talked phonely to my mum, my mum told him that everything I say is false and that actually she didn't let my uncle take me in my country of origin because she wants to go too in our country origin and there is no sense in me wanting to go with my uncle a few weeks before she goes. Then when my grandpa asked about the school thing, she lied in two ways. Firstly she said that I lied that I didn't go to school and that actually I went to school, then when she saw that my grandpa didn't believe her because I was constantly saying that my mum took me out of school, my mum changed the lie and told to my grandpa that I didn't went to school but only because I didn't want to (which is not true). Then about not letting me out my mum lied and said that she actually lets me out but I don't go out.(which is not true). Then my grandpa said that I have to wait and go with my family in my country of origin and when we'll get to him we will talk more about the situation.

 My family and I arrived in our country of origin on 21st December 2023. We stayed at my grandpa's house and I talked about the situation with my grandpa and with my mum present because that's what my grandpa wanted. In the discussion I told him that the problem is that my mum talks to me really bad, that she doesn't let me go out, that I have no social life because of that, that my mum doesn't let me go anywhere not even to the gym or to practice a sport and that she took me out of school since September 2022. My mum would contradict me and say that I lie and that I actually went to school. My grandpa believed me after he asked my mum to show him my report card from highschool which my mum didn't have in any way because I didn't go to school. That's when my mum changed the lie (again), she said that I am right, she actually took me out of that school but because she wanted to put me in another school because I smoked and I was part of a group of all punk girls and boys that were doing drugs and that group started to influence my thoughts (which is not true).   From that moment everybody started to doubt what I say, except my grandpa.
I told my grandpa that I want to remain with him, he agreed and so my grandpa said to my mum that she must enroll me to school (in my country of origin). 

Around 6th-10th January 2024 my mum tried to enroll me to school in my country of origin but lied that I can't remain there because my school transfer paper was not valid and that there was no other solution but to go back with her in the foreign country to a private school at payment where I would recuperate the two lost school years by the end of May 2024. I didn't want to come back in the foreign country but we eventually came to an agreement with the help of my grandpa in which my mum lets me go out normally and she would re-enroll me back to a private school in the foreign country so I can recuperate the 2 lost years of highschool in a few months (from January 2024 to May 2024).


I came back in the foreign country even if I didn't want to. My mum enrolled me to that private school but is located 500 kilometers (310 miles) away from the city in which I live with my parents. But now, here, back in the foreign country, my mum again doesn't let me out not even for a walk. I go out only when she sends me to the market, or when I get my monthly haircut.  Whenever I ask her why doesn't she let me out she answers with ""Who said that I don't let you go out? Are you insane? I let you go out, but you don't want to go out"" (and that's what she says to everyone else...), but when the moment comes to go out and I tell her that I wanna go out she says ""No, where do you go? ; If you go out you don't come back; No, you won't go out because you go to search drugs; (or lately she said ->) No, you won't go out because what if someone manipulate you to suck a dick? / What you going out for? to suck a dick?"" (I never touched drugs, I never talked or was ""friend"" with people who do/did drugs and never will. And I don't know from where she got the idea of sucking a dick but clearly she got some problems...) 

Now, my mum sometimes says that she won't pay my private school and to go wherever I want, or to go to work to pay my school, but when I am looking for a job and eventually have to meet for the job interview she tells me not to go because we will leave the city we currently are in and will soon go in the city where is located the private school, or on the day I have the job interview she takes me out of town with her because she have stuff to do but actually she only goes to shopping. And again if I want to stay at home while she goes, I can't. She starts yelling untill I eventually give up.  
 
I posted once before, a month ago, not knowing what to do and most of people advised me to leave. 

I talked phonely with my grandpa a few days ago and told him that I want to leave, he told me to resist and not leave now and wait untill the school year ends which is in June so we can see what happens. My grandpa said that if I leave now my mum would again say that it's my fault, and that there are less than two months until June and he knows I can resist.

 I've been thinking about my situation and I also tried again to talk calmly to my mum and see what the problem is, why doesn't she let me out, why she indirectly or directly impede me to work... My mum answered the same... I see that this situation will never get better as long as I stay with my mum and as long as I am not independent.

So, in conclusion I want to leave, get a job, a rent and become independent. Free. I will do this after the school year finish (June) so I can have time to plan everything well.  But I don't know how to plan it.

How do I do leave? My mum is always at home with me so she sees everything I do. How do I leave? Do I pack my things and just leave without telling her? Do I tell her a few hours before I leave? (I don't think that is a good idea telling her weeks before because she will try to impede me.) Who do I tell that I leave?  When I will pack my things she will see,  so how do I do? Then, before I leave I have to plan where I will go. There are summer jobs with accomodation here in the city and the cities around, so I think that's the option. I have looked for jobs and mostly are in the city that my mum lives but, do I look for jobs here where my mum is living or in a nearby city? When I leave I am sure that my mum will call me every second and also tell to our relatives. 

Most importantly, I don't want my mum to have a shock when I'll leave.  (I know she reacts badly because a year ago after a discussion with my mum, she broke my phone and I just left for a walk. My mum took the car and looked for me in the whole city and also called my relatives about it. When my mum found me, she was on the phone with my grandpa crying, and my grandpa told me to not do that again because she could have a shock and there would no one to take care of my brother) So how do I leave?

"I made the mistake of thinking I could be involved in a decision that directly affects me. Not at home rn, but I'm going home tonight, which means tomorrow my dad will pull me aside for a ""lecture"".

Usually when this happens he'll yell a little and then talk down to me while I pretend to agree with his opinion and pretend like I was in the wrong, but my plan this time is to speak my mind. 

To put it simply, I'm scared. Last time someone truly spoke their mind to my dad's face it was my brother and he got kicked out at 19. 
I'm just barely a minor so I don't think my dad would kick me out, but that just means he'd keep getting angry. 
He used to use socially acceptable ways of hitting like spanking and slapping hands on my siblings and me as kids, but now that I'm a teen spanking wouldn't be considered at all socially acceptable. I wouldn't put it past him to hit me though.

It all feels so unpredictable, do I go through with my plan to speak my mind? My life won't be in danger from him, so I'd be relatively fine, and I'm so tired of walking on eggshells to please him and my mom.

My younger brother has two more years in that house too, how is he gonna deal with that alone?
Idk what to do."
"I'm 17, and have recently opened up to my psychiatrist about the abuse I was put through as a child. It includest threaths, hitting, ripping from my arms and hair, being left outside alone for hours, yelling constantly, beating as humiliating punishments for things like crying. I can tell more if someone asks but thats that in short.
Today, I came home from the library and my mom told me she received a call from Child Protective Services today, and they told her everything I've told my therapist. my heart basically stopped as I specifially told my therpaist I dont want my parents to knoe what I've said as they get incredibly angry for telling things about them.
My mom says HALF of the things I've said aren't even true and that I'm just lying, but I remember those memories very cleary. she accused me of lying but I'm 100% serious I've only told my therapist things I remember for sure.
I'm very sensitive and of course started crying and she just said ""so its all my fault"" and left. she also said shes done everything for me(she doesnt abuse me anymore, stopped when I was around 11 or 12) but she also takes 200€ from me every month for my foods. I'm turning 18 next month.
Please, please help me. what do I do? the CPS are going to visit next tuesday and I'm scared. my mom is beingg accused of child abuse and I dont think it'll ever be the same in my house again. I thought therapists werent allowed to share information I've told her unless its life threathening. she also asked me if I want to involve a police and I said absolutely not. What do I do? are these just very accurate fake memories or is my mom trying to make me believe that stuff didnt happen? Please help, I just dont know what to do."
"Someone was offering me a new computer (from another subreddit), and I couldn't get it despite being COMPLETLY FREE because ""it might not work"" and ""why do you want a hunk of plastic? you should get a laptop"". And they also got mad because my friend had sent me a little bit of money to get parts that it needed.

Not only did i have to explain to the person offering it that I basically live in a hellhole, but now people are telling me to ""just get a job"" despite me being disabled (I have some mental illnesses, some from trauma).

They told me to ""wait until (so-and-so time)"" but whenever I earn money from selling things, they take a part of it!!

People are also telling me to go and get it anyway, but it's not that easy!!! I don't know what would happen, but I'm afraid of what could. I feel like I'm in a cage.

What would anyone recommend, if there is something i can do?"

"i am a british muslim. At 18 my parents tried to convince me that marrying my cousin from my home country was the right thing to do, so i left to go to university far away (against their will). over the last 3 years they have done nothing but manipulate me and lie in a bid to keep our relationship. i travelled home this easter as i normally do for a few weeks to see my 5 siblings. Much to dismay i find out my younger brother is getting married to our cousin from back home. im astounded that he thinks this is a normal thing to do and ever since i have expressed my disagreement with this, they have done nothing but guilt trip me about not being there for one of the most important times in my brothers life and even saying that me moving out is 'against our culture'. i am sick of being made to feel like a disgusting person just for wanting my independace and disagreeing with blatant incest. this is so common amongst uk muslims and im tired of it getting brushed aside. when i return to university for the remainder of my final semseter i will not be returning home because i am done.

"My mother verbally and emotional abuses my paternal grandmother (her mother-in-law). She uses words like ""whore"", ""Bitch"" etc for a 80 year old woman. She makes my grandmother do a lot of housework from morning 6 AM till night 1 AM everyday. She makes a 80 year old woman clean her own bathroom (while continually verbally abusing her). She occassionally also physically abuses her (slapping, choking). This has been going on for my entire life. My dad doesn't do anything. He does not oppose his wife and has been letting this happen in our house for decades. He is a huge coward. 

My mom emotionally and verbally abuses me as well but not as much as she abuses my grandmother. When I was younger the abuse was worse but after I went to college for Under Graduation (UG) it reduced. Since 2015, I have been away from the house (UG, work and Post graduation). I'm living with them again and I feel traumatised by the horrors in my house. The screaming and the humiliation of a 80 year old woman. 

My mom emotionally and verbally abuses me too. And I can't fight for my grandmother because I will be probably be abused and mainly because my dad will not support me or take my side. And, my grandmother is super traditional (we are Indian) and kind-hearted. She will never do anything that spoils her son's name in society so she will not come with me if I try to take her.

I'm sick of this hell. I don't think I can do anything for my grandmother or for myself by being a part of this family. I have a job now and will be moving out in a month. But, I still cannot bare to be the daughter of that awful sadist woman. I want to understand what options I have. Should I report the abuse of my grandma and try to save her (given the above context, would I be successful?) Should I get legally emancipated from my parents? Should I file a restraining order? 

I tried to record the abuse as much as possible. I have audio recordings but it is hard to get video evidence because my mom is sharp and hiding my phone in the kitchen (where most of the abuse happens) is difficult. Some help on spy cams or other devices to capture evidence may be helpful.

I need emotional support and strength to face this and get out of this. My therapist told me to wait it out and not fight because a person like my mom cannot be reasoned with. How do I get strength? My culture has ingrained in my brain that parents are equal to God. "
"I just can't. I dunno how am I supposed to study and work when it's still ongoing. my headache gets worse, I have a job interview tomorrow and I think I will just disappoint another employer with my depressed face and social anxiety. but I need this job to escape this situation. I also need to save siblings because they get this shit too.
shit. "
"When i trying to talk about my family changing current job to new, because the current job is completly exhaused ( im young at the end of 20's), its just customer service alone and just more sitting, nothing intresting, monotony.

For example my aunt says: What do yo do at work then? You dont like to do anything at work,like psychical work.

If i talked about after job interview, then aunt said about new work like this: oh the new work is 12 hours work, now you dont have a full time job at your current job. After all, you get what you want in current job, you go to work later, etc, they allowed you go to school and finish it.

Ive taken half of the workload because i couldnt go to there even a day, but i cant find a new one at the moment.

Then grandma said that you are still half workload, thats nosense.. its not good for future.

Why they dont want me go better but to suffer in this workplace?

Like i have no one to talk to there, my  workmate is moody over 45+.. i am not asked anything and there is no one to talk to friendly things like how you going. They are just like why you are not in your place or what do you walk here.."
I have been dating this guy for 8 months. He knows me and my father aren't on talking terms but doesn't know why. I really want to open up to him about my childhood abuse but I am finding it difficult to start the conversation. I don't even know what to say
"My step father used to randomly open palm slap me in the forehead,(typically many times a day), and declare me 'baptized'. I think it was like a joke or something, but he was really weird and I never quite understood him. He had no religion or religious affiliations, anybody got any imput?"
"I used to live with my father who was very abusive and neglectful, I’m glad I got away but I think about why he did the strings he did to me all the time. It’s like my father wanted me dead and he had plenty of reason. I still think I deserved everything he did to me and sometimes I think I shouldn’t have left because I don’t deserve better. Is that weird? "
"Alright so I don’t know what flair to put this under BUT I need to know if this is abuse and I need to know what to do and how to get us BOTH out, not just me.. for context, my fiance, M27, has a traumatic brain injury, I’m F26, I have adhd and cptsd. We’re both DV/SA survivors from previous relationships and I fled my narcissistic mother in December 2020 and severely abusive ex in November 2023 (my fiancé’s parents are taking me in temporarily, not getting into this it doesn’t pertain.) I’m sorry if this all over the place..

My fiancé, Jesse, has had to deal with corporal punishment especially in elementary school, his dad would hit him with a belt and his mom would put soap in his mouth, a few other things but that’s all he can remember for now (remember, he had a TBI.) He was afraid of his parents as a young child because of it and has flashbacks and when his dad yells, he’s like a deer in the headlights, he freezes (and we suspect he dissociates but like we’re waiting for a psychiatrist to evaluate him, separate issue.) There’s spots on his body I can’t touch because it triggers flashbacks and he physically feels like it’s happening all over again.

When he was in middle school, he came to them suicidal, they dismissed him and said “what do you want us to do about it?” They’ve actively seen his SH in the past and he relapsed a day before he met me for the first time (we met really late June of 2023), he was even thinking about ending his life around when we met (he’s told me I’m why he stayed.) i struggle too with sh and his dad’s literally asked me if i was “done cxtting yet?” right infront of people. His parents know I’m a dv survivor and his dad’s yelled at me and gaslit me by saying I’ve said stuff i didnt say and jesse and i both know i didn’t say it and i told his dad i know i didn’t say it and he said “you were probably off your meds or something then,” his dad’s also said I can function without my adhd meds and that its laziness and im not trying hard enough. His dad’s also told me employers don’t wanna hear about my adhd (my medication is a prescribed class ii stimulant that’ll test positive for amphetxmines so yes, I do disclose it as a precaution and I also disclose that I’m asthmatic and keep my inhaler on me. I have a morning adhd medication and an afternoon one so disclosing it also puts that within my reasonable accommodations.) his dad’s straight up yelled at me and it caused Jesse to freeze like a deer in the headlights, Jesse dissociated (from what he’s describing, that’s what likely happened, i have dissociation myself and again, we’re waiting for a psych to evaluate Jesse.) and it made me feel so unsafe that I actually started hyperventilating and started fidgeting with my hands before i was distressed and his dad verbally attacked me for it and for not finishing my plate of buttered pasta which I didn’t take much of as I wasn’t feeling good and when I went to pack it away, he said “watch she won’t even eat it.” (I have a psychiatrist and am in active therapy, both were horrified by this.) Jesse won’t tell them certain things because he doesn’t trust them with it (I advised him not to tell them about the dv/sa but he didn’t listen and they’ve already tried to use that against him.)

Jesse’s dad’s like walking on eggshells, his mood can change at a drop of a hat. His dad, when he sent me into a panic attack, told me my dad who was soft spoken and mellow and NEVER raised his voice to me would agree with him raising his voice to me to which I knew otherwise (his dad and mine have never and will never meet, obvious reason being my dad’s dead.), I ended up saying “respectfully, my dad wouldn’t agree with another man, especially a father, scaring his daughter so much that she’s nearly peeing herself, he raised me that the minute the volume of your voice makes someone uncomfortable, you’re raising your voice to them.” (Apparently Jesse’s dad was raised with never raising a voice to a woman but yet..???? I’m a woman??? And he yelled???) I ended up reaching out to one of my dad’s friends who sided with me and told me he never knew my dad as loud or anything like that and that I know my dad better than anyone. (My dad had parents like Jesse’s, especially his dad, he didn’t want to be like that to me.)

Moving on to Jesse’s mom - she literally has said countless times “he gets one shot at moving out and he aint comin back and theyd shut all his stuff off when he does leave.” They dont give him info on stuff (hes had to relearn stuff like taxes or whatever cuz the crash), she uses the crash as a justification and constantly says he doesnt know how to do this the crash took that from him, wont allow him to make appointments or advocate for himself wont teach him anything wont stick to her word with anything and if he does ask her to show him she doesnt tell him the truth she’ll purposely confuse him (ive seen it), shes told him that his brains younger cuz the crash but told me his brains normal like age appropriate and i saw papers saying hes cognitively his chronological age, ive tried to help him and she terrorizes me like gets extremely passive aggressive (example: i had him ask for his w2 tax form cuz i was gonna file mine and i had a free tax agency do mine and she refused to give him his form and kept it from him and menaced both of us and stayed silent on him for days..? I had voiced the idea of him and i moving in together and she was like oh state insurance doesnt work like that.. uh i know 100% it does cuz my ex and i had to file that way and jesse and i aren’t legally married so in the eyes of the law were the equivalent to roommates and she tried gaslighting me on that and tried throwing a bunch of info at me to scare me and overwhelm and confuse me and it failed..) she also treats jesse like hes cognitively like his brother who has a delay but turns around and says oh jesse is fine. She wont respect his boundaries and jesse has been terrorized to the point where hes afraid to voice himself cuz he’d literally get the belt as a kid for it (its not normal to be afraid of your parents as a child as far as I know in my trauma therapy..) 

Sarcastic comments are a thing too from both parents! The meds thing his dad said to me, the “jesse is used to living a certain way he won’t change it” from his mom then scaring him immediately into submission by trying to scare him by bringing up finances and lying to him (she said he’d have to pay car insurance and some other vehicle costs? His car is titled to her and we know she’s not gonna title it over to him and he can’t file for car insurance if he’s not on the title meanwhile she’s telling him he’s gonna have to pay for it when he leaves? See what I mean? She’s not honest with him!) and gaslighting me.. his mom literally intimidates him and stuff to the point he’s afraid of stuff and gets overwhelmed fast and freezes (exposure to abuse can make ur brain foggy too, its common and i’m certain Jesse has it because I had it in my situations so I know the signs) she said she’d help him with his dental appointment and like said months ago that oh its emergent its emergent but like “forgets” to stick to her word and if anyone holds her to her word she gets passive aggressive and even more controlling (only reason she did anything with his taxes yesterday is cuz tax season’s ending soon! I filed mine 2 months ago and tried bringing him with me to where I go and she refused to give him his w2 and when we both asked for it, she threatened/menaced both of us and refused to give it to him)! Ive tried helping him and she found out cuz jesse keeps getting her involved im guessing cuz the prolonged exposure to this kind of abuse and the fact she keeps withholding info from him that he needs that im unable to get (i have experience with this it makes you feel helpless and you’re petrified of anything different cuz all you know is the toxic.) He’s not involving her in his psych stuff, I told him that he has a right to his privacy and explained HIPPA to him and everything so the only one on his forms is me for it currently. His parents literally wont allow him to make his own decisions and they scare/confuse/overwhelm/threaten/bully/belittle/berate him and if he does make his own decisions, they pretend he doesn’t know what he’s doing and won’t help him with anything..?

Jesse has aphasia and some memory issues from the crash and his mom literally wont help him with his words and belittles him (his grandmother, her mom, said it was abusive and mean and told her to stop and she still hasnt), they criticize him constantly, put him down, so on. (I handle his aphasia by throwing synonyms and antonyms to him along with some goofy phrases which get him to laugh and he finds the word he wants a heartbeat later.) Pre and post crash, if he made a mistake or got confused about something, they’d say “stop acting r•tarded.” jesse hit a deer in august or something and he asked them to help him file an insurance thing cuz like the car titles not in his name nor is the insurance they’ve refused.. and like his dad didn’t hear the situation out like hitting deer happens its life your kid’s alive, there could’ve been far worse, I’d rather the deer get hurt than your kid..hitting the deer in this situation was inevitable.. and his dad belittled him and even me and was like “i dont wanna hear it do better” and no one’s helped him file anything??? Theyve said theyd shut his phone and stuff off when he left too. (He has no current savings as he had to pay a credit card bill?)

His mom keeps calling him a certain nickname and Jesse told me recently he’s getting tired of hearing it. He’s told me and her before it’s embarrassing and he doesn’t want to be called it (which is why i never say it), take a guess which one of us is respecting his boundaries and voice - me. She’s said veryyyy personal info about him to me like the thing yesterday about how he were born? That’s just part of it? (I have a hard time recalling info as I suffered a moderate TBI last Saturday and chipped 3 parts of my skull so pardon me if I’m repetitive or vague.)

His mom has said other weird stuff and i notice she repeats herself about it all? If anyone says anything or does anything she gets mad? She was rambling to me about him and his childhood and crash and so many other things yesterday when we were transferring our phone data over to our new phones (I switched carriers and no, I’m not on their plan.) I couldn’t keep up with her and when I excused myself to pick my phone up from the dining room table she got weird even though I was polite and came right back to where she was? She doesn’t like people sharing anything about themselves or actually having a normal conversation ive noticed. His dad’s the same way..? They both ramble and no one can say anything at all edgewise? (Not like I would try anyway, I don’t give them much personal stuff about myself because I’ve dealt with people like this before.)

His parents, especially his mom, brag about knowing him so well but they didn’t notice he had a massive drinking issue and was very suic!dal just before his crash? 

Part of what i see is jesse is basically a caretaker, he has to remind them to take their own meds, they esp his dad, wont “remember” to do it otherwise? He literally puts their heated blankets on, organizes their pill boxes, so on (his love language is acts of service.) Everyone like his doctor, mechanic, so on, are friends with his parents? His mom literally refuses to leave the patient room when he goes to the doctor and justifies it by saying she “just wants to know what’s going on” and I know Jesse sees this stuff as normal and none of it is.. his mom’s said “good luck getting him to move out, he’s used to living a certain way” before trying her scare tactics on me.

They scare/try to intimidate his partner(s) and some former partners and friends so on have actively said that his parents scare them (they scare me), anyone thats not connected to them like kids from family friends or whatever its a massive issue and they’ll do anything to keep them away, Jesse literally told me he was isolated as a kid.. if they can’t control who he’s around, they’ll try to get rid of them.

Jesse has told me he saw them fighting like yelling and stuff pretty often? He ended up getting fed up once and slammed a door infront of them and only then did they stop because they remembered they had kids around them.

Jesse has told me if we had a kid in the future (not now obviously), he’s 100000% anti corporal punishment (he didn’t recognize it as abuse until I came along), and he sees the “you get one chance to move out because you’re not coming back after the fact” thing as abuse and he doesn’t want that for a future child. 

They dismissed their su!cidal child in middle school but expect comfort when they bring up his crash, especially his mom. I’m confused because she was not the one in the crash, he was.

It also seems like they have two different sides to themselves - the one people see in public and this stuff.

Jesse told me 2 weeks ago that they wouldn’t give him his birth certificate or anything?

They literally use the fact he gets confused and overwhelmed easily against him cuz they know if they manage to do it to him, he wont be able to say anything against them, he wont be able to voice himself.. based off what Jesse has described to me , it seems like this makes him nervous and he cant stop worrying.. 

I’m trying to tell him that someone doesn’t have to lay a hand on you to be abusive and parents are never done being parents until they die. He’z tell me constantly that he feels like he owes them and he don’t.. he had no say in being brought in the world, there are things parents are OBLIGATED to do and providing for their kids is one of those.. only reason they stopped hitting him is corporal punishment became illegal in our state and when he turned 18+, it became assault, he could’ve pressed charges and fight back.

Jesse has told me he never had someone who wanted to stay and wanted to really know him and who was able to tell him whats abuse and whats not a few nights ago, his parents have spun him around so much that he actually has a really hard time picking up on signs of abuse..

It seems like they’re trying to scare/overwhelm him and make him as dependent on them as they can so he won’t leave.

What do you guys think? How do I get through to him? Have any of you gone through this? What advice can you give him?  Is this abuse? How do I help him see this? How do I get him to come with me so he doesn’t have to deal with this? What kinds of abuse are occurring here if any? How do I help him see that this isn’t normal?

(I told him to come to a DV shelter with me because I might not be staying with them much longer because of my situation that has nothing to do with his and there’s a chance I won’t have anywhere to go past the 15th of this month. We’re both in Pennsylvania USA)"
"Hello, using a throwaway.

So someone offered me a compter for free, the only thing is that they're kind of far out from me (an hour at most but we can always meet halfway) and also it does not have a hard drive. I have about $260 to get one for it, plus a monitor and keyboard, but i live in an abusive, controlling household that needs to know every fine detail and doesn't approve of charity.

They'll want to know why someone would offer me one that doesnt have a hard drive to run, and how did i get that $260 in the first place (a friend lent me some to help me buy a computer in the first place)

I don't think i could afford a decent computer otherwise, (I don't have much income, and neither do my parents) but i don't know what to do.

Is there some way I can explain it rationally? I don't mind half-truths tbh to protect myself."
"I (15M) feel like I’m unwanted in my home.
Let me explain, When I was younger I did pretty bad things, it was mainly wrong place wrong time turning into blending into the crowd then doing said bad things which I’m not gonna get into, Nowadays my parents lecture me nearly everyday after giving me a whole chore list and simply forgetting seeing I’m doing school, a job, and trying to do YouTube all at once, and I won’t lie, I’m not the best at doing my chores, which would normally sound like: “oh he’s just getting punished” and would be valid for punishment, but my siblings do the same shit and don’t get punished or yelled at or even a talk, simply “do your chores” they have been doing this for the past 4 years of my life, constantly guilt tripping me like “you used to be such a good kid” or “your gonna grow up a disappointment” and then turn around and tell me I don’t need to rush into things and “be a kid”, I wanna get out of here as soon as possible, the looming sense of dread and disappointment towards me is unbearable to live in, but I don’t want to leave, leaving them with a sour taste in their mouth towards me, cuz I love my family outside of my parents, I don’t know what to do."
"Hey guys this is my first time using this, but i cant find anything on google. Im a highschooler, and i had a shit past. In middleschool i was pushing 225 lbs as an 8th grader. I dropped about 60 pounds through my freshman year through multiple sports i was peer pressured into doing by all of my family, and through the entire process my mom has criticized me. She always tells me ""wheres my sweet boy went?"" Or shit like that shes not giving me any privacy, and my room is a regurbished back porch, made indoors. I have no doors, the doorway is 2 doors wide, going into the main living area. So i have to change in my small closet or our single bathroom we all share. Just now i showed her an old picture of fat me, and she instantly said ""i miss him. He was always happy, and none of this"" she gestured to my entire body. I dont know what ive done wrong. I try so hard to be a good son, a good student, and a good athlete. Idk what i can do but please id love for somebody to help me out. BTW idk how to post so if its the wrong community pls tell me

"Recently, after 17 years of abuse, I gathered enough courage to tell what my mother does to me and my younger brother, soon we will leave home.  All my life I focused on the bad things she did, but now that I'm gone, I can't think about anything other than the good things she did for us, how much she loves us, in her own horrible way, but she loves us, and for the first time I realized how much I love her.  Separating from her hurts me so much that I wish I didn't exist, but I have to do it, to have a better life for me and my brother.  An hour ago I went to her room and I stood in front of her door for half an hour crying, I wanted to wake her up, hug her and tell her how much I love her and apologize for never saying it, but I didn't, I went back to my room, I just want to run to her and have her comfort me, hug me and tell me that everything is going to be okay, I feel alone, so alone.I feel like a little child crying for his mom"

"Im 23(F) living with my parents and a sibling. I have had enough for the last 10 years of abuse I go through, mentally , physically and emotional in this home. The disrespect that I get , the partiality I deal with in terms of being an elder sibling. Since the start even as a kid, my oldest memory is of my mother banging my head on the wall and my heading spinning before hitting the ground, also of the time when my mother pulled my hand to pull me closer and then hitting me so hard that my bridge of the nose got severely injured from hitting the floor. As I grew up , I continued dealing with the abuse. Sometimes being dragged from my hair and thrown out off the house sometimes being told the most hurtful things like “no one was happy when you were born”. As I crossed my teenage years, I realised how my parents are. My father is an alcoholic and my mother is a narcissist and often accompanies my father when he drinks. My mother being very dominating and toxic in nature, my father never took my stand in this house. I kept on tolerating all the abuse and he never says a single word to my mother bout it. While growing my father has also beaten me and said the most hurtful things. With each year, their behaviour towards me has got worse and worse. Due to all the disrespect, humiliation I get from my parents, I have been self harming myself since 2015 and often overdose of my prescribed anti depressants. Me and my parents have no normal communication neither they care to ask me how am I doing ? They also don’t provide me with any money for my basic necessities (for example my college travel expense or money I require to buy food in college) . And today they threw burnt food on my face after having drinks or two. I can’t take it anymore and I want to end my life. I have had it enough. "
"He has low self esteem, and does not know how to handle a relationship or communicate because of his parents. He has issues with abandonment and things from being emotionally abused as a kid. I don’t understand  what means when he says he doesn’t know how to handle a relationship or talk and I don’t know what I should tell/do to help him. What can I do to help him?"
"English is not my first language so bear with me. This will be a long post 😚.

I need to provide some context about my relationship with my father. He is a big red walking flag. My grandfather abandoned my dad and his siblings when he was 8. My father always says he has done a better job than his own father because he didn't leave (I wish he did). My father is the typical macho man who will start a fight if he is challenge plus he believes its my mom's and I's responsabilities to tend to his needs because he deserves. My father used to leave me without eating the whole day because he is so self centered that he wouldn't notice I didn't eat, he expected me to cook for myself while he had take outs. I was around 5-7 years old. I never told my mom but one day, my older brother who is 12 years older than me found me crying on my room and well, he found out my father hasn't feed me since he left in the morning. My father gave me a nickname, it means ""monster"" in my native language. If I make a mistake or don't agree, I'm called stupid, idiot, useless or my fav one ""piece of shit"". He was never there when I needed him and I needed to beg for his attention. I don't receive hugs and the rare occasions it happens, it cant be more than 10 seg. He has never said anything nice about me. He always fights with anyone of us (brother, mom or me) so everyday is like who will be the target today? He respects my brother more because my brother is a man and I'm a female (seems like gender decides the respect you are supposed to receive). He only cares about himself and he usually expect to receive the best otherwise he feels insulted. He likes to look at himself in the mirror several time a day to admire how handsome God made him (his words, not mine).

So before, anyone asked: no, my bf doesn't have any plans to get married because he is scared of ending like my father, cheating on wife (Im trying to convince him to go to therapy). Well, we had a fight 3 days ago. I cooked pasta and he said he should have ordered something because it was not what he was expecting. Mind you, he only pays the triple bundle (internet, cable and tv = $54 dollars / he has a pension for $215) in the house. I'm the main breadwinner since I make more money than my brother (we pay for everything besides what my father pays). I told him he didn't have to eat it if he didn't want to. He went crazy, he called me a piece of shit who thinks I'm more important than shit, he called me stupid and a lot of other things.

But I talked to my bf and he said something shocking to me: do you know 80% of your issues are from living with your family?. It's true. If I were living in another place, I wouldn't be going through all this craziness and it finally clicked. My therapist told me, you can love someone and they can love you back but that doesn't mean they are toxic to you. I (stupid me) love my family including my father but I realized I don't love myself because why dont I remove myself from the source of my problems? I promised myself than no one will be allowed to put my freedom in danger. My freedom to choose, my freedom to be myself and to be at peace in my own house.

I just wanted to share and tell anyone who read this: it's ok to leave, it's ok to put yourself first, it is not selfish. Its time to love ourselves and if you have to cut off communication or go low contact to be happy or in peace, GO AHEAD! 

I'm typing this while doing a budget to move out as soon as possible ❤️. I'm not sad but I feel excited of this new adventure so if you want to give me any tips about living alone, I'll really appreciate it.

"i have a LOT of trauma to sidt through with not just a narcissistic father, but repeated betrayals from various exes and friends.  my dad gave me massive abandonment, self esteem, and trust issues.  

i have made two of my best friends in college, and theyve been helping me finally process 18 years of repressed trauma. they do a lot for me, but im jealous; theyre happy, but im not. and worse yet i cant escape this anxiety, so i only ever bring the mood down.  they can only have fun without me

does anyone else feel like this? i feel trapped by his abuse, and i feel like my friends cant have fun with me.  i sometimes feel like putting my walls back up so that i can be “happy” again. help :("
"My parents are emotionally abusive. I defended them from my friends’ criticisms for years, but I eventually came to terms with it when I was around 16. I’m now 18 and I just went to tour colleges in Massachusetts with my dad over the weekend. I thought we had a nice time and I tried to be as nice as possible, engaging in friendly conversation with him and trying to bond. 

But on the car ride home, he turned off the music at one point and told me he wanted to talk. He proceeded to spend the next 35 minutes telling me that I’m a disappointment and that the reason he’s never that impressed by my academic achievements is because he’s disappointed in me as a person. He thinks I’m a miserable person who makes everyone around me miserable and I’ll never be happy. I was able to avoid crying until he brought up my grandma who died when I was 6 and whom I’d always avoided because I was scared of old people, since he knew I’ve always felt guilty about that. He told me about how when he was younger, nothing made him happier than making his parents happy, like when he performed at the Kennedy Center and all he cared about was that his mom was so happy seeing him perform, whereas I didn’t even want my parents at my school play (I really did want them there and cried when my mom lied to me that they hadn’t gone). And he brought up how he’s 68 and in the last decade of his life and doesn’t want me regretting not appreciating him while he was alive.

I just don’t get why I feel so guilty about disappointing a man who’s emotionally abusive. I want to make my parents proud and be an honorable son, but I know that I won’t be able to thrive in life until I cut ties with them.

Update: I decided to take a chance on my mom and tell her how hurt I was (usually I just try to keep my emotions inside at risk of starting a fight with my parents), and her immediate reaction was to tell me he was probably right. Even as I cried and told her that I just wanted her support for once, she said she couldn’t just pretend to disagree with him. I feel so lonely. I just want someone to comfort me like when I was a kid."
"Today, my mother asked my dad for help with some sort of media player which wasn't working because the subscription had expired, and there was a lot of trouble trying to get it to work again.

Unfortunately, I was dragged into it and had to act as the middle man translating what my shouting dad was saying to my mother on the phone. Along with this, my dad was basically interrogating me on why my mother was having issues with renewing the subscription (he has anger problems if that doesn't seem relevant).

I answered one of his questions and he got really impatient with me and basically called me stupid and started swearing at me as usual. This time I got really angry and stormed off and shut my door to my room so that I wouldn't have to deal with his shouting.

I could hear him swearing and knew it was directed at me because he was saying my name and calling me stuff.

It's 1am now and this happened just before we went to bed. I'm dreading waking up and I don't want to go through tomorrow as he's going to be really angry and bitter towards me. How do I get through the day without any problems?

I'm 15 and autistic. My parents have always been physical, the earliest times I can remember are my dad beating me because I was misbehaving as a child. Then it progressed to him grabbing me by the neck n other areas, also slapping from my mother, as well as shoving and numerous threats.

Threats towards me and my dog. They say they're going to shoot him sometimes, or purposefully poison him in hopes that he dies from it.

Anyways, I couldn't take it for so long I started cutting. I was sent to a mental hospital, but even then, my father still says I'm being dramatic and I have no reason to be suicidal. He's verbally told me before he doesn't care for it. 

I remember we got into this huge fight and I was actively showing him my scars while sobbing to him about how bad his actions and my mothers were hurting me. Even then that wasn't enough for him to care. 

I remember crying to him about how much I hated him and now we don't talk at all. That fight was only a few nights ago.

There's a lot more, but I can't get the energy to write it all. I will say though, it's emotional and physically abusive in my household. Between threats and yelling and terrible jokes thrown at me, I can't handle it. 

I've gotten so much trauma from it I developed a disorder similar to DID. 
I just need advice. I have no idea what I'm doing anymore."
"First post on reddit ever because i really need some help. If i'm being honest i have no clue what i'm asking, like, i know i've been abused but my mind is like broken from it and i have all these weird fear's and dreams because of it,

Basically, i'm 13 and i've lived with my parents my whole life and my dads always been abusive, he has like bpd or something because there is no way he's sane. He throws his weekly hissy fits and fights with my mum almost every night in their room and i'm so scared when it goes quiet. Like, i know that it's never going to happen, but i'm still scared that my dads stabbed my mum and he's gonna come into my room and kill me next cause he hates us and it's so stupid because i know he would probably never do that but i'm still scared shitless.

And also my taste in men is horrible. Like, i've never had a crush my age, only teachers and actors who look like they could hug me and tell me they love me but also strangle me and kill me if they want to. I just really need someone to love me cause if no one does i might just go fucking feral.

This is what i'm talking about. I need someone to love me or i can't function, i need someone to tell me they think i'm perfect otherwise i'm going to kill myself. It's these things i can't do anything about, what if no one loves me? What am i to do then. I need help on this, how do i stop feeling so needy of things my father never gave me? And how do i stop being scared and imagining the worst things every night? "

"She would clarify that she didn't mean *her* kids of course, but I think I kind of grew up internalizing this. And I would agree with her, because kids are generally loud and scream and cry etc, and I was a very quiet and reserved child, so was my brother. I started repeating the things she'd say about kids (especially jokes about violence towards kids who misbehave) and I would say how much I hated kids and how gross and annoying they are. I think it even put a rift between me and kids my age because I would judge them for acting immature, which was really just them acting their age.

I've since grown up and realized this is a very immature and unfair perspective to have towards children and no longer think this way, but my mom hasn't changed. Does anyone else have parents who did/do this? I don't understand why you'd have kids if you hate them, what if I wasn't the well behaved quiet kid that she wanted? Would she have hated me too?"
"I was physically and emotionally abused throughout my childhood and still to this day, though it  is less physical and less often as my parents are now divorced. I confided in my ex boyfriend about this, we had a bad breakup and recently he messaged my dad and told him that I had told him(my ex) about my parents being abusive. My ex never met my parents, we were only together for a few months. My ex was also abusive towards me, though a lot less severe than my parents. I am so hurt that he has told my dad this and can’t understand why. I’m not sure if he wants my parents to abuse me, or if he doesn’t believe me (although he has seen proof). Obviously this has made thing a million times worse between me and my parents and my dad has started being physically abusive again. I never thought I would want to tell the police but I am now debating it however I’m scared I will be come homeless (I’ve only just graduated from university) "

"Ive delt with abuse my whole life, im 19 now and my parents split apart when i was 17, they were both abusive onto me but was better when they split. My dad was emotionally abusive and physically. I dont visit him often because of how toxic and narcissistic asshole he is, I've debated cutting him out many times and havent gone full through with it in hopes he would change. Which he hasn't in the slightest.


I can't even be my own person without him criticising me for the way i look, the way i dress, judging my lifestyle and puts me down for not staying at certain jobs, the list goes on but he's such a negative and toxic influence on my life and I've reached my breaking point. Im no longer going to let him abuse me mentally any further.


My grandpa on my dads side is creepy disgusting man. He makes inappropriate jokes and comments towards me and comments like "" oh i like your body take a spin around"", and got upset at me when i told him i didn't want to go dress shopping with him. I've told my dad about this and he's defended him saying "" oh hes old he doesn't know what hes saying"" and put the blame onto me that im in the wrong and i should understand. 



My mum doesn't understand how this effects me and expects me to come to events and that its rude not to because it's family and shit. I'm done putting other people first before me and going to family events to please my family, i want to put my mental health first and prioritise my needs.

"Do they act this way to their friends when they mess up? If they didn't have a child, would they be happier? Why would they have a child if they know it can be a hassle? If they hide this behavior in public, why do they only act out on us? Are they doing it intentionally, were they treated like this as a child, or do they think it's regular parenting? If they weren't treated like this when they were a child, how did they end up becoming this way? So many questions, very few answers."
"First post here. Sorting some things out in my adult years and wanted to know if I was overreacting to some memories, or if my stepfather emotionally abused me. 

I was a pretty good athlete growing up. Probably DI-AA level. My stepfather was a big basketball guy and wanted me to play as well. I was pretty good, and probably could have gotten a scholarship had I cared enough. I told my parents that I didn’t want to play anymore when I was about 14, and my dad threatened to not allow me to play other sports that I enjoyed if I didn’t play basketball. He also told me that if I didn’t play basketball that he wouldn’t pay for my college or help me in any way financially despite making about $500k per year.

I ended up getting cut from my high school basketball team right before my senior year (after a talk with my coach who saw what this was doing to me). I was a pretty angry teenager and definitely pushed my luck with some poor decision making. Luckily, I had excellent grades and ended up going to college at UNC (ironically, a basketball school). I graduated with about $90k in student loan debt, because I didn’t qualify for any federal aid (stepdads income) and zero help from my parents. 

I feel like I’m on the right track with my life now, but I’ve been emotionally withdrawn and have a hard time connecting with people. I have a great job and even managed to pay off my student loans. Despite turning parts of my life around, I still feel kind of messed up over the whole thing. 

Was I emotionally abused?"
"Hi I’ll keep myself anonymous for this but im non binary and 17. My mom makes me feel like im not even important to her by the way she constantly belittles me but then expects for me to love her.

I dont think my own father even loves me anymore he laughed when i told him i love him yesterday. Today at 7:00pm my mom asked for me to go to the store for her then gets mad at me for when i call her to confirm what she wants, I ended up getting what she wanted after she screamed at me. I honestly believe that this is my sign to end my life my career isnt important anyways. I dont feel wanted anywhere i go im sick of my life and sooner or later ill write a suicide note and right it in my blood since she wants to keep treating me like im an object.

"Long Post!! TLDR; My mom got drunk, had sex with my dad and then psychically assaulted me now she is telling everyone a different story and I’m starting to doubt if I’m in the right here 
 
**Edit! I have made two separate posts from this with what the Facebook post was and a couple of images of some of her abuse towards me dating back to 2021**

(I am posting this on behalf of my younger sister as she can’t get into her own reddit account for anyone who saw my own personal post about her!!) 

**Me (Just turned F18), Mom (48), Dad (56), Sister (19) and Hailee (Older sister, 30)**

Hey guys, I am coming here for advice because I would like to know if I'm the asshole or not.

I would like to open this by clarifying my mom and I don't have a good relationship- She abused me while she was on drugs and has been psychically violent my whole life. Towards me, my sister, her other children and my father. I was removed from her care at a young age due to her psychical violence and history with drugs. All of her children stay with her own mother for the reason she has abused them as well and my sister and I stay with our dad.

I have worked through many of my issues regarding the past- I would say I am over it now. What happened has happened and the future and present are what matters to me. However, what I am not over is the fact her behaviours have still carried into the present. She is still extremely psychically violent. Is it really 'not letting go of the past' if it's still happening?

The other night, my mom came over at around 2:30 AM, her cat was sick and was going to be put down at 9 AM, so we wanted to let her spend the night with her cat before she had to say goodbye.

My mom started drinking. She kept telling my friend to drink as well although she really didn't want to. I had two cans with her and that was it. My dad asked my mom to stop drinking and she started screaming at him about not telling her what to do. My friend witnessed this and was extremely uncomfortable and I was incredibly embarrassed.

Anyway, they went to the vet and I stayed home with my friend, I'm not sure what happened between then but they came home seeming okay, they had to go down town so my sister and I hung out with our friend until they left. They went down town for about eight hours and my mom came back with more alcohol.

Okay whatever, she is a grown woman and is responsible for herself- If she wants to drink knowing it doesn't agree with her, that's her choice. We tried asking her to stop and it didn't go down well.

I had been attempting to sleep, but all I could hear was her crying and rambling, probably drunk although I am not sure, I don't want to claim she was in case she wasn't. 

Then I could hear her yelling and my dad asking her to stop and so obviously I got up and no, I shouldn't have, but I was sick of arguing at this point and I told her to shut the fuck up, which maybe wasn't the right move but during our other arguments that night she also spoke to me incredibly disrespectfully and I told her if she wasn't going to talk to me respectfully then I don't see why I should have to talk to her respectfully.

I know some people believe you should talk to your parents respectfully anyway but I am an adult now and believe I have the right to ask for respect from her, especially if she wants it in return.

Something she also firmly believes and tells me all the time but doesn't uphold for herself.

She said sorry and we calmed down and everything was fine and I went back to my room to attempt to sleep again, fell asleep for a bit and woke up to very loud sex.

Okay. Adults have sex. That's fine.

I told them I could hear them and told them to keep it down. They acknowledged me but did not keep it down. I could hear them acknowledging that I could hear them. So l decided I'd ring my nan and ask if me and my sister could sleep there and yes, I did tell my nan why and what was happening, and I did explain I wasn't really bothered by the sex itself, just annoyed that they knew I could hear and was trying to sleep but still didn't keep it down. I was completely willing to not say anything else and just rant to my grandmother as l packed up.

It was my mother who came out yelling at me, despite my dads protest and asking her not to because I was leaving with my sister anyway, but she came out yelling at me and insulting me, telling me I sook about everything and to shut the fuck up. I told her to leave me alone and they were dirty. Probably not the best move but I was incredibly sick of her yelling at this point. She kept getting in my face and I told her to get the fuck out of my face and so did my sister. 

She said 'What'll you do if I don't?' and I said 'I'll show you what l'll do' and I had intentions on ringing the police on her because I wanted her removed from the house because I was unbelievably fed up with the arguing. 

She grabbed me first, she is swearing black and blue that she didn't but she did grab me first so I obviously retaliated, I am not a minor anymore and you cannot put your hands on me without it being assault, I am allowed to defend myself, so l hit her once and shoved her to get her off of me and she would not get off me-She had me by the back of the hair, dragging me up the hallway and she slammed my head into the wall three times, my dad has come out and pulled her off of me and I have told her I was ringing the police on her for putting her hands on me.

 She, with the knowledge the police were on the phone, was still screaming at me and the operator could hear her.
So they pretty much rushed there and I told them what happened.

The officer could literally hear her calling me names and whispering things about me, and so could I, insulting me saying I'm a stupid little cunt of a kid and etc. I went down to the station to make a statement and got an AVO on her.

Or well, was more or less told there was an AVO being put on her. I think because they heard how she was acting they were required to for my protection. I'm not sure how it works. She can't come near me now but she has posted about me on social media and not told the full truth.

I really want to know if I'm in the wrong here, should I have rang the police on her? I have videos and heaps of evidence regarding her behaviour that I have also shown the police hence the AVO I believe, she has claimed my oldest sister Hailee came up yelling about how disgusting she was even though that did not happen, my sister was having a mad laugh and thought the situation was funny, I am not sure why she feels the need to lie. I believe my mom only tells people what she wants them to hear.

She is trying to have me charged with assault even though I did not assault her, only defended myself.
Just like every other time she has hit me and I have defended myself or when she has hit my dad and I have defended him. 

This is probably going to be a stupid question to anyone with an outside view but- Am I wrong here? I am constantly being told by her that I have no sympathy for her, I don't support her mental issues, I don't love her for who she is, I think she is getting into my head, I just want to know any non bias opinions and thoughts.

My dad is on my side, so is my nan, and my sister (19) but I'm not sure about my other sister (30.)

She always tends to believe my mom because my mom cries to her and makes her feel bad. At least that's what I think she does. My mom has blatantly lied about me to the police and to my sister- Claiming she is going to charge for me for lying about being molested as a child?? 

Which is a low blow seeing as she knew how that event affected me as a child. She cannot prove I lied about that, it happened when I was eight and also she has no evidence?? And I'm pretty sure she cannot charge me for that at all??

She has been this way for as long as I remember having sentience, I have only just turned eighteen on the 25th of March and I am at a loss of what to do legally and morally- I know she cannot come near me due to the AVO but I'm starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong here somehow. I am sorry if this is a stupid question but I am really lost and starting to doubt myself.

I feel like this is on me for even letting her come up to begin with.

So am I at fault/the asshole?"
"My abusive dad threatened to kill me and my dog, then said my mum couldn’t protect me because last night he thought I ate his food. He’s been hitting the dog and threw a cup at me. He said if I told my mum I’d be dead by dawn. I’m fucking scared. He hurt the dog awhile ago and we ended up taking him to the vet, his leg was paralysed for a few months. I knew my dad wouldn’t hurt us but after he did that to the dog I’ve been avoiding him at all costs. I’ve had to take care of my little brother too, who’s autistic and can’t handle when my dad yells at my mum. I know I should call the police, I have tried once, but he caught me. I don’t know what to do.

I need she told me to go to Hell before. More than once. But I don’t know if she ever said burn in hell (does it matter?)

She has screamed and cuss me out many times and then gaslights about it.

Any thoughts on this?

"My abuse by my own father began 37 years ago. It was the springtime when it began. I remember because it was past spring break at school. I was in the 4th grade. 

That’s when my father called me to bathroom in my parents bedroom. he was naked and touching himself. That’s when it began. That’s definitely not when it ended though.  I only wish I could say it was a one time thing. 

I think that’s what angers me the most. And why I can’t forgive him. Because it wasn’t a one time thing or a misunderstanding or whatever bullshit. It was a regular and deliberate occurrence at least weekly. Anytime that I was home alone with him was a time I could have been molested. I dreaded time off with him during summer break or whenever my mother wasn’t around. 

My mother worked and my father knew exactly when she’d be home and often times when he’d molest me he would be completely naked except for his Casio watch so he wouldn’t lose track of time. It was deliberate and calculated. 

He’d attempt to entice me with pornography.
Dirty magazines, hard core porn movies, etc. I was 9 when he started doing this. I was still playing with toys and not aware of anything like that. I had no understanding of what was going on in those movies. Showing me porn became a routine to try and excite me into participating and then touching him or performing acts. I absolutely wanted to vomit before during and afterwards. 

When I was 10-11 I began to have pain in my gut. I would get severe anxiety and would become nauseous and throw up. My mother assumed from too much junk food. In reality it was because I dreaded my father assaulting me further. 

When I was 15 I was caught shoplifting a dirty magazine at a video store. My mother picked me up. She yelled at me for embarrassing her and for doing something so disgusting. She told me how perverse these magazines were. The police officer who detained me shamed me for this too as did the probation officer I was assigned to. 

I wanted to tell everyone who i developed a porn habit from. That it was my father who showed me every piece of filth he could find. By the time I was 12 I knew who most of the major porn stars of the day were. I should have said something when I was asked by the police, my probation officer and especially my mother but I didn’t. 

As part of my probation I did weed and litter pickup for the city every Saturday for a month. All that for a 5 dollar copy of penthouse magazine. I quietly did my penance to society and accepted a lifetime ban from the video store and didn’t say shit.

Of course I wasn’t going to say shit. my father was a man with a violent temper. He had beat me several times before so there was no way I’d ever say anything. He’d also conditioned me (groomed me) that this was normal behavior between fathers and their children. 

I was barely able to bring any of this up a year ago. I think acknowledging what happened was good for me. I’ve also spoken with a couple of survivor groups. I won’t say I’m better, but I think I’m starting to deal with it better. Getting it out helps."
"  My mom has controlled and micromanaged me for years. I haven't been able to have a normal, happy childhood because of her and my dad. Every day, I'm always hounded about the slightest thing I do wrong and am often cussed out about it.

  She gets drunk often and will violently scream at me for whatever reason she may have, which she is tonight. She's had this problem for years and nothing I have done has helped. 

 She's gone as far as to ruin a perfectly fine relationship I had with a girl I loved dearly for two years. My mother would, every day, scream at me about how much she hated my girlfriend because she believed that my girlfriend was manipulating me and trying to take me away from my family, when that clearly wasn't the case. My girlfriend ended up leaving me last month because the stress of having to deal with my mother was too much for her.

  My mental health is in shambles, I hardly have any friends and my relationship is ruined.  I absolutely have to move out as soon as possible as it's getting worse every day, but I have no clue where to start! I can't get a job and work while I'm still at home because my parents will not allow me to have a job while I'm still living here, so I cant save up any money.

 I have thought this through very thoroughly, and I am set on moving out. I just don't know where to start considering I have no income. This is the only place I feel I can turn to, and any advice would be appreciated.

)Also, I am in the process of getting all of my important documents in order.)"
"Growing up, me and my siblings used to hide everything that resembled a stick so that my mom won't find it and beat us with it if we did something she didn't like. 

Told my girlfriend about this. 

She told me, ""you were abused as a child"" cause no child needs to hide sticks so your mom won't you beat you with it. 

Damn.

"Grieving dad who I had a complicated relationship with

I’m new to Reddit. After my dad died a few months ago I joined some grief groups on Facebook and tried in person things but have been having a lot of trouble meeting or talking to folks who are grieving a parent they had a complicated relationship with. 

My dad was abusive my entire childhood and struggled with substance abuse as well. He spent some time in prison and so my sister and I were in foster care for until I graduated high school. We were estranged for several years after he went to prison, but started working on our relationship about 7 years ago. Since then we’d made a lot of progress and started getting really close. He was diagnosed with stage 4 distal esophageal cancer last January and died this past thanksgiving at 54 years old. 

Since then I have been feeling all kinds of things. A lot of sadness and I miss him, but also a lot of anger at him and confusion. I’ve been having a lot of flashbacks of things that happened when I was little and grieving my trauma more deeply than I ever did before. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice for dealing with this kind of grief? And if anyone has any journaling prompts specifically for grief and trauma/grieving an abuser/estranged parent, etc. I would be really grateful. I’m not religious. "
"Turned 18 in January. Have been  bombarded with threats of getting kicked out and physically harmed since i was 17, but it has dramatically increased over time. Parents have heavily withdrawn financial support and have been doing this since I was 17, but i feel the lack of financial support now more than ever. Want to move out as soon as possible. I know I have to work, but besides working, can I get some tips on how to move out as quickly and smoothly as possible ? 

2 months left of senior year and I don't wanna drop out to work but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't on my mind. I know there's a lot of ways to make money remotely/online so I'd appreciate any remote work tips, any flexible schedule/seasonal work tips, any gig work that I could pick up that would help me bring in as much money as possible. I'm more into unconventional ways of income. I'm picky about where I work, always have been regardless of the life threatening positions I've been in. I know that's not the best attitude to have in this situation but I'd be lying if I said I'm willing to work anywhere. At least I'm honest with myself about my emotional and mental capacity. I just don't see myself working a part time customer service job of any kind, but I do have some other part time job ideas that suit my mental needs. 
I am just wondering if anyone has any unconventional ways to make money besides the ways i already plan to (part time job). I already do a paid internship which gives me 20-25 hours of pay every two weeks. That is my most stable form of income right now, but even that can be a bit unstable sometimes because on a tough week I'm only given 10 or less hours in a 2 week pay period. 
Does anyone know about any emergency housing assistance/support, any emergency government programs I can apply to to get out of here as soon as possible ? The government may not consider my case an emergency since I'm technically not homeless and still have a place to stay, but I just want to know about all the resources out there. I've looked at resources already but it seems like it only applies to people in more dire situations than mine, such as people with kids and people with disabilities at risk of homelessness. Ive thought about applying for food stamps, and disability (but I don't know if my diagnoses are serious enough for disability support, plus I still want to work but I don't know if I'll be able to work and recieve disability at the same time).
I am having trouble with providing food for myself. My mom still helps with buying food but when she's upset at me I notice the amount of support drastically decrease. I do not need my livelihood to depend on someone's mood...that's how it's always been and im sick of it. My safety and my stability and my bare minimum needs have always depended on my parents mood. I shouldn't have to worry about you withdrawing the parental support i should've been guaranteed since birth as soon as you're upset at me. I shouldn't have to worry about my most important needs/wants not being met just because youre angry. That's sick. 
She also canceled my follow up psychiatry appointment today without me knowing. That was another wake up call for me. I had to change my medical account's password/contact info to prevent this in the future but she may still find a way to get into it. Especially since I'm still on her insurance, she will probably call my hospital every time I try to schedule an appointment on my own and make it extremely hard for me to receive any kind of medical support. 
Does anyone know of any medical services that would fit my situation besides the ones I've already looked into such as medicaid. Because she's threatened to kick me off her insurance in the past and this type of behavior only reinforces what she said. She has bluecross blue shield, plus 3 other types of medical insurance so if I'm kicked off her insurance it will be hard for me to find help. She is insured through her job so her kicking me off her insurance is for more of a malicious reason than a financial one. 

I don't talk to my dad even though we live in the same house, and haven't since 2021 due to a series of incidents where he put my life at risk. Ever since I've stopped talking to him, he's stopped financially supporting me. If I ever needed money from him I'd have to ask my mom to ask him, and even then the answer was rarely yes. He basically became a deadbeat after I set boundaries. And my mom has always supported his decision to stop financially supporting me cause in her words, ""You love his money but not him ? You can use him for his money but not talk to him ? He has feelings too"". 

I live in Chicago if that matters. Im wondering if there are any special programs, vouchers, housing info, online job opportunities/tips/tricks (that dont require a HS diploma obviously), any info that anyone can give me ? I'd appreciate whatever you know..thanks. I can't stay here. I don't know where I'm gonna go but I can't stay here. I could go to my grandma's house but there's barely any space for me there..and I don't want to watch the ongoing alcoholic and drug addict outbursts that frequently go on. I just want a space of my own. I need a space of my own.

"So my mom has been physically abusive for as long as I can remember, to the point where I was one of those kids who thought it wasn’t abuse. She’d never punch us granted, but she left hand prints on my face more times than I can count and once openly told me that getting whooped with the belt didn’t make me cry from the pain, but because she was the one inflicting the pain. I’ve somewhat made my peace with this, I know it’s wrong but at the same time, she’s my mom and I can’t change her, she went through it as a kid and never knew how to grow from it, so she became it. I’m not saying that makes it right, I’m just saying I don’t resent her for it any more, I’ve just accepted it. Part of the reason I accepted it was because she changed when I moved out at 16, she went from being overbearing and abusive to helpless and manipulative, and made me pity her. It kinda went from awful to just being annoying, her texting me multiple times a week asking me to drive across town to buy her cigarettes or groceries was better than her hitting me so whatever. I knew she was still hitting my sisters and I did all I could to be there for them, as well as trying to be there for my mom because her mental health actually took a decline due to an autoimmune disease that I don’t fully understand but apparently her immune system is attacking her skin cells in her legs and it’s turned into a necrotic open wound and has caused her a great deal of chronic pain. Up until recently I feel like I was doing a pretty job of being both a father figure to my sisters, teaching them to drive and deal with emotions and all that, while also being what I consider a good son to my mom and helping her through her struggles. Recently she went to the hospital where they cut out a huge chunk of the wound and packed it with a wound vac, I brought her home from the hospital and her and my middle sister immediately got into a fight. I’ve made it clear that I won’t be involved in yelling matches, they stress me out and don’t solve anything, so I left and went to pick up some groceries for my mom. When I got back mom told me that she was kicking my sister out, so I took my sister back to my house, a few blocks away from my mom’s house, and that was that. My sister is 17, so when I went to work the next day I just let her stay at my place. Apparently she decided to sneak into mom’s house to get her stuff and it got physical. My sister called the cops and the state is pressing charges against my mom. I’m trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and continue to help them both the way I have been and let them handle their own stuff, and neither is trying to make me choose sides, they both know I want to help everyone as best I can, but I feel guilty being there helping my mom after her abuse has progressed to this point. Is it wrong to still care for and worry for my mom while all this is going on? I’m at the point where I’m genuinely scared she’s going to kill herself because this is the absolute lowest I’ve ever seen her."
"Hi, both my parents were killed in a murder suicide when I was 4. I had 5 other siblings. 4 of them went to their bio father, and me and my sister went to my aunt. 

I should be thankful for being adopted into family. But I'm not. 

My childhood was hell. My aunt physically and mentally abused me and my uncle sexually molested me. My earliest memory is of him touching my penis for no reason, around age 5. I remember he was supposed to be applying a cream to my chafing in between my legs. I got curious about why he started touching my penis. My rash was in-between my legs, not on my dick. 

My aunt was (unfortunately) worse to me.she didn't sexually assault me but she physically and mentally abused me. It's hard to say that she's worse, because my uncle  sexually assaulted me my whole life, but he was the one that would try to get her to be lighter on me. She abused me for anything I did wrong. I had a learning disorder growing up, instead of taking me to get a checkup, she would hit and ground me. As a child, I remember being grounded 24/7. 

On summers, my godmother and godfather would take me until school started again. These were the best childhood memories I had. I was supposed to be grounded while at their house per my aunt's rules, but they never abused me or followed through with my aunts orders. Later on in my adulthood, my God parents told me they hated the way my aunt treated me, so that's why they'd take me for the summer. 

My uncle would molest me at nighttime when he was drinking(as he did every night). I would try everything to stop him from coming in my room at night. I would even get loud and yell ""get out"", trying to deter him from waking everyone up. Id sleep in my jeans, only to be yelled at and grounded by my aunt for sleeping in jeans. I'd figure out how to put a baseball bat between my door and water heater so that the door wouldn't open. I'd always wished someone would catch him. It never happened as a child. I understand now that my uncle was being nicer to me than my aunt because he was grooming me. 

When I turned 15, I had a growth spurt and was finally big enough to defend myself from my aunt and uncle. They both realized that, and I moved out of their house at 16. 

I was homeless for 2-3 years, I barely finished high school because I stopped going. I'd find myself sleeping on my friends and family's floors sometimes.

Anyway, I got a good job at a major dealership in town when I left. I went from being a car washer at 16 to an auto tech at 17. 

At age 24 I purchased my own home. I also invited my sister and cousin (my cousin is one I also grew up with, my aunt and uncles bio daughter) to live with me. They accepted. 

Anyway, as we were getting the house set up, I don't know how it was brought up, but my sister mentioned my cousins father and how he molested me. I was flabbergasted at how she knew? I never told anyone. When I asked her how she knew it, she said she remembered me yelling at him to get out my room at night when I was young. 

Anyway, my cousin denied it and moved out (she even stole my cat when she moved because she had one and didn't want them to be separated). Whatever. 

Anyway, I had a breakdown because I thought, if my sister heard it, then my aunt must have known it and ignored it. 

I ended up in the hospital for a suicide attempt. I eventually told my story to the on-site therapist. The therapist then told me it'd be best to tell everyone about my childhood. 

So when I got out of the hospital, I started telling family what he had done to me as a child. Then I informed my aunt, and I was surprised that she had my back. I went to confront him, he was drunk of course and denying it. When I brought up evidence he acknowledged that he didn't remember because he was drunk. 

A few days later, my uncle committed suicide. One part of my horrible childhood was finally out of my life. I never wish death upon anyone. But this was a relief. I still have dreams about him being currently alive and abusing me, those dreams terrorize me still. 

Anyway, I moved to a different state for a year to help some friends with their business. When I got back I had another breakdown and ended up in the hospital again.  So I was broke and no job, I needed a place to stay. 

I didn't have many people to ask because of their living situations, but I asked my aunt to live with her in her new house. I thought she had changed. 

Just before I asked her to move in, I was approved for ssdi, so I'd give her 40% of my ssdi check every month, which came out to around $450. She didn't ask for any money, I just started paying her every month. I didn't have much at the time and couldn't afford to give her more. 

Anyway, I've been living with her for 5 years now, at 3 years she told her daughter how she didn't want me there, her daughter has anger issues and sent me a half paragraph text telling me I'm taking advantage of her mom!? There were some ridiculous accusations, like she'd need to redo the basement bathroom because of me. So ridiculous. For some insight on that, I have IBS and spend a consideral amount of time on the toilet. So I ONLY use her basement bathroom because I don't want to stink up the upstairs bathroom. 

That text pissed me off so much. Again, instead of coming to me and asking me to move out, she sicked her anger-riled dog of a daughter on me. I don't hate her daughter, but she was the spoiled one growing up and had always gotten what she wanted growing up. She also has always had anger issues. So in my mind, she told her daughter because her daughter is overprotective. 

I was ready to just leave, but after some thought, I decided I'd take my time. She was the one who fucked me up as a child and she's the one who refuses to tell me to my face to move out. So I'd thought I'd wait until she told me to my face to leave. 

Yesterday it finally happened after 5 years of living with her. I'm ready to leave because I don't like living with her, she just always seems fake to me. I can't forget about my childhood, being raised by my aunt and uncle.  I'm still not ready to move, but I'm looking right now. I'm terrified of change, but it has to happen.  I don't know how well I'll do finding a place for $450 a month. But I will be happy to leave and never see her face again. 

I've went to my states website that helps people with disabilities find homes for cheaper. Wish me luck!

I'm open to questions that delve deeper, feel free to ask!

Sorry for the long post, but I feel much better writing this out and getting some helpful feedback!"
"I know my mother is 100% a narc. She makes everything about herself, loves to portray herself as a ""victim"", projects her insecurities on me, doesn't have a shred of empathy or sympathy but expects those things from others, and lastly she's so full of herself and views herself as the most beautiful and perfect woman in the world.

But what about my dad? He has a huge inflated ego and thinks very highly of himself. He's also dismissive of my feelings and health issues and blames me for getting sick like my mother. Both of them expects sympathy, compassion, importance and attention from me but they are always ignorant or dismissive when it comes to my pain and feelings. They yell at me for not always helping them in household chores and always says that how lazy I am for always not coming to their help, but when I do, they behave rudely with me and snaps at me. 

My mother says, ""You've done enough, go away"". My father makes faces and gets irritated and says, ""I can manage"", in a curt tone. They accuse me of being a lazy and an ungrateful brat to their friends. I just can't figure out what to do and what they want from me. "
"So my parents never really believed in doctors and especially not in mental health issues, but since becoming an adult and taking my healthcare into my own hands I’ve been diagnosed with multiple things, both mental and physical. The majority I haven’t told my mom because I just don’t feel like dealing with it, but when I do tell her things (usually because I’m worried my younger sisters who are still in her care have the same issues and Im trying to get her to get them treatment or at the very least assessed for it) she then has me list of “why I have it” as if I have to prove to her I have it. She then goes off about how she deals with all of the same things which leads to her either expecting me to console her or her lecturing me about how she’s lived her whole life with it so I’m just being a baby and need to get over it. I don’t want to just tell her she doesn’t have it, even when it’s very obvious she doesn’t, because I’m not a medical professional and I know she’ll use it against me, but I can’t come up with a way to divert the conversation away from that and show that my symptoms or what im dealing with is different. It just feels like im talking to an incredibly self-centered wall. She also has other responses as well like saying I’m just trying to upset her or put more on her plate by “claiming” I have these health issues, but I don’t have as much of an issue coming up with responses to these as I do when she claims she’s inflicted with the same thing. Any help with how to deal or respond to this would be helpful. "
"This is a repost from my old account. 

I'm sorry it's a long post, but I just needed to write it out. 

I 28f have been in therapy for 25 years. Growing up I had this horrible rage I didn't really understand. Tbh I was a horrible sibling to my sisters and my bio mom. As an adult I now understand why I was the way I was. Over my life Ive been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, BIPOLAR 1 AND BIPOLAR 2, DEPRESSION, SEASONAL DEPRESSION, GENERAL ANXIETY, PTSD AND CPTSD. not to mention I was diagnosed with BPD when the man who I call my father passed away when I was 16. 
My sperm donner raped and molested me as an baby and toddler. I haven't seen him since I was 4 but Jennifer (bio mom) knew something had happened and put my in therapy. The thing is she never told anyone in my family. My sisters grew up thinking I was some awful person when I was just a child whos body and emotions were constantly reacting to my trauma. 
When my memories came back 5 years ago I told Jennifer and her response was ""that's not true!""  ""You're lying!"" ""That never happened!""
Even though when memories of my molestation from my babysitter also came back 4 years prior to the rape memories Jennifer told me that's why she put me in therapy. She knew something had happened.
I grew up crying myself to sleep every night because Jennifer taught me it wasn't safe to cry elsewhere. If I cried around her she would tell me ""stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about"". 

I grew up being the villain in the family. I take responsibility for how I was and who I was (I'm not that way anymore) but my family will always see me that way.

Growing up Jennifer refused to acknowledge that I would be acting out because of my trauma (that no one but her knew about) and I grew up learning I was a burden and my emotional needs were NEVER met by her. Granted she would always fight to make sure I had medicine and therapy, but that was all she did for me. I grew up TERRIFIED to tell her I was sorry for something because she would say "" you should be sorry!"" And then tell me exactly how I messed up and throw it in my face. I grew up being so scared of her. I would try to hide my mistakes so I would t be berated. When she finally told me and my sister's about why she and my bio dad (Tom) got divorced it was because he went to jail for child pornography and having am affair with our 16 year old babysitter. (The same one who molested me). My sisters and I learned Tom would constantly beat and SA Jennifer as well. She never dealt with that trauma. So there were so many times growing up that she would tell me ""you're just like Thomas"" when my illnesses would flair up. (My sisters only got depression from Tom and Jennifer. I got literally any and every mental illness and physical illness that could have been passed down) so I grew up believing I was as bad as a rapist and someone who beat people. I mean granted I already hated myself, but that didn't help. I grew up being forced to go to the Mormon cult and I never felt comfortable being there, but I grew to realize that if I wanted to feel like I ""fit in"" in my family I needed to conform to the church's ideas and standards. Hell I would wear vneck tshirts at a family gathering and I would be told to ""cover up"" around my BILs. (Um.... that's fucking gross that my sisters wanted me to cover what little cleavage I was wearing around my BROTHERS!!)

The man I call my Dad (David) he came into my life when I was 7. He was the man who taught me to trust men again. It took over 3 years to actually trust that I wouldn't be hurt, but David become my whole world. He was my best friend and my protector. He knew how much I was ganged up on from my sisters and Jennifer and he would ALWAYS go to bat for me. Even when I had messed up, he was in my corner. Not to say he wouldn't discipline me, but he would do it with love and not by making me scared (like Jennifer would). He was he first person in my life, that chose to see me for who i was and love me unconditionally. He had children from a previous marriage and when they turned 18 he would help them, but tell them their an adult and to go live as an adult(basically kicked them out), but he had told Jennifer that I would probably have to live with them after I turned 18 and that that was okay. When he died I lost it and the trauma was so huge for me I was diagnosed with BPD. Less than a year after his death Jennifer sent me to a ""school""  in the mountains. I had become too much for her to want to deal with. I admit my only emotions in the household were to either be dissociated or anger flare up from my PTSD and BPD. But she chose to send me away to friends houses all the time and then eventually sent me away. I didn't know I was going until 30 minutes before I arrived there. I was told I was going on a road trip. The school she dropped me off at was so horrible that just this year after a decade of leaving, I'm able to truly open up to my therapist and be vulnerable about what happened.

I've worked my ass off to be able to be who I am now and where I am. However my family only ever continued to see me as who I was. Jennifer is a covert narcissist due to her trauma and she would always make me the villain and her the victim.
I knew if I wanted to continue to be in this family I would need Jennifer and I to go to mother daughter therapy. There were things that we needed to heal from but she still didn't know how to communicate with me in a healthy manner. So when I asked of she would be willing to go to therapy to be willing to learn to communicate in a healthy manner with me I got told that I was the problem and I'm the one who doesn't know how to communicate.

After my final straw happened I went no contact with her. My partner heard the way she spoke to me and berated me and he was floored. After crying in his arms, I knew I needed to get away.

My step dad and Jennifer had been made aware that if Jennifer continued to talk to me the way she does and treats me that way I would be forced to go no contact) I knew going no contact would mean I would lose my entire family. The most heartbreaking was that I lost my nieces and nephews. Tbh I stayed longer in that family than I wanted to, because I didn't want to lose my nieces and nephews. 


But even now sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles and cousins dont know what Tom did to me as a child. Jennifer refused to ever tell them and now the will never know. They will always think of me as the villain and never understand why I was the way I was.

What sucks is Jennifer and Steve told everyone I cut off contact because she ""physically abused me"" growing up. But that's not true. I made it VERY clear as to why I was going NC. Hell I even have the screenshots to prove that I told them it was because of mental and emotional abuse. 

I realize I was difficult for her to handle growing up. I take accountability for who I used to be. Especially because I am no longer that person. But she refused to ever take accountability for the damage she caused me. 

I don't regret going no contact. My mental health is still struggling as I heal all the traumas in my life, but at the same time I feel like a giant burden has been lifted"
Im alright nothing bad happened when I went to lunch with my Pop Pop! My stuff is safe!
Pop Pop always wants me dressed up and have my hair combed even if where not going somewhere fancy.
"I had to move back home due to a breakdown.

My father became very cold during this period.

Now I'm over it, in trying to build our relationship back up. However, I practically had to beg for him to even talk to me.

He is now, but our relationship is sort of an ultimatum. Unless I talk to him first, he won't talk to me. Unless I sort of pander to him, he won't talk.

He has disrespectful presence around me. He zaps all my power and I have none.

Before we both had a healthy relationship. Both of us were powerful. But now it's like he holds complete power over me.

It affects my thinking, my decision making and my mental health and self esteem. 

What do I do? I'm moving back out in a month, but my mental health will remain the same.

"When I was a kid, maybe like 5ish years old, my dad was the cool, fun etc kind of parent. The corporal punishment (pretty common where we live) started around this age and from there everything started going downhill. For the first few years it was pretty normal but when i was 9/10 he started having really random spells of anger where it felt like all his sympathy just switched off and he’d just go crazy and take it all out on me. But then the anger spell would be over and a few hours later it would be like everything was normal again. He’d go up to months without anything happening and then one day he would just snap. 

When I was 11 covid came and essentially screwed up my life. All the 3-4 month periods of lockdown just made my life a living hell. He’d refuse to give me food, lock me up, force me to kneel in the corner of his study for hours on end just so I wouldnt ‘disturb him’ and the anger spells got a lot more frequent. 
It was kind of up and down from then on where thered be periods where nothing would really happen and periods where day after day he was beating me up (excusing it as punishment) with belts canes and that sort of thing. There was this particular incident when i was 13 where i walked in on him drinking and his breath smelled of alcohol and the first thing he did was invite me to join him. Five seconds later he was in some wild drunken rage throwing the bottle at me and slamming me against the wall, cutting my back with the glass and pouring the fucking alcohol over the open wounds. But there were also times where it felt like everything was fine. 

Now its sort of in this constant up and down where it feels like there are two entirely different sides of him. He doesn’t even need me to piss him off or something somedays he just barges into my room and fucking glares at me until i follow him to the study because he fucking knows im too afraid of him to do anything else and it just feels like he can be so horribly sadistic and disgusting at times but others hes so supportive of me. 

And im just praying that whatever is going on in his head is something that can be fixed or changed in some way because i just want the old him back. And its so hard to hate the abusive side of him because hes also attached to someone i love more than anyone in the world and someone who has been there from me and im just so lost."
"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out because I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to handle my current situation at home. I'm about to turn 16 tomorrow, but instead of feeling excited, I find myself dreading it because of the turmoil in my household.

To give you some context, my mother and stepfather have been arguing almost every day, and it's not just simple disagreements—it often spirals into verbal and even physical abuse. My stepfather has been violent towards me, my younger siblings, and my mother, which has left all of us feeling frightened and unsafe in our own home. It's heartbreaking to witness and even worse to experience firsthand.

What's truly distressing is the way my mom handles these situations. She tends to bring up past grievances and hurts during their fights, using them as weapons against each other. She also downplays my stepfather's behavior and expects me to forgive him easily because she believes she had a tougher childhood than I do. It's like she's invalidating our pain and trauma, and it's incredibly hurtful.

But it doesn't end there. When my mom is angry, she tends to take it out on me and my siblings, cursing and degrading us in the heat of the moment. It's emotionally draining and demoralizing, especially when I try to assert myself and speak up for what's right, only to be dismissed as immature and told to ""grow up even more."" It's a constant cycle of blame and invalidation that leaves me feeling lost and trapped.

To make matters worse, my parents have been married for almost eight years now, and their constant fighting is taking a toll on all of us. The tension in our home is palpable, and it's affecting our mental and emotional well-being. Today, my mom even told me she won't be able to celebrate my birthday because of our disagreements, which just adds to the sense of hopelessness and despair.

I'm reaching out to seek advice on how to navigate this incredibly challenging situation. I feel like I'm at a loss and don't know where to turn. Any guidance or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to listen."
"I’m positive screwed, I called someone who saw abuse but didn’t stop it. I have to meet up with my Pop Pop today for lunch and soon as he hears what I did…

Background:
I was camping and I wanted to walk around at night and see what the campground looked like at night in different places. But she didn’t let me I knew that campground though and I know how to be careful.

My “nice” aunt was there and she did hold my arms behind me and my ex aunt was there too! I remember what happened and what she called me “a stupid spoiled little brat!” 

After years of having to hide this yesterday I called her out and told her I just want an apology, just once. She denied it and said it never happened. Unlike before this was a good thing."
"I just had the worst day in a long time which is crazy because yesterday I fainted during public speaking. 

My mom bought me these Starbucks coffee cans a few days ago, but she’s one of those people on tik tok that always listen to the videos they hear. Well she’s convinced that it is an energy drink, and maybe it is, but today when I started drinking it infront of her she starts telling me how bad that is for me. I respectfully say but it’s just Starbucks and she still was giving me a lecture on how it’s not healthy. I decided to walk away, which she did not appreciate and started talking to my aunt about how I need to get mad and unmad. This is where I made a mistake, I got irritated because I wasn’t mad at her, I had walked away to protect my peace. Anyways I try to tell her no I’m not mad I just get frustrated when you tell me how everything I do is wrong (she constantly makes comments about the stuff I do, last time she said I had frontal lobe damadge for vaping and shamed me). Realistically all I wanted was to make her understand why I walked away but she started yelling at me and cutting me off. I go into her room, she’s yelling at me to get out and I just wanted to finish my point. Well she starts screaming so bad and I freeze and she comes at me and physically pushed me out of her room and slammed the door on me. I got very angry and hurt and I started crying, and screamed I hate you you are a narcissist. That is where I know I messed up as that’s pretty rude, but she litterally is more concerned that I called her a narcissist over me hating her. 

Now she is so worried that my aunt is going to talk shit and call her abusive as she has witnessed this whole thing and now she’s shit talking me to my dad saying it’s my fault they are going to think this of her. I try so hard to talk to her but she keeps twisting the story and I’m starting to feel crazy. 

I just want to know if I am in the wrong so I’m being as transparent as possible. "
"My (29m) mom (really a stepmom but she's been in my life since I was 2 so she's always been ""mom"") severely abused me as far back as I can remember. It was just  much about being hit as it was being psychologically messed with. 

Some of the earlier memories were of being sent to my room and I would have to remove my clothing and be told not to get into the clothes or I'd get whooped. I would sit on my top bunk feeling real strange, exposed, confused. But it was often enough that I knew it to be normal. I was given smacks on my private area a few times that I remember. 

When I got older, went through puberty, and got much bigger than her, she seemed to really make a point of letting me know I'm not in charge and that I won't shame her by being an animal. So, anytime I was being yelled at I had to get on my knees and pull my pants down. She would say it was a reality check. . 

She had a focus on me not being an animal and called my penis my tail. If I was being talked to or spanked and it moved to much she'd chastise me for wagging it. 

Spankings were front and back. Nothing off limits and I was not to hide or pull away or worse would be threatened. She had a way of really making me believe she needed to do what she was doing and it was normal. 

I would be forced to kneel outward either in my room, her room, or the back deck with no pants or underwear. It would last forever it felt like and I was not to move. 

This is part of the really disgusting and messed up part. When I was like that, I was told she would force my obedience no matter what. I was not to move an inch or flinch. She would let her dogs come sniff me and lick me and tell me that if I was cleaner it wouldn't happen. This isn't true. I tried. I would be stuck there and she would pretend not to notice but sure did as soon as I moved. 

She eventually got real open with this level of humiliation and knew I would never share what happened as I was deeply shamed. She would openly talk about me getting my tail licked and insinuated it would come out if I stepped over the line. 

This is such a small amount of the details. I'm just starting to open up.

"  I am 18, turning 19 in May. 
  I escaped my abusive household back in July. I went away to work in a different city ( so i could be apart from them) for 2 months and when it was over i moved out immediately and got my own place in September in my hometown. I have been working since i was 16, started back in july 2021 so I saved up money to do so. 
  The first two weeks were really hard and i was mourning the family i never had, the one i was supposed to have. I cried a lot because i knew i deserved a lot better and i didn’t get treated like i was supposed to. 
  I kinda put all my energy into working, picking up all the extra shifts i was allowed so I didn’t have to be alone and that way I didn’t have much time to feel sorry for myself. 
  Christmas was a really difficult time since the place i work at was closed for 3 days and even my two flatmates went home to their families to celebrate. Holidays are so difficult to spend alone, and now that Easter is coming up those feelings are coming out again and i just feel so lonely. Obviously it is still much better than having to be at “home” and i am so grateful that i can be apart from them but it’s still very difficult. 
  I picked up extra shifts for Easter too, but since i cant work 7/7 days a week i have to be home too by myself. 

  My question to you guys who have went through this too would be how you cope with this feeling? That you are supposed to be together with your “loved” ones but aren’t. Does it get better with time? It would be easier if i had a partner but sadly i don’t so spending it with them isn’t an option either. 

  I struggle a lot with my image of a family. I crave the feeling of being close to them but the idea of a mother and motherly love disgusts me and i couldn’t stand being loved by one. At this point i just wish i could go back in time and “put with another family” at birth so i would have a whole different image. I want to have a mother figure but at the same time it would make me feel so disgusted i just can’t. 

I wish everyone in the same position as me all the love and luck because you all deserve it and to those still at home trying to escape all the strength. It is a very difficult thing to do but being lonely alone is still better than being there. 

Have a Happy Easter you all🫶💐"
"My mother and I always fight. The past five or six times she’s pushed me beyond my breaking point to the end that I’ve always self-inflicted (hitting myself in the head because I didn’t want to hit her, getting so infuriated I would bite myself on the arm). This last time, a couple days ago when I went to get my self-inflicted bite looked at (it was fine by the way), the doc at the ER told me I needed to quit self-inflicting and redirect in some other way. 

Well today about ten minutes ago, instead of self-inflicting or redirecting…I just went for it. I charged her. Apparently I hurt my ankle in the process, I must have stepped wrong 😅 what, I was far too infuriated at her to pay attention to my footing 🤷🏻‍♂️ Anyway, I went to punch her in the head but she put her arm up to defend herself, so I grabbed it by the wrist and yanked it downward so I’d have a free shot. I stopped short though and faked her out a couple times threatening to hit her. All the while I was gripping the zhit out of her wrist as I held it out of the way - I’ve got vice grip hands, my grip strength is stronger than most people’s. She was on the verge of tears so I decided to let her go and so I faked to punch her a couple more times just to make sure she got the message. I was still blocking her way out of the room so then she said “are you gonna let me go, or are you gonna go?” And so I stepped aside and like shooing a stray dog I snappedly pointed for her to “go on, GET!” 👉 

So I’m icing my sore foot/ankle right now, when that’s done I’m gonna go to one of those minor emergency places to make sure I didn’t tear any ligaments or anything. But I finally stood up to the old fat cow, I didn’t self-inflict, I just went for it. I feel proud myself. God it felt good. Felt powerful. Finally to be able to have control back 😊"
"Some backstory I live with my mom who divorced my dad for being abusive, I have always hated him for it but my mom always forced me and my sister to spend weeks/months with her as he was abusive and she just wanted him to buy stuff for us. He is really religious and extremly sexist so he has always treated me better than my sister. Recently he found out my sister smokes and takes nicotine which he asked me about and I told him the truth. I regret it . I fear that he will ask her about and it will be big mess. He has almost hit my sister but I pushed him down. I hate my dad and his new family. He has to always makes comment how I look and tell me I am ugly how i am . I just want to tell my sister , I hope she doesn't get mad. I will update. But i will just not visit my dad anymore. The reason why this happened is because my dad is too lazy to text and I told him I only wanted to text him for contact as I can get the word properly without feeling bad or feeling my words not coming out. I just can express myself better over text as I don't feel physcialy pressured or the fear they will scream over me. Please someone give me feedback.

Update: my sister is okay and she knew something fishy was happening, we figured out he was going through her stuff and we both are now not going to have any contact with him for a while."
"So I am pretty sure my best friend is being verbally and/or emotionally abused by her mom and step dad. I really don't know how to help her but I was hoping I could get some advice from yall. 

Yesterday, I was on call with my friend and her mom came into her room. They were laughing and messing with each other which they do often. and for some random reason, her mom puts her feet in my friends face. My friend then jokingly said ""I don't like the kid"" which her mom is currently pregnant. My friends mom proceeds to yell at her and leave the room. I only heard half the conversation because she hung up. 

Both me and my friend proceeded to message each other about the situation. This is our conversation:

&#x200B;

Me: U okay???

Friend: No...I'm really not

Me: I'm sorry

Me: I hate when my parents yell at me

Friend: She was literally putting her feet in my face

Me: And got mad at you when you told her to stop?

Friend: No I said jokingly I don't like the kid, and she got mad

Friend: And apparently she crying.

Friend: I just got yelled at

Friend: I understand that was messed up but I didn't mean to say it it just came out

Friend: And now I'm the villain

Me: Sometimes people take things personally. So you might wanna be a lil more careful about stuff like that. I would explain to her on text, it's a lil easier to explain and be heard instead of being interrupted

Friend: I didn't mean to say it tho. It just came out

Friend: And I said sry

Friend: And I don't even know who I've been having an attitude lately

Me: Ik, tell her that on text. With my experience with \*Name\*, the best way to be heard is to tell them all at once. Which can be done on text

Me: Even if you told her already, tell her again. And not in multiple messages either. But in one big message

Friend: Ik she'll just get more mad

Me: Well that's her problem

Friend: But it will somehow become mine. 

Friend: I just don't know what to do anymore

Friend: I try so HARD to be perfect... The right kid my mom wants

Friend: But I can't

Me: That isn't okay. No one is perfect. I'm not, your not, no one. She gotta understand that peeps make mistakes

Me: can you try asking her if you two can have a conversation without raising your voices and staying calm?

Friend: No. I don't want to..I feel I might get yelled at again.. and I can't. Bc I will call my dad. And I will ask to stay with him. He doesn't care if I'm perfect. He wants me to be me.

Friend: I'm scared to even walk out of my room

Friend: I shouldn't have to feel that way

Me: Your right. Sometimes people are like this and you just have to deal with it. The best thing to know is that you are you, only you can choose how you act, or how you look. If someone has an opinion about you and you fell it is wrong, it is. 

Friend: I just.. I just hate it

Me: I know, I do too

Friend: \*Name\* calls me a pig at times. He says he's just joking but it doesn't seem like he's joking.

Friend: And then my mom yells at me like everyday

Me: I think you should tell your dad about this. I'm not really sure what I can do for you that will actually change anything. But your dad has more power than me and maybe he can help you. You can still talk about it to me and I can give you support, but I think the only way to actually stop is is to talk to him

Friend: No..no you don't understand. They r going to court rn. If I tell him he'll use that evidence against her and she'll know I told him. I'll just get yelled at even more! He isn't trying to hurt me. He wouldn't! But.. she doesn't know that I know.

Friend: I wish I could tell him..but I'm scared

Me: I think telling him is your only option. Your gonna have to deal with the consequences. I wish I could help you, I really do, but I don't know how other than this. 

Friend: But I don't wanna deal with them

Friend: I'm scared

Me: I'm scared too. For you. And this may be the only way to help.

Friend: I might call you soon

Me: Maybe in a bit. I'm kinda emotional rn

Friend: Why, bc of me?

Me: No, because of your situation

Friend: I just need to talk to someone in real life

Friend: like on a call

Me: We can call then. I think I'm chill enough rn

Friend: kk

Friend: Am I just a bad person? A bad daughter?

Me: NO

Me: NEVER

Me: Don't think that way

Me: You are awesome

Me: Just how you are

Me: Don't let you or anyone make you feel that way

Me: Being yourself isn't a crime

Friend: Thank you \*Name\*. For always being there for me. For always helping me out. For making me feel special. For making me feel like I belong.

Me: I am always gonna be there for you. I mean, you have been my friend for as long as I can remember, how could I not?

Me: Don't be afraid to talk to me about anything, good or bad

Friend: I won't

Friend: I promise

Friend: you fish

Me: Nah, I think I'm more of a fish stick <3

&#x200B;

I am very worried for her. I have had lots of suicidal situations in my life, a few years ago I was constantly having suicidal thoughts and recently my uncle has cut his wrists. I really don't want her to feel like that. I understand what it is like to have abusive parents. My dad and stepmom are not the best. I have also had experience with her mom, we used to live together as roommates and her mom would constantly be a jerk to me. My mom would often take me and my friend places to avoid staying home alone with her mom. I am also planning on telling my friend's dad if she doesn't tell her herself but at the same time I don't want to get involved. Any suggestions? Btw, the fish and fish stick thing is just am inside joke of ours."
"This is my first time posting here, so, please let me know if this is the right place or not to be posting this.

Recently I (19f) have started noticing that the way I'm being treated by my mother, as well as how I have been treated in the past could qualify as sexual abuse. But since I've tried to bury my experiences (that are still currently going on) as a way to cope with it, I don't know if this really is sexual abuse or not. 

I also want to clarify that I do know that my mother is physically, emotionaly and mentally abusive but I just need to know if this is sexual abuse as well. 

For some context my mother is extremely violent and would randomly lash out at me for no reason. She does this by either physically attacking me or hurling verbal abuses at me. But now I'm noticing that whenever she attacks me she only kicks me at my vagina. She'll look at it and then she'll just kick me right there with full force. 

I know that she's aiming for my vagina because she keeps on trying to repeatedly hit me there. Also she just randomly attacks me there without any sort of provocation. And if I bring up how that's extremely inappropriate and try to communicate my feelings she tells me that I have a dirty mind for thinking that way about her. 

She makes jokes about random people exploring me sexually. For example: one time my neighbour was having a bunch of construction workers building his house and I told my mom how I wished that this would be over soon. I said that because I always listen to music while showering and the sound of construction prevents absolutely anything else from being audible. When I explained this to her she started saying that I have no reason to complain and am I saying that because I want one of the workers to join me in the shower. 

She's always touching me innapropreatly. One day, when I was 10-11 I was getting dressed in the bathroom after my shower when she just started banging on the door. She threatened to break the door if I didn't open it so I slightly open it and ask her what does she want. This was when she just forcefully opened the door and barged. Mind you I was completely naked, down to my butt. When I tried to tell her to leave and cover myself she told me to stop overreacting because she's my mom and according to her that means that she can see me naked. She did this just to come inside and measure my waist. 

She accused me of having sex, sending nudes, being a prostitute, masturbating and all sorts of sexual activities that she imagined I could be doing. She's beeinga causing me of this for as long as I can remember. Like one time I was 8 and I overheard her telling my siblings that she doesn't feel safe in leaving me alone at home because I might being doing something innapropreate and nasty. She also says that she worries that I'll grow up to become a sex worker. 

Finally she's always deliberately exposing herself to me and she says that it's fine because she's my mother. Like she'll use the bathroom and leave the whole door open or she'll just walk out naked in front of me and complain if I look away because according to her it's okay if I see her naked as I'm just her daughter. 

On multiple occasions I've told her just how uncomfortable all of this makes me feel but she never takes it seriously and actively ignores it. 

Is this sexual abuse?

"I’m really in a dilemma, both my parents have drinking problem and my dad have been drinking ever since I could remember, we faced a lot of problems cause of his alcoholism but now that he’s older his abuse have toned down. The problem is my mom have started to drink and she’s ruining the family environment, it was another thing if she was drinking and just having a good time but whenever she drink she randomly choose a hill to die on and just make everyone’s life miserable. I want to tell my dad about since my dad haven’t suspect a thing and I just wanna be done it. I just want to them get divorced or something and if I tell my dad about her drinking they probably will separate as all her behaviours will be explained. Should I tell my dad that my mom been drinking that is why every night it’s war for us all? "
"I'm glad he said it. At least we don't have to pretend now. 

I've never posted anything about my dad before. 90% of the memories I (20F) have of my dad are bad ones. He is verbally and physical abusive, fake, and has tried his best to make his wife and kids dependent on him. He has somewhat succeeded at the last one. 

Yesterday my dad and I had a disagreement and he started yelling. All I had to do was ask ""why are you yelling?"" And he lost his shit bc apparently I had disrespected him. And then I lost my shit. I was so tired of it. I normally just ignore his yelling because I don't like to stoop down to his level. I didn't yell back at him, but I was saying things like ""do you think you yelling is helping at all right now?"" And he was blaming my mom for everything. He wasn't even talking straight to me. He never has. 

This morning, I woke up to him and my mom yelling after he came back from his night shift. He blames her for not disciplining me. 

For a good amount of time, a few years actually, I thought him acting this way was somehow my fault. That I did something wrong to hurt him. I thought I was at fault for not turning out like he wanted. I'm out of that now. I know that no matter how I turned out, he would never be happy because in every possibility, I see myself standing up to his abuse. And he can't stand it. 

I have to live with him for some more time unfortunately but at least now I know how he actually feels. I'm the type of person to never be in debt. As soon as I started earning money, I took responsibility of my own expenses and even helped out in groceries. I don't give a shit anymore.  I'm going to use his money. He gave me his card as a nice gesture because he couldn't give me his time or love. He always talks about how he's gotten me everything I've ever wanted, which is not true, but if that's what he's claiming, so be it. I'm saving my money for when I actually need it. I've always respected his time and space because he works night shifts (by choice), but he's never done the same for me so I don't really care anymore. I'm gonna do what I want.

I'm only gonna deal with him because of my siblings and mom. I love them and I love my friends. My dad can fall off a cliff for all I care.

"Hello, I'm just here to vent more about my situation with my Nigerian Parents (with me being a 17M). I did a previous post in r/narcissisticparents regarding this, but something happened again. Recently, they found out about my grades being poor. To them, my grades being poor is because of me playing Men's Volleyball (to which they both hate as a sport). As a result, they then proceeded to yell at me about how I'm not serious, throw objects at me, and search my tabs (to which they found me watching YouTube videos instead of doing work despite it being Friday). They proceeded to tell me how Volleyball is a useless sport and how I won't get paired in it, but if I wanted to pursue a career in basketball, it would be fine due to the money (despite me knowing well that I wouldn't even make it to the league). They also said that if I don't pass in college that they'll either disown me, ""get a hatchet and cut me to pieces for the world to see"", threatened to ""smash my Chromebook on my head if I ever try to play volleyball again"" and other cruel stuff too.

What's funny too is that when they were searching my tabs, they first found the youtube video (it was an SCP foundation one), and the next two tabs were volleyball related shows that I was watching (those shows being Haikyuu and Spike Team). The Haikyuu and Spike Team tabs weren't loading, but they skipped the Haikyuu one, then waited for the Spike Team one to load (despite them not doing the same for the haikyuu one), and then afterwards they proceeded to yell at me more, and thrown my objects (my father throwing a pen and nearly throwing a shoe. Although I was able to get back into my room and lock it again). Afterwards, they proceeded to say how I wasn't serious, how I had to pass, and how if I don't pass, then I'd be a disgrace.

After this, they proceeded to go through colleges, with my mother trying to make me do something ""easier"" like Biology, Chemistry, or BioChemistry, but my father wasn't having it, saying how ""Ill learn the same things from Pharmacy or PreMedicine if I do Biochemistry"" and ""I'd be a bum in the streets if I do Biology or Chemistry instead of Pharmacy or PreMedicine"". Then once again threatening me with violence if I fail college, despite me being in my Senior Year of HighSchool. Then after all this, they then proceeded to schedule me to do a tour to MCPHS (one of the schools that my parents forced me to apply too) during spring break, saying how it's ""his school"" (despite my mother asking me what school I want to go to, but I didn't even choose since I knew that my father and her wouldn't like any of my options and would try to ""shift"" me into theirs).

At this rate, I wasn't even as scared as I was last time, just more annoyed if anything. I have to put up with their pressure and how they want doctors and such. I still feel trapped like last time and I feel like no matter what I do, I'm basically forced in one direction in life by some sort of god or something (that being ""medicine"", despite me, my counselor, and my Health and Wellness teacher knowing very well that I don't like medicine). I didn't even try the suggestion my Counselor made about having my parents come to her and talk about my college choices since I knew this would make my situation worst. I even made a promise to my coach that I'd be playing this year again last year inorder to have college coaches come and watch me play to be recruited, but I guess that's never happening. I don't really know what to do at the rate my life is going tbh, and its like I'm expecting to get better, but at the same time, I knew damn well that it's never going to.

I also made another post regarding this couple of months ago, ill link it below here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/17ipzxu/my\_parents\_made\_me\_feel\_stuck\_and\_i\_have\_no\_clue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/17ipzxu/my_parents_made_me_feel_stuck_and_i_have_no_clue/)

Edit: Also, my father talked to me about it, which was basically a lot of nothing where he was saying how he hates failure (figures), and how I wasn't speaking up (despite me knowing that's a clear trap for anything nonmedicine/school wise), how I could've asked for help on anything (despite me knowing that's a lie, that ""help"" will only apply for medicine"", and that I probably would've had to deal with more abuse if I did told him my problems), saying how they sent me to private school for better opportunities (despite me knowing that I'm only in private school because I ""snitched"" on them on my Elementary school counselor for the public school I was at about their abuse, and they only moved me to private school inorder for them to avoid CPS. I still have them occasionally ask if I told anyone about what their doing to this day after school), and other useless tidbits too. My father also wants me to stop watching animated shows and watch live action shows/sports (despite me watching Men's Volleyball games, people like Erik Shoji reviewing professional games, and watching the Out of System Volleyball Podcast, but knowing my parents, watching any IRL volleyball content ""doesn't count"") because he thinks that watching animated shows will slow my mental capacities and such. Calling it ""shit"" and ""useless"". In all honesty, I have no clue what to do."
"me f16, my mother f46, and my little brother m9 have been subjects to my fathers (m47) verbal, emotional and physical abuse since i can remember, he is a very argumentative and abusive alcoholic who starts arguments and lectures over the smallest things. he constantly verbally abuses us and hits us just in the right places where no one would see and i'm reaching my breaking point. we have tried to leave him before but my mother was not financially stable enough to support us and we had to go back to him, due to us being from eastern europe, toxic and abusive relationships and partners are common to my mother and we just have been enduring his abuse ever since. i want to emphasise my mother is the strongest and kindest person i have ever met, she always protected me when i was young and would bare his punches and slaps for me, now we both do everything we can to shield my little brother from him. i don't have much proof of the abuse if that's needed for a case against him im not sure, but i have countless stories of his threats to take our lives, to do horrible things to my mother infront of us and many other horrifying things. we currently live in the uk and i want to take the initiative to finally be rid of him but i don't know how, i have spoken about this with my friends who have been through similar situations and they say the police won't do much to help, is this true? i just really cannot live like this anymore, any advice or help is appreciated"
"When I (30F) was 6 years old, my then 13 year old half brother began abusing me. The abuse occured daily/nightly, breaking into the bathroom to harm me in the shower, in my own bed, and luring me into his bedroom. 
There was a specific incident when I was 12 that he attacked me in the shower, this resulted in a panic attack and me naked on the bedroom floor, my father walked in on me panicking and watched my brother exit the bathroom and asked no questions. (My parents are both alcoholics and would often leave us alone to go drink).

When I was finally 15 I was berated into telling my mother why I was harming myself, which resulted in her throwing a self-pity party and no therapy for anyone. Nothing was ever done.
Eventually I was told I would be moving states away to live with my grandmother and everything was swept under the rug.

My mother continues to financially and emotionally support my rapist brother, no jail time, no record, no therapy. He has been protected from facing any reality or consequences of his actions.

I just don't understand how a parent could blatantly choose one child over another, especially the offender. 

I feel like I'm going crazy all these years later, and as much as I try to keep my mother and brother out of my life, they are in the same small town as I am."
"I’m actually looking to take my trauma further by actually getting compensation for it.

"ok. I'm 23f currently desperately trying to graduate from my last year of college. my dad (bipolar, fucking megalomaniac, refusing treatment) just entered another manic episode and is trying to force me to like, distribute antisemitic propaganda for him. I will be verbally abused if I don't play along with whatever the fuck he wants and he's already yelling at me for hours every day despite my attempts to keep the peace. I'm too drained from this behaviour to work on any assignments anymore. he's also ruining my entire family's finances right now since he won't get a job and spends all my mom's money on random bullshit.

what the fuck can I do? this man has spent my entire life eroding my ability to stand up for myself. I just want to graduate so I can get a full time job and run for the hills :( "

"Okay... so I am not sure if I should post it here, or somewhere else tbh, but I am asking for some guidance.  
It was my 30th birthday a few days ago, and my parents got me a new freezer and fridge (much needed my last one was so tiny and could barely fit anything) -- I was of course grateful, told them that like ten times that day, called my dad and told him I was grateful, called my grandma (who apparently helped buy them) and told her I was grateful.

  
Then for some reason, my mom starts lecturing me that I should learn to be more thankful, more grateful, and just randomly be like ""Oh boy I love my new freezer, I'm so happy!"" -- and do that, forever. Like until they die? I have no idea.

  
I just know that every time they do something kind for me, I am told that I am not grateful, or thankful enough, despite the fact that I do say thank you, and show my gratitude.

  
I am genuinely confused as to what I did wrong for that to happen? Like a part of my literally thinks they want me to kiss the ground they walk on forever, for some reason. They don't even treat my brother this way at all. It's just me, not being grateful, not being thankful, being selfish, being mean, I literally feel like a trashcan or a punching bag every time it happens and I am so tired and sick of it.

  
(I do go to therapy, and I am defintely going to talk with her about it all, but I also just need some strangers to tell me whether I am being an asshole or if there truly is something weird going on here.)"
I 14 year old female recently bothered my mother I did not get as early as she wanted because I was upset from last night. I guess I fell back a sleep so she was pissed. She was being passive aggressive and ignored me I don't mind but I'm afraid she will hurt me. My father is mad at me always has been and he encourages her to be harsher. Maybe it's normal but I don't want to see her. I feel like she will do more than slapping and hairpulling this time. I'm don't want to see them I just want to disappear I hate this.
"Sorry in advance I had to add alot of extra information for context, I'm sorry this is so long, I'm just looking for help.

I (16F) cut my dad off in August the day before school after he had a huge explosive episode where he texted me telling me to just stay with my mom from now on ( I saw him on the weekends). For years my dad complained I never saw him enough and this summer I was seeing him the most I ever had in my life , 5 days a week, thinking it would help our relationship. He became the most emotionally abusive he had ever been with me and would even get mad at me for asking to stop and buy medicine when sick because it put him at an inconvenience where he would yell at me calling me insensitive and selfish. Things like that.
For more context. 
My father is 46 and lives with my grandparents where he doesn't pay any bills like food , water, or electric, no rent either, and only spends his money on his truck, motorcycle, and weed. He has always been narcissistic and I've always been a vessel for his emotional abuse. He is also emotionally abusive to my sweet grandmother(his mom) and openly shames her and insults her.
Back to my main story.
Since August communication has been off with my dad, he doesn't text regularly or check in. He was essentially just abandoned me at the drop of a hat because he was mad. He has only seen me on holidays and only contacts me relating to holidays or if he wants something from me. But during the whole duration of time I haven't been seeing him and months before, he hasn't been paying any child support. So he's a little below $2000 in debt to my mom. This is where shit gets messy. 

My birthday is coming up very soon and my dad has been contacting me about trying to see me for my birthday, which sounds considerate at first. He has called me twice between Christmas and now to talk to me about it since my 17th birthday is next month, but both times he has called me he has been bragging about the money he has been spending on his 2022 Toyota tacoma which is obviously expensive (he has bragged about spending $9,300 on it the last time I called him). So while contacting me for my birthday he has been bragging about the money he would rather spend on his truck than me, while simultaneously posting his road trip vacations with his girlfriend which are also very expensive. It's clear he is only contacting me when it's convenient for him but if I tell him I don't wanna see him for my birthday for obvious reasons he will totally explode on me.

The easy summary being : I hardly see my dad because he doesn't contact me, when he does he brags about himself and the money he would rather spend on a truck than me, and then fucks off until it's convenient for him to see me again.

I don't know how to stand up to him because he's so incredibly manipulative, I feel the only way it will happen is if I just blow up on him because he doesn't communicate but I wish i knew what to do. He will most likely wanna see me for easter and push me more and more to see me for my birthday when I don't want to. Does anyone have any advice?"
"20M, former college student. I pay my own rent, my apartment is being rented under my name, and I'm working on transferring my other bills to my name too.

"My mom is purposely trying to make me homeless. She refused to let me use one of her FIVE fucking cars to attend an interview because it wasn't for a job she approved of. She insists I’m only allowed to work at McDonald's, which I refuse to do.

She threatens to evict me on my birthday and take custody of my child, claiming I shouldn't be homeless with a child. She repeatedly threatens to call CPS and police if I don't comply with her demands.

"*TRIGGER WARNING FOR ABUSE AND RAPE*

I 14F have been living with my mom since I was 5. She adopted me and my brother (he left home). Growing up I was a really bad kid and was always stealing because I needed attention. I felt like she always treated my brother and her biological son better than me , she always said they were her golden children until they fucked up and it fell on me. Around ten I told my mom that my brother had raped me and had put his hands on me multiple times and that it happened for about 4 years (I was not lying btw) and she didn't believe me until I told her again, or when at 10 I tried to hang myself and when I told her she didn't believe me again and said that it is normal to think those kind of thoughts and she denies never believing me on both accounts. This was the same year I started cutting myself and when she saw it she screamed at me about wanting attention not even about me getting hurt, I tried to commit again and she did the same thing except took my door and wrnt through my phone. She's always been bipolar too and she'd go from telling me to leave her alone , from kissing and hugging on me , to saying fuck you under her breath . Especially after her and my adopted dad got divorced, she started telling me about all of her guy problems and brought over 6 different guys , one of them even broke in. Fast forward to last may , I OD on 300+ pills ( I'm not lying about this either) I genuinely wanted to die and when she found out she said that again I was attention seeking because I ""knew' 300 pain killers could not kill me . So the whole time I was in the mental hospital she would fight with me over the phone about it.  I've told her multiple times about how I am depressed and literally have a hard time even showering and she calls it a excuse but when it comes to her everything is so serious."
Hi I'm 13 and my dad has been abusing my mother since I was young ... Something happened last night and I feel as if this really needs to stop last night he was drunk and tried to abuse my dog (he has done this before) then me and my mother was trying to stop him then he started punching on my mother and I started punching him helping her my little sister was crying and screaming holding our dog and my mom kicked him out he was in the car sleeping this all happened at 3 am so I went to sleep after my mother put him out but I wake up to him back inside the house and i didn't say anything at first but he said he will break my arm if i ever touch him again ... When he was being abusive first by trying to hurt my dog and mom I was helping my mother but now I'm scared I want him to go to jail he been to jail for temp murder before and he lost his gun rights but he keeps taking my mother's gun.. I'm scared he will kill us all one day he is horrible and he has abused my 9 year old sister before and I couldn't do anything but watch  idk what to do i want him gone .
"I have an abusive father that I've completely cut contact with for a few years now. I'm planning on getting married to my partner in the next few years, but it just occurred to me that I have no idea who's gonna walk me down the aisle. So, my question is basically the title. "
"Ever since I was a child I remember my father yelling at others because he spilled ketchup (he also did not let me go to my grandparents house because of this and hit me) or because my mom talked to a male employee for too long (He shattered one of our house doors with how hard he closed them after mom said she was just asking the employee to order some vegetables for her job as a cook). But in the last two years I feel like it’s becoming worse and everytime he starts yelling I fear he will do something to us. The most recent one (happened 30min ago) was because I opened a nutella jar when he already opened one last night and told no one, he smashed both of the jars, threw them in the trash, then started throwing posted, silverware, glasses just anything into the washing machine and yelled at me how I am such a bitch. I also recall that he once broke our front door glass and it was my fault because I was taking a bath and did not open the door for him, he also yelled at me and my mother on my birthday just because he had a bad day and my mother did not clean up flowers when she was after an operation. He usually yells at us after work but he doesn’t go that much anymore so I just want to know what I should do because anytime I tell my friends they just ignore my troubles and change the theme into something completely different."
"Some context: I'm 20, in Uni for 2 years. My parents pay for it all. I live in Thailand. 


Sort of venting, mostly asking for advice. 


CW for physical, emotional abuse.


Its not as though I'm not grateful that my parents pay for my schooling, so much so that I resent the many many caveats that that comes with. 


For one, I've been struggling for the past 2 years. An inability to get any kind of mental heatlh/psychiatric help and general turbulent circumstances/pressure means my GPA has been steadily below 2, with my grades averaging a C. I used to be a solid B+/A student in High School til I was pulled out for financial reasons in sophomore year. But I hate university, and have already proposed to my parents to please stop wasting their money on me and instead put Less overall money into helping me get on my feet for a few months + find a job. They didnt like this idea. 


For two, the aforementioned pressure. Every single time the end of the trimester rolls around I get a sick feeling in my gut. My parents ask for access to my school system (login to see schedules, grades etc) and have actually called me numerous times, messaged me guilting me, and threatened to pull the plug on EVERYTHING including take away my electronics (at 20) for not wanting to hand the login info over. This is what they did just last night and why I'm making this post. 


Adding to that, early last year we had a confrontation because I was failing classes. I made the mistake of trying to hide this from them and proceeded to not only get yelled at, told I was wasting their money, and guilted, but also threatened with actual fucking murder, grabbed/yanked/hit/dragged around by the arms, threatened to be tied up (if this sounds fantastical to you. Imagine how I felt when I first heard them suggest it), and then beat and yelled at some more. The whole ordeal ended in them taking away my electronics while I was at their house for about... 2 weeks, and then guilted more until I had to literally beg for forgiveness and they gave me MY things back. Not to mention holding housing, rent, schooling over my head. 


I'm tired. I feel like an ungrateful brat but I can't keep tearing my hair out over a future that isnt and won't ever be mine and feeling this constant dread every time the end of a trimester rolls around. Again, they wont let me pull out. I proposed the idea. I added up the money necessary (MUCH less than my fucking schooling overall), offered to sell my own belongings (jewelery + guitars) to help pay, everything. I thought they'd be enthused to not have to throw money down the drain trying to keep their ingrate useless child afloat but I realized a long time ago they just... want control over me. 


TLDR: My parents try to control my schooling and financial situation and, despite my struggling in school, refuse to let me pull out and just get a job while also becoming abusive due to my bad grades.


How do I not crack? How do I not let them get to me? And more importantly, how do I get our from under their financial control? Other than obviously getting a job. Please help.

"*EDIT: I've seen a few people talk about my mom, saying if she doesn't step up, she's part of the problem. My mom does step up, she defends me a lot of times. But she's just a person too, and I've seen my dad make her cry multiple times. She's my main supporter, she fights for me and I'm not sure I would be here without her. While I truly appreciate the concern, please don't call her part of the problem. If someone doesn't deserve it, it's her.*



The needed context is I have PCOS which makes it impossible for me to wax my legs because my hair is really thick and it makes it hurt like hell. I am not allowed to shave using a razor, for reasons unknown to me. I am female, turning 18 in a month, I am 158cm (about 5'1 ft) tall and weigh 52.5kg. I am not unhealthy physically apart from dry skin.

&#x200B;

I was getting changed and I realised I forgot my pyjama pants, so I figured I'd head to the kitchen to throw away some trash and then go grab them. I had a shirt on and obviously underwear, which means only my legs were visible. As I walked into the kitchen I heard my father make a weird noise and say ""That's disgusting"" and ""You look disgusting, if you want to make yourself look like that I shouldn't be forced to see you, I don't want to look at ugly things, and this is just disgusting. Do this again and you're grounded""

&#x200B;

He then started telling my mom how ugly and horrible I look and how much I disgust him. I usually don't take his comments personally because I know he's abusive and my therapist told me not to listen to him, but this one really hit me because I've struggled all my life with finding people who liked me, and even now that I have friends, I am nobody's first choice. I'm always the friend they hang out with when their boyfriends are busy. As for me, I have never been in a relationship with someone (not online). I am lonely and my father saying how disgusting I am makes me think that maybe the reason why I can't get a boyfriend isn't that I'm autistic, isn't that I have anxiety. Maybe it's just that I'm a disgusting person. Maybe I truly have a disgusting body. 

&#x200B;

I don't know. It usually doesn't bother me but this time it did. I used to be overweight (64kg at about 154cm/5'0 ft) and I lost 12kg by going to the gym and changing my diet and I now feel comfortable in my body. But maybe I don't look good enough yet. He says I'm dirty, disgusting, smelly and that I look homeless. I don't even know what the point of this post is. Venting I guess. I needed to tell someone and be listened to. And hopefully get some replies. I don't know. Thank you for listening.

So my step dad has been “tickling” my thigh. I’ll try and explain it as best as I can; so he has been putting his hand on my thigh and squeezes it over and over in a short period of time and apparently it’s tickling. Although he hasn’t done it in a while I still feel uncomfortable. My mom and Mimi (grandma) says that in their younger days that my great grandfather (Mimi’s dad and moms granddad) did the same thing to them I do know that my Mimi has done the same thing to me but I don’t feel uncomfortable when she did it but I was like 5 or 6 when she did that. —Is what my step dad did was sexual harassment?—
"I just can't handle this anymore. I am uncomfortable with living in this house with my parents, especially my dad. English isn't my first language so please understand if I make any mistakes. You dont need to read the whole thing,  I just want to interact with some people who will understand me so Ill appreciate it if u leave comments for me. If you go to the end of this paragraph there is a sumary so u can read that one instead too. btw Im 22F.

From 2020 to 2023 I was in college and I could live alone(my parents paid all the fees including my uni and rent, I worked as a tutor for a while tho) and escape from my parents. Not always tho cuz when I didnt get their call/had a boyfriend they used to just storm into my room and yell at  me. they had gps tracking app on my phone too which I found out later and deleted  
I wasn't very happy in university too, I want to find a job which allows me to work from home or requires less social interaction but my parents strongly wanted me to become a teacher so I had to choose elementary education major. I'm very introverted and anxious so it was pretty hard for me, I loved interacting with kids tho.

When I was preparing for the exam last year to be an certificated teacher my anxiety/depression hit the peak and I did several self harm and 4 suicide attempts, and one of them was jumping off a building. It was mostly from the pressure my parents gave me. I broke my spine/right ankle. had to go through 3 surgeries and almost went completely numb in my legs since I hurt my spine. Some part of my right thigh is still numb though it was 3 months ago. And I had to move back with my parents.

I can walk now but Im not allowed go out alone at all since Im ""still healing"" but they bring me to every family event even though I dont want to since Im tired/hurting.  
Ive been getting therapy from my college for the last 2 years and now Im doing it online, also taking meds for my depression. I try my best to get better. But as long as I live with my parents, I dont think I can ever get better. There are some things that I still cant forget/forgive that my mom and dad did to me.

My dad is very impulsive person. He cheated on my mom with a hooker once and when my mom found out, he started crying blaming my mom for everything and tried to stab himself in the stomach in front of me and my younger siblings. And he used to get mad at work and then put that anger on me and my siblings, especially me, verbally and physically.

There was one time he beat the shit out of me and strangled me when I was in high school. I had bruises on my face, in my eye, also on my body. My mom gave me a makeup concealer and told me to cover the bruises and go to school. He said sorry, but when he said sorry he said its partly bcz of me too for getting him mad. My aunt, which was at the time my high school counselor, brought me to the counseling room and told me it is my fault for getting dad mad.

Also when I was in high school I was groomed by an adult man, and when he rped me I confessed it to my parents and they called me a ""whore"" and got mad at me. Later when they were calmed down they did their best to help me but I still cant forgive them.

And when my homeroom teacher told my mom I cant get in the university that my mom wants me to go, she got so mad at me and telling me how disappointed she is at me, and if I wasn't out with a guy getting groomed i couldve gotten a better grade. I took every pills I could find in my house and slept hoping that I dont wake up the next morning, but I ended up waking up vomiting and when my parents found out they called me ""pathetic"", and even though my uncle said they need to take me to the hospital they told him to leave me alone in the bathroom until I finish vomiting. so they rly did leave me alone.

And even though all these were hard enough, the one worst thing that I cant forgive is that when I was severely bullied in elementary school, my mom didnt care and even told me that I dont need to care if I get better grades than them, and my dad told me im a loser for not beating them back. even my teacher didnt care. none of them. And they didnt help me for 4 years, until the kids stopped bullying me since I got so depressed and basically let them just do whatever they do to me and they lost interest.

And now suddenly, they want to interact with me. When I needed it they werent even there or they made it worse. I dont even want to talk to them. I just do my bare minimum like telling them good morning or good night. They are trying to make it up for all those years that they neglected me. And the thing is, I am mad at them but also I feel guilt for feeling mad cuz theyre finally trying to make it up for me. My dad still is a very impulsive person and he gets mad at me when its not my fault. I feel suicidal everyday. I just want to escape.

And what hurts me the most is even though they know Im going through a hard time, they wont change. They wont change their controlling behavior and telling me Im useless. when I was hospitalized I was crying everyday and my mom told me I ended up like this cuz Im spoiled. that they gave me everything I wanted and I still ended up like this. When I had an argument with my dad recently he said he doesnt remember beating me ""at all(it happened almost everyday in my childhood)"" and he always did his best to raise me. Everytime I think about this I feel like Im losing my shit.

I feel shitty everyday. I dont even know if theyre really trying to help me get better. Staying in my room all day is making this worse but they won't let me out at all unless Im with them. they told me Im fat everyday. cuz I gained some weight after taking depression meds and I couldnt exercise at all for 3 months.



I used chat gpt to summarize this.  
Living in this house with my parents, especially my dad, has become unbearable for me. Throughout my college years, I had moments of escape when I lived alone, but even then, my parents' overbearing behavior followed me. Their constant calls, intrusive tracking apps, and unpredictable reactions made me feel suffocated.  
University wasn't much better. I wanted a career that suited my introverted nature, but my parents insisted on me becoming a teacher. The pressure reached its peak during exam preparations, leading to severe self-harm and multiple suicide attempts. The injuries I sustained forced me to move back in with my parents.  
Despite therapy and medication, I still carry deep wounds from my parents' actions. My father's impulsive behavior and past violence, combined with my mother's neglect and hurtful words, continue to haunt me. Their attempts at reconciliation feel insincere, overshadowed by years of neglect and abuse.  
Even now, they refuse to acknowledge their role in my suffering or make meaningful changes. Their controlling behavior and hurtful comments worsen my mental state. Trapped in my room, I yearn for escape, but they won't let me out unless they're with me. Their constant criticism, especially about my weight, adds to my distress.  
Every day is a struggle against suicidal thoughts. I feel lost, unsure if they genuinely want to help me get better or if they're simply trying to alleviate their guilt. The pain of their past actions weighs heavily on me, leaving me feeling trapped and hopeless."
"Hi I’m a 19 yr old college student who is finishing up my freshmen year. My mother shows clear sign of narcissistic personality disorder and has abused me and my siblings for years. After going to college I had high hopes our relationship would improve, as I would have more freedom and been viewed as an adult ( or even just a mature person). However that has not been the case, and even with the physical distance between us the abuse has gotten worse. I am working towards saving up to move out after i graduate college, and trying to get counseling through my school. However I’m not in a position to go no contact with my mother for a multitude of reasons. 

I’ve made the mistake of repeatedly calling out my narcissistic mother on her behavior, this of course only enrages a narcissist. My mother has used this to gaslight me and call me crazy and emotional.

I am looking for advice on how to sort of “swallow my pride” and how to keep cool when an abuser tries to upset you. I’ve tried the gray rock method, however this lack of engagement also upsets my mother more. I can’t bring myself to pretend my mother is a saint, so pretending everything is fine and kissing ass doesn’t work for me. (it’s also not going to be very believable)

Any solutions to keeping your dignity while trying to deal with a narcissist ?"
I started cutting today after an argument with my mom. I want to die so she can feel some kind of pain behind me. She is so stupid she forgets I’m the one she sent to school with Bruises and cuts. She called me a slut at 11 and she told me she would kill me leading to my first attempt at 12. She wished rape and sa on me for years but I’m the one who can’t take accountability .   
"It...it feels like....how do I even put it, my parents did some things to my siblings and I and if they were ever found out, they would probably be locked away for child abuse, but now it's only verbal(rarely) and nobody seems to believe me or care

Example 1;
My father, who 99% of the time now, is funny and caring and nice to be around, beat and whipped me Till I bled and then threw(physically threw me)me into a dark room for six hours, threatening to throw away the key, while I screamed bloody murder, begging to be let out nonstop and that I was sorry, I was around six or seven.

Example 2;
I made something for my parents, and wanted to show them, I tripped and knocked over a vase, destroying both my gift and the vase, the shards stabbed into my skin, but I dare not scream or cry, I tried to glue if back together and was successful, but they later found out and beat me so hard  I collapsed onto the ground almost unable to move, I was nine.

Example 3;
It was my eleventh birthday, my older sister was in a boarding school and it just so happened to be visiting day, I was so excited to see her, I didn't mind sharing my birthday, they completely forgot I existed but I didn't care, I was happily munching away on a snack, when my parents commented on my weight and appearance, saying I looked disgusting, and that I shouldn't eat so much, I stayed in the car until we left, they then grounded me for ""causing a scene"", I didn't say anything, just left.

Example 4;
My brother is a gifted person, he went to highschool from around the age of eight, he was my parents prized possession, though they only ever cared when they could flex with him, he once did bad on a test because of stress, my dad locked him and my brother in his room, beat him until his face would end up with permanent scars, but he wasn't done, he took him with him and around an hour later, came back without him, my mother begged and pleaded, and took one of the other cars to go look for him, she found him on a random street stripped down to his boxers bleeding, he was 13-14

Example 5;
I grew up thinking I was a monster, my mom would scream about how horrible I was and how I ruined her life and how I was nothing but a demonspawn, my parents would say that they would sooner strangle me to death that let me drive them insane, I thought they were right, that I was a horrific demon because why else would this happen to me?, I was nicknamed""useless child"" by them, and would be blamed for everything, only around 30-40 percent I was even vaguely related to (including just being there when something bad happened)

The twist;
One day they just... stopped... aside from verbal, nothing, I grew up feeling fear for my life, just for it to...stop, I found out they essentially thought I was too old for it to be accepted anymore and the same thing happened to my siblings, but my siblings defended them saying it was a ""cultural thing"", 

But....but that's not fair... I'm supposed to just....deal with it!!!????
I'm supposed to accept that I was the problem because my parents were perfect angels!!?????
Nobody would believe me if I tried to say anything, and I just gave up, because now all the physical violence stopped so I've lost my proof, my siblings either side with them or are going no contact with me and my parents the second they can and just don't want any problems until then, so why me, why am I the one at the butt end of the stick, the one who was despised since birth, the curse, I was no angel but I tried to be and was most of the time, so why does it feel like my trauma ""doesn't exist"" when I still have this pain in my chest, why don't I get to sweep my problems under the rug?

"I'm (13f) with adhd and autism, when I was younger I went to a really bad school and my parents were a lot worse then. I have ptsd from a lot of different situations and my parents won't accept it. About 4-5 months ago I left a residential hospital that my parents sent me to. Now that I'm back they keep talking about a contract where if I break down or cry ill get punished. My parents won't let me be a fucking teenager, I wasn't able to get a childhood and now I can't get a teenagehood either. They dissmimiss everything and won't accept that the residential made it worse"
"TW possible SA, As the title says, I posted about my mother saying no one wanted me at a birthday party because I wasn't a popular.well after reading so many comments I started to realize and remember a lot about my mother. For a long time that memory was the main one I could remember about her, but I've started breaking down remembering some of the worse stuff she's done and the idea there could be worse I don't remember or can't. I made a list because I think it can help me to remember. For a long time I just thought I didn't have a good memory but, I just didn't want to.
I remember being a kid and she kept having me pee in cups I asked my dad a few days ago if I had Dr issues or something and he said he was always the one to take me to the dr if I needed because his job gave him better pay leave. After I told my dad this memory he got a horrible sick look, apparently my mom had joked to him when I was 5 that she could make extra money by selling my pee.
One memory that makes me sick is when she used to fill up the bath tub and hold me for hours crying saying ""I'm going to save you from this world"". I think she was planning on drowning me.
When I was young she used to say I was the reincarnated Jesus and she believed I could walk on water if I tried hard enough.
She stole my Nintendo DS I managed to save up for and pawned it, I looked for that thing for years and every time I asked her about it she would say maybe you should clean your room and you might find it.
One memory that sickness me is when she drove me to a motel she and some stranger had s@x in the room with me on the couch in the room, after my mom fell asleep the man came over and sat on the couch with me still fully naked... I don't remember anything other than when we left the motel my mom was crying. I asked my dad if he knew, and he said he knew she was cheating but didn't know she always took me with her. I have snipits of other memories pop up of other motels and men but this one is the most vivid. The man's name was Doc he lived around North Texas.
She used to have my sister and I physically fight each other for her entertainment just like gladiator combat. My sister had my fingernails still in her arms when we were at my mother's funeral. I feel so guilty for how I treated her. I was younger than her and I saw her as the enemy for years.
My mother used to have me ask her for water and if I annoyed her she would deny my request I still have issues with remembering to drink water.
My teacher told her she thought I had ADHD my mom responded by taking me home and locking me in a dark closet for a few hours she let me out before my dad came home.
My mom made it clear I wasn't to tell anyone anything about her.
I wasn't taught to wash myself or brush my hair I don't know how teacher's didn't call CPS I smelled and looked awful I also wore the same clothes to school almost daily.
The one case where CPS was called when the school nurse thought I wasn't being brought to the dr. I told the case worker I was scared of what my mom would do to me because of her coming to my house. She told my mom she knew this case wasn't serious and she wasn't going to really investigate.
My house growing up looked like one from the show horders, I had to waide through garbage, laundry, and organic waste up to my waist to get out the door 
After CPS was called she pulled me out of school and into k12 or as I think of it the worst two years of my life. She had me take care of her cleaning and cooking, she also had me give her insulin and would smack me if it hurt her.
When I lost my first tooth she made me (she had grabbed me by the hair for the whole movie)watch this horror movie about some demon tooth fairy who kills kids for their teeth but can't go in the light. (I don't know the name of the movie). I slept with the lights on for 10 years, when the light bulb burned out I sobbed and had to figure out for myself how to change it or live in the dark I was too short to reach the bulb.
I realize after all this she was a sadistic sociopathic woman, yet I loved her more than life.

"I don't know what to do, or to feel. Is it alright that my mother hurts me after saying something ""disrespectful"" to her? She always kicks, punches, pinches me, and always aims for my face or the back of my head. She said that she only act this way to teach me a lesson, because I'm always quote ""disrespecting"" her. I'm the only one one she does this to, she doesn't hurt any of my other siblings.

Earlier, we were sitting on the couch watching a movie, and she gets up to put a timer on our air conditioner, and accidentally turns it off. It mad me chuckle a bit, so once she was done putting a timer on it, I joked about it to her. ""Ooh, you broke the AC."" I said it in a joking tone and laughed a bit. Then, she answered me with, ""Just shut the fuck up, will you?"" and of course, I was a bit put off by that, so I answered her. ""Geez, kill joy much.."" then she pinched my wrist for some reason. Of course I said ow because it was pretty painful, bit I didn't do anything else but playfully nudge her hand with my elbow. Then, she pinched my arm and said, ""Why did you elbow me?!"" to which I responded. ""Because you punched me!"" At this point I still saw it as a bit of a joke, and that me and my mother were just play fighting, but I guess to her it didn't seem that way. Soon enough, I turned away from her. Then out of nowhere, she hit the of my head with her palm and I did, ""What was that for?"" and she replied. ""You were being disrespectful. Even if I picked you, you have no right to elbow me."" I mean, I didn't put any force into it. ""But it didn't hurt, didn't it? So why did you hit me?"" I then said, ""You're being a disrespectful little bitch, that's why!"" Then I said, ""I would be this way if you didn't keep hurting me, maybe if you didn't pinch me I wouldn't have nudged you."" she replied with ""Go on, one more word out of your mouth and I'll fucking punch you."" and I said ""But I was just joking? Are you really going to hit me because I joked about our air conditioner? What kind of reasoning is that why are you like this..."" I could then sense by then that after that sentence was over that I was done for. ""You never listen, huh?"" She said, right before she pinched the back of my head, and my shoulder, hard. Since followed this with a painful pinch. It was like she dug her fingernails in my skin and skinned the part of my body in which she pinched. This was all pretty painful, even while I'm writing this, I still feel like I've just been punched by her. Of course, after that I stayed quiet, I just felt a feeling in my chest, something that I feel whenever she beats me up or when I'm sad. Like my stomach dropped or something. She still kept going, and running her mouth about his I was so disrespectful, and how much of a bitch I was. And I just had enough, even though I knew that what I was about to say would make her mad, I still said it. ""Won't you just stop already? You've already hit me, you hot what you wanted. Just be quiet and watch the movie."" I move an inch or two away from her, and squeezed my eyes shut, expecting for the worst. She didn't say anything after that, and just punched my shoulder blade, extremely hard. ""You're such a disrespectful cunt! I told you to shut up didn't I? Yet you keep on talking!"" when I tell you, that shit hurt, it hurt bad. It made he just hold my shoulder, and mad me shut shut up for good. I just couldn't take it anymore, and got up to go to my room, ""Don't come back down here, so god help me if I see you down here later, you're going to fucking wish that you didn't go down those stairs.""

I just don't know what to do anymore, everytime we get into an argument, it ends with her hitting, kicking, punching, or pinching me. All I can do is express myself through my words, and be so called ""disrespectful"" to her. Because it's not like I can hurt her, or hit her back. She's my mother, and I have so much respect for her. But sometimes all of this hurt just makes me burst into tears. Each night, I get closer and closer to committing. And she's probably going to be the number one reason as to why I'd kill myself. I've always been pretty suicidal, every since I was nine years old. I've tried and tried opening up to her about the suicidal thoughts that I had been having on multiple different occasions, but they all end up with the same out come. She either hurts me, pushes that fact away, or both. I told her one time, that she shouldn't have had kids if she didn't know how to handle her, and her children's feeling's. But, she just ended up beating me up. I don't even know if I can cry about my experiences on here, because even though what she does is painful, it doesn't leave a scar. So, should I really be yapping if it wasn't bad enough to leave a scar. I don't know. Is my mother in the wrong or am I just overreacting??"
"i (17F) don’t know if i’m being abused or just sensitive. I feel like i’m being verbally and emotionally abused but idk. My dad has always been quick to call me names like bitch cunt asshole brat amongst others, and he always refuses to apologise. The lack of apology didn’t bother me when I was young but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realised that I deserve apologies for things that upset me. Once he called me a bitch and I decided I wouldn’t speak to him unless I got an apology ( i would like to add i don’t give anyone else the silent treatment when fighting i just felt as tho this was the best way to get through to him.) We didn’t speak for 3 weeks and it ended in my mother giving out that dad didn’t like how he was being treated and I was crying asking what about me and how I’m being treated. I understand I started it but i feel like i was justified and just at my tipping point, and also why didn’t he speak to me. Why didn’t it bother him that his eldest daughter didn’t want to speak to him?

I’ve been looking at colleges and at the moment I have my heart set on a college 2 hours away. This would mean I would have to live in student accommodation. I broke down in front of my mom, crying about how me and my dad don’t have a relationship now why would we ever have one when I leave. With the best intentions she told my dad trying to get him to see how he’s pushing us away, he reacted by twisting the narrative. He claimed I wanted to leave because “oh i’m just such a terrible father, just because i’m not ever talkative.” I cried for hours after that conversation.

His love for me and my siblings seems based on how many interests we share with him. We have a farm and personally I don’t have much interest but i help when i can. I find during these times i’m helping he is much nicer to me and I actually feel like i can talk with him. I’m in a stage of school where my final exams are coming up so i’m busy studying. I also play sports and have a job so I can’t farm as often and it’s always a point of contention. I understand he wants help but I feel like roaring that I’m an ungrateful brat just because i have other priorities is unfair.

It all came to a head today, i left school early yesterday because of a headache and i didn’t go in today because of my headache and a cough that has been manifesting over the past few weeks. I woke up after a nap to hear him downstairs giving out about me to my mom. I actually don’t want to repeat it because of how upsetting it was but the basic jist was I’d never do anything with my life because i’m missing school. For some context I am a good student, I always have been. I have won national stem awards, won debating competitions, participated in MUN, travelled abroad for exchanges and different climate change events. FYI these events were mainly paid for by my school. I am consistently top of my class in all my subjects and it’s just shit to hear him disregard all of this because I’ve missed a few days of school. He also accused me of being on drugs, I have no idea where this has come from. I’ve never gone near drugs nor given him a reason to believe i have. There was a lot more but i’m just still trying to process it.

I would just live some advice idk is this just tough love or the way he is or is it actually abuse?"
"My parents make it pretty clear to me they aren’t abusive but they also tell me that was happens in the house stays in the house and there are some times where I feel like something has to be said so this is what happened today keep in mind I am 16 my parents are full grown adults
The story:
i was going down the stairs and I fell and hurt my hip and since i was a bit tired and exhausted i got a bit worked up i yelled and i  opened doors forcefully because i was mad i tell my parents that i am having anxiety about my health and that im feeling burnt out and exhausted and my parents asked what about my health I was anxious about and i said “why im constantly getting sick all the time” and they pulled the “you dont manage it well enough (my sinuses)” and i already knew that but they also know ive done everything i could and nothing has worked i talked to my doctor about that last week and they gave me some new stuff im going to try tonight so anyways after that little emotional blow up of mine and resisting the urge to cry i without knowing slam the closet door shut and my dad says he is “gonna come punch me like i punched that door” and then after that they bring up the fact that i may or may not need to be dropped off at a mental hospital again like wtf that set me off and here i am now
Short version: 
in short my dad threatened to punch me and held a fist towards me and threatened to send me back to a mental hospital all because i was having a bit of a meltdown and a rough week"
"Hi, sorry but im sick of this and i need advice or something. ive been dealing with abusive behavior for years.

For months my mother has been telling me to get rid of old clothes. She kept on telling me she was going to throw out my clothes and even threw out a few without telling me (I only found out because I couldn't find them at all in the house. Still haven't found them ANYWHERE).

She blamed my dog that I recently adopted for the holes but it doesn't look like the dog bites/holes in her clothes or the clothes of mine. I sew so I know the difference between a rip or hole made by something sharp (like dog teeth). I have sewing scissors I keep in my sewing box that I keep out in the open. The cuts are not small and ragged like dog teeth holes (he's a puppy and a small breed), they are whole ass 1- 2 inch long clean cuts with no ripping. The dog bites are all over the clothes and the cuts are in areas only like the crotch, armpit, and chest. There are even clean straight cuts on threads that where holding down buttons on one of my old shirts. I can't even sew the right buttons on because they are completely missing!

I'm running out of clothes. This really scares me because when I was 10 she straight up cut the clothes off of me. It's making me get flash backs to other things too. She calls me a fucking psycho when I call her out on her abusive behavior what the fuck do I do? I want to leave but I have nothing and I have pets to take care of. I'm scared to leave my pets with her because she might hurt them. She used to threaten me to come back because she said she would give away my pets. One needs meds everyday and I also have a lizard so I need to spray her terrarium everyday.

edit: I am an adult. She still does this shit to me as an grown ass adult."
"So I've been wanting to post here for a while but couldn't. Now that I've finally found enough courage to do so, I figured out that there's a lot I want to get off my chest. It began since I was a child tbh. Kids make mistakes and I was no different. My father never had enough time for me and I completely understand this. My mother however wanted me to be a 100% all the time. Even machines aren't 100% efficient how can I be? Even for my smallest of mistakes I got beaten. I had a problem with my stomach when I was a child I used to vomit everything I used to eat, and guess what? Got beaten for wasting food and her effort like that. But that was a long long time ago I kinda buried that in my past. I was a dropout as I didn't understand the degree program I was in. It was mechanical engineering and before you ask why did I choose it for myself, I didn't. My parents did, as usual. They've had complete control over my life. But I did what I wanted and dropped out in the last year and started pursuing what I wanted. Just to clear some stuff, it's no use talking to them about issues either because they just don't understand and they think what they tell you is the only thing best for you. What happened a few months ago is something I can never forgive them for. There was a girl I was in a relationship with for 3.5 years approximately. We were good together and the girl wanted me to marry her. Since I'm a Pakistani and my culture doesn't allow me to leave my parents out of any decision I take for myself, it was mandatory for them to meet her parents for the proposal. They were going there just because I forced them to. Not because it was something I wanted or for me to be happy. And then, just as usual, they rejected her by telling me that she's not upto the mark (which they were completely wrong about as they didn't even know her very well). I can't do much to break this loop where my parents control my life to the point where I get depressed and there's no awareness about depression here in Pakistan. I just can't escape this life and do feel suicidal at times. I sometimes still feel like I'll be able to marry her when I'm capable enough but I'm running out of time I guess as her parents will find someone for her. I have developed anxiety issues just because of them. There's no use of talking to them about anything. I'm becoming a bad person just because of them as I've stopped seeing positivity around me because of their behavior. They taunt me and push me down everytime. I never ever heard a word of motivation from them. I keep my stuff to myself as I know they don't deserve to know what goes on in my life. I just need help but I don't know how. Can't talk to anyone as I only have a few friends and they can't relate with me because they're lucky to have good parents with whom they have a good bonding and a loving relationship. I don't know how to fix my life."
"So, recently I tried to commit and I sent my friend a lengthy message (in base 64, my mom and i share a phone number so she can see what I tell other people and so she can block the friends I have that she doesn't like) and he ended up calling the police, and when they left my mom yelled at me for being selfish and inconsiderate. (This is the same woman who is attempting to use my birthday to get the things she wants, the same woman who makes me take care of my sibling and her, the same woman who's belittled, gaslighted and guilt tripped me for the past 10 years of my life (I'm 14), the same woman who tells all her friends that I'm the problem and that she's 'doing her best' when she's on her ass all day doing nothing but ordering me around) Then the day after that, the police came back to explain some things to her (In the letter I sent to my friend I had told him I was SA'ed when i was younger (4-9)) and that they were going to open a case as well as call cps to investigate our home (which is a mess, I'm trying to keep it clean, I am, but some days I can't even get myself to change clothes let alone clean an entire house, not to mention my sister who doesn't really have to do anything, even the chores she does have, I have to end up doing them for her because she refuses to do them, then when I feel burnt out and just want to tune the world out i get yelled at and called lazy.) So, today she made me clean the entire living room and kitchen (there was mold under the freezer. And kitty litter everywhere. AND. SO. MUCH. TRASH.) then, when I finally got done at 8:00 pm (I had been cleaning since 2pm right after I got home from school) she accused me of 'stealing her tweezers from her bathroom' which I did not. Then she yelled at me for not getting the dishes done (even though I WAS CLEANING H E R AND HER CROTCH GOBLIN'S FILTH UP) Not to mention I still have to mop the bathroom and do the laundry and change the kitty litters, then I have to organize our room and re-sweep the bedroom. I feel burnt out and tired. I don't know what to do anymore, anytime i try to get help, it always backfires. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't want to be here anymore. I'm beginning to think that I'm just destined to be trapped here. She's found ways to keep me here forever. She uses my sister against me and favors her over me, she says I'm the quote ""bad kid"". And sure she has her good moments (most abusive parents do), but, I don't wanna take care of her anymore, it's starting to cause me issues in keeping my grades up. I wanna be a kid, and enjoy my life.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What do I even do at this point? Is there even a solution?? I just want to feel like I can enjoy myself without that fear in the back of my mind."
"So me and my mom just got into another fight where she yells at me and calls me degrading names while i (forcibly) sit there and take it, and today she said ""If you don't pull your shit together, I'm gonna stop caring. Then nobody will care, and when that happens, you're fucked. When that happens, you'll end up homeless on the road living behind a dumpster."" and that evoked some sort of feeling within me apart from me already crying.

So now I wonder; Is saying that some sort of abusive/manipulative tactic for a toxic parent to use to make their child feel super codependent on them, or am I just being dramatic? "
Im 23 and autistic  my parents and grandparents wont let me get a drivers license cant have a job and have a bank account i need help on what to do sorry im not very good with details ill answer any questions
" 

Okay, I made a reddit account to ask this.

Am I abused, and could I maybe live with my grandmother

(I spent an hour writing this post and accidently deleted everything right as I was about to post it so now I'm PISSED and I can't write it all again so it's gonna be paraphrased. Sorry)

See, I want to go to court to live with my grandmother, but I'm not sure if I can, because I don't know if I'm even abused. It just....FEELS like it. I'm 14m and don't want to spend the rest of my years as a minor wishing I could live with my grandmother because my mother makes me feel like shit.

So, not sure if I can say everything that goes on in my life in one post, but I'll try to get the main parts.

So my mother I have always loved, always thought she was amazing, until about 2 years ago when I started talking to friends and hearing about their lives compared to mine. It was just small stuff to start, like I grounded a lot and my friends got to go to fun places 100 times more than I ever did, but then I starting thinking about how much I don't ask for. My friends like to do stuff, it just become life for them, they ask for stuff, yeah, cause people want stuff. But me, I barely asked for ANYTHING. Because I knew we were dirt poor and my mom is always is pain. And I got used to pretty much everything being a no. So, fine, whatever. Fast forward a year and I started envying other people, I wanted to do stuff, I wanted to hang out with my friends, I wanted to DO things instead of being screamed at everyday. My mother seems to think every tiny thing is my fault, even when I know I didn't do anything. I'm expecting to clean, and do things proper, but when I finish my cleaning she says I barely do anything to help the house. So I express that I would like to, but I'm not allowed to organize the house and start cleaning without her permission. (This is as much as I saved, everything else got deleted) Anyways, there was a incident with food, I took some things from the fridge, I know, I shouldn't have, but I was always hungry, my mother always ate all the really good food like chips and ice cream (We RARELY even get that stuff) I'm not allowed to get food when I want it (I'm not starved FYI) and she found out, major trouble, still in trouble, but anyways, so besides that, when our apartment get slightly damaged, like a small dent, I can pretty much expect a 30 minute screaming session targeting at me, and the next to days shunned, and treated like a monster. Skipping ahead, I got a piece of shit phone when I was 13 as my ""first phone"" crappy flipphone, no internet, didn't even work right (It's still my phone) and my mother sits on her ass all day doing shit on her phone and looking at my texts through her phone, and crap. She either can be screaming and brutal, quiet and pissed off, rampaging, OR on a rare day, decently nice. I believe she is so horrible all the time cause she's in pain and has medical issues, and I get that. I just...can't see myself screaming at my family because I'm in pain. I can't see myself tearing them down after says how much I love them moments beforehand.

Sorry, this is kind of all over the place, I just am afraid to go to court or tell my grandmother what I go through, because if I do and the court denies me, my life at home will go from absolute shit to hell from another dimension, not kidding. But if I can get out. I WANT TO. So fuckin bad. But I don't want to go to an orphanage or something. My grandmother isn't perfect, but she is a million times better than my mother. So, advice please? Thank you.

Note: I am not physically abused, emotionally abused, I think, POSSIBLY verbally, but mostly it's just screaming and trying to make me feel as horrible as possible, she rarely calls me names (When she does she denys it) So I dunno if it would count.

Sorry for long post. I just kinda had it. (Don't have time to review this so if smt doesn't make sense- sorry."
"tonight is another very loud night i suppose,  my dad just hit me and threw my tablet and phone across the room. its 12.30 am so i think hes mad because im sleeping later than usual. im not playing my phones or anything. i was writing on my notes app about some presentation thats due tomorrow and its something i need to revise. im 13 years old and im his only daughter and only child. my mom doesnt live with us, not divorced but she just works far away and probably went away to get away from my dad too. every week there has to be atleast like 4 yellings from him. from tv smashing, and to taking it out on my pets. tonight i made some hot tea because i have to get up early for tomorrow and i dont feel like breakfast and tea always helps, right? well no. this man just dumped the wholr thing into my aquarium . I dont knoe ehat to do anymore :( my dad never lets me see my mom often, too. right now im laying in my bed in a bright room, because earlier he opened the lights and told me to not turn it off so im forced to sleep in brightness?? and he also took my air conditioner remote. so, hot night for me. happened before but i can handle it i guess. my phonr and tablet is not with me. im using my old android and my tablet and phone is at the other room which i cant take since my room is bright which will make it impossible to sneak by. its my fault for sleeping late and i had the whole day to do this project but i dont think i deserve this kind of treatment at such a young age. i dont know ehat to do with my aquarium its the only thing i have. i spent months just to get the ph right and the shrimps alive and he just dumped shit on me like this. im so done with this guy. how can i ever leave????"
So my stepdad is very emotionally abusive and sometimes physically with putting me and my sister in headlocks and threatening to put our heads through walls. My mom usually sees what he does but she can’t leave him because for one she’s gets disability checks so she doesn’t work and my sister is about to move out. I think the worst thing that he has done is either slap me in the face or grabs mine and my sister’s thigh and “tickles” us by squeezing his hand over and over. Hopefully I put some pictures of him getting mad.
"(From what I was told by my mother*:) When my mother was pregnant with me, my father would hit my mom and abuse her and manipulate her, as far as what my grandma told me. When I was born my father would sexually abuse me and my grandma kept me away from him as much as she could. 

(From what I remember*:) When I was 5, and my little sister was 1,my father would drive me and my sis to his house to play Video games to ""make friends"" with me, then take me home. 

One time however, my father didn't want to change my little sister's diaper and made me do it. (Remember, I was 5 at the time) I struggled to change my sister's diaper, and my father kept knocking on the door just to freak me out the whole time. 

I also remember being in bed then my father would undress me and would make me sleep in bed with him, I thought it was normal at the time. 
Then after a few hours of that my father would dress me again then drive us back to my cousins house, where we lived at the time. 

If it weren't for my grandma, I'd still be in that situation. I'm in my double digits now yet not ""fully mature"" yet but I'm sure this is worthy of being here. Just so y'all know, most of this happened years ago and doesn't effect me now, just thought it would be ok to post here. "

"But I can't. 

Instead I go on hating myself to a point where I can't even stand myself. "
"My mom and I(24f) have had a pretty strained relationship since I was a teenager. She was pretty verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive to me throughout my teen years and early 20s and abused me while I was in abusive relationships too. She often talked crap about me to other family members and turned my immediate family against me during some of the hardest times of my life. The mistreatment / abuse from her stopped in 2022 when she found out I was experiencing suicidal ideation after the end of my second relationship which ended terribly. Ever since then, she’s been trying to be a better mom and has been trying to be more loving / supportive. She’s been apologetic about certain things, she wants us to do things together and have a better / closer relationship. In some ways, I appreciate her efforts. But most of the time, I resent her and the fact that it took me wanting to k*** myself in order for her to see me as a human being. I still have random flashbacks of horrible things she did or said to me. I don’t trust her and I don’t want to have a close relationship with her. I feel strained and tense because I still live at home so I have to see and be around her. I feel like she forces herself onto me. Always wanting to talk to me or hug me or be involved in my life. I daydream about moving out and not having contact with her for a long time. I’m making this post because I had one of my flashbacks this morning after waking up and I felt angry all over again. Idk what to do. I know I have to move out and I’m saving for it, it just feels impossible with the costs of housing. Any advice would be appreciated. Thx. <3

TLDR: I’m seeking advice on how to navigate not wanting a relationship with my mother while still living under her roof."
"Im a 18 year old guy and I’m really not sure what to do, my parents have the worst financial decisions I’ve ever seen which puts them broke when they need to pay bills, and they come to me taking my money for bills/food etc,

 I try to tell them no since I’m starting college very soon but they guilt trip and manipulate me telling me it’s my fault if we’re homeless and it’s my fault if they jump off a bridge, im really not sure what to do anymore "
"Hi I’m new to this group and I’m hoping this is a safe space where I can share everything that has happened to me. 
 
TW this story can get kind of graphic so if you don’t think you can handle it please don’t read this.🖤🖤🖤

My bio dad wasn’t ready to be a father. His father had abused him and thrown him threw a brick wall when he was a young teen (I’m not joking) I believe he felt that he should treat me and my siblings the same because that’s what he knew I guess. 


He abused my two older siblings and my mother while I was still in her womb. He picked up my older sister (Savannah) by her hair when she was 6 because she didn’t want to clean her room, he shook her by her hair and yelled, “Do you want to clean now?!”. He did it again and picked her up by her French braids and swung her around the room.

He picked up my older brother (Caleb ) by his neck when he was three then dropped him like a sack of potatoes. When my mother was pregnant with me he backed her into a corner and punched a hole in the wall right next to her head. She punched him in his nose and broke it but he beat on her until she regretted it.  

Fast forward to me being 10 years old we  had our new house put in. We were so excited, but the torment only seemed to get worse as time went on. My dad had been gone for a few months and I didn’t think he was coming back but I was wrong.
 
He came back and lived with us again, he beat us with a belt and screamed at us daily. He was a big smoker he vaped, smoked cigarettes and all of that. I was the vulnerable one I didn’t have any control over my emotions at all I couldn’t even be in the same room with him without crying. And I would get beat more for that my mother had to work because the sorry piece of shit that is my father wouldn’t. 

I have another little sister (Hannah) and she was little during all of this so my mom protected her more. But every once in awhile he would start to hit her and I protected her and shielded her from him. Fast forward to 2020. My mom got covid, I was there to help her she was so sick it felt like it wasn’t even real. I got off the bus one day from school and I walked in the house. 

Her fingers,nose and toes were purple and she was gasping for air. My sister tricked her into going to the hospital by saying she was taking her to whataburger because she was hungry. My older sister was fifteen and had a permit. She got to the hospital and the doctors told my sister that if she hadn’t of been there for 2 more hours she would have been dead. 

She was in the icu for 3 months, but it only got worse from there. Me and my siblings were staying with my really close family friends. I was outside and just gotten home from school. They live on 4 acres and have a pretty long driveway. ( ps I had to get picked up from school everyday early because my dad tried to kidnap me from my school).

I was sitting on the swing bench around the fire pit in the front yard and a green Kia that looked like my sisters had been following us and had come up there road and gone back and forth continuously for a week or so. 

He tried to kidnap me and my siblings from their house we were in hysterics. He ended up leaving after he got told by the police he couldn’t take us. But that didn’t stop him. He tried to kill my mom in the hospital by saying he was her husband and he wanted to pull the plug. He sent his girlfriend up there to get info on her saying that she was my mother’s sister.

We had to put a code on any info on her so that if you didn’t know her code you couldn’t get any info on her. He terrorized me and my siblings we couldn’t even go outside without being terrified. 




Fast forward to me being 13 my mother is out of the hospital and doing great we are so lucky she’s still here with us today, but things got worse for me. I got SA (sexually assaulted ) by my family’s friend. We had grown up with them our whole life I never would have thought he would ever do something like that. His dad was like my dad he fathers me and my siblings still like were his own.

He SA me over and over for almost a month straight before I told my older sister Savannah she was 18 and his former girlfriend she broke up with him. Then I learned that he had done it to her and my cousin also. Jasper (18 ) was my assaulter I was only 13. I can still feel his hands on me sometimes and it makes me sick.


I was just a kid but that never lasted long I’ve had to have the mindset of n adult since as long as I can remember. I didn’t have a childhood we were and are not rich at all we sometimes wonder how we are going to get things done by a deadline well my mom anyway. 


I’m now 14 and I got caught vaping, smoking and doing other really bad things I shouldn’t be. This was in the beginning of February. I’m better now but my mom was so disappointed in me but my older siblings are under age and they do worse. 

My mom lashes out on me if I tell her how I really feel I cut off my emotions so long ago I don’t know how to turn them back on I can’t cry anymore I’m just numb I disassociate and flinch when someone raises there hand to give me a high five I apologize too much and I get clingy easily.

And I’m sorry for anyone who is reading this if you had the same thing or worse happen to you I wouldn’t be here without my best friend Chasey she saved me from killing myself last year. And my little sister Hannah I love her so much I’m all she has our other siblings don’t give two shits about us I moved out of my moms house and in with my grandma and two aunts they are gentle and never yell I’m so happy. Here 

But I must admit writing this has taken a toll on me because of the memories but I’ll be okay.

There is way more to the story than this but I’ll save more for another day 


Please don’t judge if you read this 

But can you tell me whether my father deserves to be in prison? 

He already had multiple warrants out for his arrest but he a a professional criminal. 

Anyways thankyou for reading loves 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 

Sorry it’s so long

"As Ive mentioned I have trouble picking up social cues sometimes and with how my mom raised me its easy for me to jump to the ""theyre manipulating me"" cue. And i know that my grandma can do the same. Was this one of those instances? At this point its all sorta muddled together. 

I am on low contact with them overall she is someone i talk to more where as my mom i only do so like every few months. Also idk if its relevant context but my mom has been on a downward spiral health wise and likely mentally.
 I did cut out a portion but it just had my stepdads name and she just said that she told them to get disability 3-4yrs earlier. So didnt seem too relevant.

After my message she stopped talking to me for a few hours and basically kinda ignored what I said and just started asking me to get my moms medical history. She wants me to call around but 
1) i work graveyard
2) i hate phone calls; like anxiety lvl
3) i dont think we can help someone who doesnt want help? 

She got herself mixed with a shitty man who; isnt my stepdad. Turned my stepdad into a literal door matt. Refuses to cut contact with the shithead. She is too finicky one minute she wants him there the next she doesnt. I understand patterns of abuse and know she isnt well but hell even the cops dont want to go to that house which is a whole other problem. So I dont know how i could help. 

Hell i went on a whole rant sorry.

Point is I dont know what my grandma wants from me. An I held her in a good light growing up but these past few years Ive more than realized that most the adults used me as a Therapist growing up and she wasnt an exception to that. And I just wanna know if my realization of that is clouding my judgement or just making the manipulation cues more obvious."
"I mean it’s been a while since I’ve felt fucked up but I thought once I left or went away from the source of those feelings, I would feel so much better but I dont. I find triggers and feel threatened with the smallest things. I constantly feel the need to hate myself and find myself to shelter myself from people. I really want to go back to being content with being by myself but I have a hard time doing so. I have a hard time feeling happy. I have a hard time feeling okay. I have a hard time pretending like I’m okay. I’m tired of pretending. I was so good at that shit in highschool but now I can hardly do it. I’m so drained and I find so passion or pull to do it. I just want to tell people I hate them because I genuinely hate everyone cuz they will always find a way to hurt me and make me feel bad and less and awful. I just find happiness with myself and myself alone. "
"This is going to be a very very long story.  

I’m gonna start by describing my family’s situation.

On my mother’s side :

My great-grand-parents were very successfull and had a lot of kids : 3 boys and 2 girls. The men in the family also became successful, got married and had kids. The youngest of the girls has trisomy and couldn’t live alone, the other girl is my grand-mother. My grand-mother wasn’t as successful as her brothers. She met my bio grand-father, who turned out to be very abusive, and they had my mother. My bio grand-father hated my mother because she was a girl and he wanted a boy. He abused her and my grand-mother and then left to have 3 boys with someone else who ended up breaking up with him because he was still abusive. My grand-mother ended up meeting my grand-father and had my aunt.

On my father’s side :

I honestly don’t know much because my father isn’t one to tell stories about his family, I know that my grand-father worked at the bank while my grand-mother worked in whatever government stuff but they lacked nothing. My father was fat as a child and he clearly has a complex about it, he blames his mother all the time for that and hates fat people.

I had to do some research about my father’s life because he is very secretive. He wrote a lot of books that can’t be bought anymore, none of them are being sold, except for the only book that he published himself, but looking at all the boxes full of his book, I guess it didn’t work. From what I could find, he mastered a lot of degree. He always told us that he owned a company when he was younger but I couldn’t find anything about it. I did find a company that he worked in at some point but that’s pretty much all.  

Now how those two families got together.

My father (53yo) was married to one of my mother’s cousins. My mother (43yo) was 15yo when she met him at a family gathering. But only started a relationship when she turned 18. My father had my older brother Kevin(26yo) with his ex-wife at that time. When my older brother was born, he was the golden child of the entire family, everyone doted on him and he has been allowed to do anything he wanted as he grew older. I (23nb) am an affair child. My existence had to be hidden from everyone. My father only aknowledged me when I was 1yo after my mother told him that he had no legal rights over me as he didn’t reclaimed those at that time because « it would be too hard for my older brother. ». At that time, my mother was already pregnant with my sister Melany(22yo). My father ended up divorcing his ex-wife and married my mother.

When it happened, my mom’s entire family shunned her, calling her a slut and she was not allowed to any family meetings anymore, even my grand-mother rejected her. The only person who protected her was my great-grand-father who was very ill and died when I was 4yo.

Soon after Melany’s birth, my mother got pregnant again with my little brother George (21yo). Due to financial difficulties, we had to move a lot. I can’t tell you much about that part of my life because I was very young obviously. I remember playing with my younger siblings, I remember that we would always had very violent game and it always ended up with me having nosebleed. I remember hearing my mother screaming and seeing my father beating her.  

It happened when I was 5yo. My parents were fighting again and I had a nosebleed due to my older brother violently kicking me in the face. I went to ask my mother for help and my parents and I went to the bathroom. I honestly cannot remember what they were fighting about but my father punched my mother in the face so hard that she was actually thrown against the wall. Her face became big and all purple and she ran outside as quickly as possible and locked herself in the car. My father unable to get her out, came back and put us to bed. The next morning, police officers came with my mother. She told them that he was beating her, her face obviously being the proof of it. They responded by saying that there was nothing that they could do, that it was only a couple’s fight and that if my mother was that unhappy, she should get a divorce and they then left.  

I had a huge black out, and when I was 7yo, my parents were not living together anymore. The divorce procedures had started, and they had split custody. My father’s appartment was unsanitary, which caused me to have huge asthma crisis. Of course my father never treated me for it and it all fell on my mother’s shoulders, it unfortunately didn’t work and I still have trouble with my asthma. Both of my parents were working but my mother didn’t have much money as she had to gave up her studies when she got pregnant with me and my father never allowed her to go to uni and ordered her to be a stay at home mom. Since my father never paid child support, we were having a hard time at my mother’s. Fortunately for my mother, she met someone when I was 9yo and moved with him at the other side of the country, which allowed all of us to have food on the table.

My father’s mistreatment towards us started almost as soon as he moved in his appartment. I was diagnosed with depression and an eating disorder at 7yo, my father was with me at the doctor’s appointment. He never informed my mother it, I never saw that doctor ever again. My father gave me some paracetamol for a week and then claimed I was fully healed (spoiler alert : I was not). To « heal » me from my eating disorder he applied a technique used by many parents : not allowing your kid to leave the table until they finish their food. Leading me to spend most of my nights sleeping on the table.  

My father distrust in doctors was so bad that once, while we were having dinner, Melany shared with us that she had been having trouble pooping for a week. Instead of taking her to a doctor, my father decided to put some gloves on and to « unblock » the path. He sexually assaulted her. I remember the screams and the blood as he was doing it in front of us. I clearly remember his face while doing it. And it wasn’t the face of someone who felt guilty about it. He was proudly smiling the whole time. When my mother learned about it, she tried to talk to the police and to doctors but they denied her the help, saying that my father did the right thing. Later that year, he met my step-mother Agatha (49yo).  

The first rule that my father instaured when we met Agatha was to obey her as our own mother, but not view her as our mother as she hated kids and didn’t want any. A fact that Agatha would constantly remind us during my childhood. Their relationship was very chaotic. Agatha and my father would constantly argue. Everytime she left after an argument, my father would start destroying whatever he could find. I remember seeing him destroying the oven because it burned the pizza (the pizza was burned mostly because my father was too busy fighting with Agatha to check on it). I think it’s after this event that my father would let my sibling and I, 8yo at that time, cook for ourselves, as he was too busy again fighting with Agatha.  

When my mother left with her ex-boyfriend, my father got full-custody and we moved to Agatha’s house. Since my mother didn’t have any money, the judge ruled that she would not pay child support. We would only see her during the vacations.

My mother’s new appartment was really small, Melany, George and I had to sleep on the couch as there was no room for a proper bed. We would rarely see my former stepdad during those vacations, he worked in the army and was away most of the time. Their relationship lasted 2yo (I think) but they ended up breaking bc he cheated on my mother. During those 2 years, he was pretty nice but it wasn’t the kind of environment good for kids. They would always go out to party while locking us in a room with no food, water or access to the toilets. The party would usually start around 6pm and end very late at night or the next morning. I know that my mother was having a really hard time so I don’t blame her anymore. But as a child, I thought she didn’t care about us and didn’t want us around. I tried to talk about it with her recently and she doesn’t even remember that she went to those parties while we were around so I decided to leave it be. My eating disorder didn’t get better and around the end of the relationship, my former stepdad decided to instaure a new rule to force me to eat : not allowing me to drink water. If I wanted to drink, I had to wait for them to leave the room and secretly grab a glass. After their breakup, my mom met her now husband Matthew (40yo). Matthew is basically the father I never had. He always goes out of his way to protect my mother and he cares about us. They had my little sister Alice (10yo).

Back to my father.

When we moved to Agatha’s, we also had to change school. Melany was the only one who was accepted by the other kids. I was rejected by them because my classmates « didn’t like strangers » so I would spend most of my time with Melany, which bothered her a lot, she thought I was « stealing » her friends. As for George, we didn’t know it at first since they separated him from us, but he was getting bullied everyday. He was 6yo at that time. At some point George was fed up with it and insulted them back. It was the first time he used a swear word and the kid immediately reported it back to the teacher and got our parents involved. What basically happened is that my father was very angry about it and took us to the other kid’s house. I thought he would listen to George’s side of the story but no. He made my brother apologised to the kid and the mother. And on our way back, he stopped the car, took our little brother out and left him on the side of the road. He brought Melany and I home while we were crying and screaming at him to take back George. George was left 30 min alone on the side of the road, unsupervised.

Agatha’s house was really nice at the beginning. I had to share a room with my sister but there was enough place to keep our intimacy. But it quickly went bad. My sibling and I were crying every night for our mother and my father would yell at us to shut up, telling us that our mother never loved us and abandonned us. We had to cook and clean because « we were living rent free ». When I went to middle school, my father instaured a bunch of unreasonnable rules :

&#x200B;

* I 	was not allowed to leave anything in the locker
* I 	had to carry around all the school books all the time
* If 	it was not actively raining or snowing I had to go on bike
* If 	I was sick, I wasn’t
* When 	I was getting bullied, I had to shut up and leave them alone because 	« they would get tired of it » SPOILER ALERT : 	BULLIES NEVER GET TIRED OF IT

All these rules leaded to a lot of health issues, my back started to hurt so badly, I wasn’t able to sit, lay down or stand up without screaming. Even now my back hurts and I still don’t know what I have because my father yelled at 11yo me so hard to stop screaming because I was only doing that for attention and the only thing I had to do is bear with the pain. And I was so afraid that he would kill me so I stopped screaming. My eating disorders and depression got worse, but then again, my father kept claiming that I was okay. I passed out multiple times during middle schools and my father would claim it only happened because I didn’t want to go to class, I threw out blood and my father only said that I was being over dramatic and send me back to school the next day, I would have asthma crisis so bad that I quite literally almost died once. A car hit me once and other kids, and someone called my father while an ambulance came and took the kids and me to a hospital. I never saw any doctor that day because as soon as I got to the hospital, my father took me out of it and brought me back to school, saying that nothing happened, that he knew who the person who hit us was and that he was a nice guy. Every time I brought up me being bullied I was dismissed with stuff like « Yeah we know, it’s just you, it’s normal », « just leave them be, why do you even care about what they think ?», « What do you want us to do ? Change school ? How are we supposed to do that ? ». So for 4 years, I had to endure of course people insult and laugh at me, but also people pushing me, grabbing my hair, pushing me to the ground, hitting me, grabbed my arms and make me touch kid’s intimate parts (those kids were also getting bullied), throw my stuff, or for exemple when I got hit by the car, directly telling me that I should’ve just died.

At home, my father and stepmother would quite literally blame us for anything that would happen, whether we were involved in it or not. From the moment I was 9yo to now, my father would call me a manipulative compulsive crazy and hysterical liar, an ungrateful princess, saying that I was creating memories because I was an attention seeker. Agatha kept saying that she was glad we weren’t her real kids because we were such horrendous ones and if she was our mother, she would have beaten the shit out of us. That was only during the week. It would get worse on the weekends, when Kevin was around. He was a spoiled brat, some kind of king who was clearly used to boss people around. He was allowed to beat George and I because it was a « child’s fight » even when my little brother would get beaten so hard that his face would get purple and all swollen. Even when that happened my father wouldn’t scold Kevin until my mother and her lawyer contacted him. And even after that, he would yell at us to stop telling our mother what was happening at our father’s house because « it doesn’t concern her ». Quite a few things was « none of her business » according to my father like schools, our health, our grades, our life in general.

It all got worse when Kevin’s mother gave my father the full custody. Kevin was basically a nightmare at his mother’s house, he proudly told me that he pushed someone to suicide once, and he never stopped being a bully in highschool and uni after moving in with us. He purposely flooded his mother’s house because he thought it would be fun, he was 15yo at that time, mature enough to know what you can and can’t do. At first my father was all over his golden child, sympathazing with him. It quickly stopped. Kevin was always fighting our father. My father was getting more and more violent.  

After Agatha got pregnant with my sister Sally (10yo), the atmosphere got even worse. The slightest inconvenience would create disproportionate mesures. Because of the pregnancy, Kevin had to sleep in the same room as Melany and I. We were always in conflict because of the light, the alarm, the music. When Kevin and my father had an argument, it would always end up in my father physically assaulting my brother, and then getting us involved in it. My father would yell at us to say things like « obviously we’re not scared of you » while we were crying, he made us thank him for beating us because we were bad children and how are parents supposed to educate their kids if they can’t beat them. When my sister and I started to have our period, Agatha would forbade us to use her pads and my father wouldn’t buy us ones, stating that he had once « a girlfriend that was able to keep the blood in » so I only had to do that, he never took my period cramps seriously. He would constantly yell at us to choose between him and my mother. When I was so sick that it was clear for everyone that I couldn’t go to school, he would yell at me that I was lazy and that I could at least have done something to help. I started to have night paralysis from 7yo to 16yo, he never took those seriously, called me crazy, an attention seeker, that I only needed to sleep and that if I couldn’t it was because I didn’t want to.

When Sally was born (I was still in middle school at that time) my father decided that it was time to move out and started to look for houses to buy. Agatha got pregnant with Ariane (8yo) and it was more and more obvious that the house was too small for 6 children. We moved soon after I entered highschool into a huge house. It was a really big place that only had one HUGE issue, but not that huge obviously for my father, the house was basically in ruins. Everything had to be renovated, and when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. Agatha gave birth. But the house was in such shambles that I had to take care of everything while they were renovating the house. I had to take care of the babies, of the food, of the laundry, of the cleaning, while going to a new highschool. I was bullied yet again in that new highschool because I stood up for someone and they didn’t like it. Thankfully it only lasted for the first year, I was left alone after that. I met very good friends who taught me how abused I was and saved me on many occasions. During the 6 years I spent in that new « house », I became a maid. I had to take care of everyone and do everything because my father and Agatha would be too busy fighting over anything. Now to describe the « renovated house ».  

At first we basically had no roof, so the house was always cold and when it was raining the ground would be flooded. After we had a roof, he started to do things as he wishes without really concerting us. The bathroom lacked intimacy, anyone could see you on the toilets, he also installed windows in the wall connecting the bathroom to the living room, meaning that anyone could see you taking a shower if they wanted to. He installed windows in the wall connecting my bedroom to the living room too when I was 16yo, meaning that everyone could see me. I had to hide in a corner everytime I wanted to get change or just wanted intimacy. Melany never had a real bedroom, there was no door at all and half of her room was open to the rest of the house. As for Kevin he got kicked ouf the house for beating George. Of course my father wasn’t the one that decided that. Agatha was the one who intervened, she never liked Kevin and I don’t blame her for that. She convinced my father and Kevin went back to where we used to live.

Agatha tried to leave him once when I was in uni. He threatened her using her children and pointing out everything that made her insecure. He also convinced her to not let the girls go to school anymore. He would spend his days watching tv, hating on women, gay people and asians. Agatha had a job that was far away from the house. He wouldn’t clean the house at all, and would wait until she came back to pick a fight with her over anything he could. The house was so dirty that worms would come out from the shower.

After I was admitted to uni, everything became more bearable since I was out of the house, away from all the toxic environment. I was struggling very hard with depression, agoraphobia, anemia and anorexia. COVID made it worse and my father forced me to go back home. I was blocked there for 6 months and those were the worst 6 months of my entire life. I have a panic attack every time it’s mentionned. It was constant yelling, stuff thrown around in the house, no care for my little sisters, constantly blaming us for anything. Thankfully for my bestfriend and his parents who allowed me to stay an entire month with them after all of that.

But I urgently needed to get away from Agatha and my father, I took the first job that I found and escape from their grasp. I worked for 2 years before quitting and I am now living with my mother. I’m seeing a therapist and multiple doctors, I learned th	at I have endometriosis, I’m getting treated for all of my problems. For the first time in my life I’m able to sleep more than 4h. My health problems were finally taken seriously. Of course I’m not fully healed, but through my therapy sessions, I realised that I was abused. That’s the first thing my therapist told me. I was abused and I need to accept it and move on. And I’ve come to the conclusion that writing all of this down and publishing it would be a great step into aknowledging my suffering.  

I obviously changed the names, and I didn’t talk about everything because it would be way much longer. Thank you for reading all of it"
"When I was 8 or 9, my mother had started to forcefully wax my pubic hair through Brazilian waxing. I wasn’t allowed to say no. I lived in the middle east and it was seen as dirty for girls to have hair down there. My mom thought she was doing me a favor by starting earlier because the hair would never grow as strong then (she was wrong). It hurt so incredibly bad. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. All my aunts knew about this. 

When I was 11 I started doing it myself but it took me hours and my momwould tell me that she should do it for me because I never successfully removed every single hair according to her. So I was forced to get my pubic hair removed from her nearly every two or 3 months till the age of 13. It stopped when I was 14 and I was getting a Brazilian wax by a salon lady. I couldn’t do it and finally put up a fight and came out crying in the middle. We moved to the US afterwards and she just let me do what I wanted to groom my hair. She mentioned a few times that I should get a Brazilian laser and I refused. I am 16 now. She doesn’t do any such things to me anymore. I didn’t know what happened to me was weird until last year. But now whenever I think about it I feel like throwing up.

I recently got a PTSD diagnosis because of the sexual trauma this (and a few other CSA incidents) caused me but I fear fully disclosing this to a therapist would cause the the therapist to call CPS. I don’t have a green card since I moved here two years ago so I rely on my mother for money/transport etc. I don’t want to “rat” her out but I just don’t feel safe in my body anymore. My latest therapist appointment is on the 28th. I don’t know what to do before that…"
"I am physically disabled and in a wheelchair, ventilator, oxygen, feeding tube and I have round the clock nurses and caregivers. I was going to go to the abilities expo this Sunday in Los Angeles with my dad and sister but mom was going to go to her singing event she wasn’t available from the start and then dad said he would go with me. Now he’s yelling at me and complaining about how he wishes he can do gardening or something he enjoys and not spend his time going there for what ? Well what about being a supportive parent? Is that too much to ask? But I suspected this. He’s verbally abusive and doesn’t care in general so. I thought that sometimes it was good experiences that it wasn’t all bad but now more and more I’m seeing times when they’ve let me down. I’m sad. I wish I had supportive parents and not neglecting and abusive ones. I’m 31. I swear if I didn’t have round the clock nursing and caregivers I wouldn’t be ok. I wish so badly I can move out of here I’m slowly dying emotionally living in this toxic place."

TW BRIEF MENTION OF SA AND PHYSICAL ABUSE 



So my mom was contacted by the county in January because she's a hoarder. She got so much worse after I moved out. Some of the things she's done in this situation: Made herself ""fall"" the day before I moved so I would stay home and be her slave. Tried to force me to be her caregiver by tattling to the social worker. She's also still been ordering stuff and it piles up. Yesterday I was over to help the county clean out the house. One room took up almost an entire pod sized dumpster. Obviously she is not of sound mind and needs mental help. I want to keep things at a distance for other things she has done to me, but in my opinion she needs mental health issued by the court. I spoke to the case worker this morning about possibly getting the court involved, but said since she seemed mentally sound that they likely won't rule in my favor. 

For further context, I am not refusing to be her caregiver for no reason. When I was a child, she physically and sexually abused me, and I feel like this is a potential attempt to try and abuse me again, or to keep me trapped in her house of horrors. Being a caregiver requires the person caring for an individual to help toilet or shower. I refuse to put myself in a situation that could lead to being abused again. "
"My parents got a divorce just before Covid hit because my dad was constantly fighting with my mom and now that they are divorced my dad constantly yells at me (14f) and my brother (10m).
I just can’t deal with it anymore because if I mess up  or forget something he starts screaming things like “you useless bitch” “bastard” “fucking grow up” “fucking spastic” “fat cunt” “prick” “lazy fucking cunt” and to add to all that he’s racist, sexist, anti-vaxxer, homophobic. Because of my father calling me things like a “fat bitch” I now hate my body and don’t eat for a day then I binge eat and try to throw up after. When he starts yelling I get scared that he will hurt me though he has never physically hurt me. After arguing with me or my brother he comes through and says “you know I only yell because I care about you”. Another thing he does is he says horrible untrue things about my mom to my brother like she was and is a drunk ( which she is not) and whenever I put on noise cancelling headphones to try and escape his yelling he just calls me “autistic” or if I hid under my blanket he says “laying in your bed all day you lazy bitch”. The only reason I live with my dad is because of where my school is and I want to tell my mom about how sad, depressed and scared I am but I’m really scared to. It doesn’t help that everyone in our town thinks he is a good guy and a great single parent because that’s how he presents himself and they all believe my mom is the abusive person. I just wish I could live with my mom because she would never say these things to me or act like this. I just don’t know what to do or who to talk to and I keep missing days of school because i just feel so depressed and anxious. Help please what should I do?

"24F (me) 50F (mom)

So my mom has been abusing me my whole life and it's not secret. She's always taught me what to say when CPS came and how to protect her. About a year ago I had called the cops cuz she had bitten my face during a physical altercation we had. At that time, I had just had knee surgery and had just gotten off probation for a DUI and for two assault charges when I found my ex fiance sleeping with my friend. One of the assault charges had gotten dismissed and the other lowered to a ticket...  but I knew I had to stay out of trouble so I called the cops. By the time the cops got there my mom had called my dad and the situation was worked out so I tried to protect her by telling them we had worked it out. On the other hand my mom was telling them I was on drugs and I was the aggressor when that wasn't the truth and I was on crutches and could barely walk at the time. They believed her and I got the ticket and had to go back to court. My mom eventually dropped the charges and told me that if I called the cops again she would do it again. I felt betrayed because she had taught me my whole life to protect her but when the moment boiled down to it , she was gonna throw me under the bus to protect herself! So fast forward to this past week. Me and my mom had gotten into an altercation and she chased me with an extension chord hitting me and threatened to shoot me so I called the cops. I remembered what happened last time so I told them the truth and she got arrested. My mom is extremely angry with me and withholding the car from me and it's taken a toll on how I get to work. I found out today through a detective that the state is going to pursue charges but I can go to the district attorney's office and sign an affidavit to have the state drop the charges. At first, I was willing to run down there and sign the affidavit because I do love my mom very much and when times aren't bad they're good. However, I realized her fate was now in my hands and I can choose not to sign the affidavit if she doesn't let me have the car back. Is this morally wrong? Or is it smart? Also how would you handle this situation?"
"I’ll start this out by saying I barely post on Reddit so if this is formatted weirdly I’m sorry.

 I’m a student [F17] residing in the uk who wants to go to university. My childhood has never been great. I can’t go into detail but my mother used to be abusive physically and mentally but now I’ve grown bigger than her it’s only mentally. It is so bad I suddenly break down crying a lot. I have always wanted to study film production, it is my first dream I’ve had the confidence to have other than the dream of being loved. 

But the thing is my parents won’t let me go to university. They want to be in control of me and my sister so we are not allowed to be anywhere that’s further than a 40 minute ride in the car. We live in the country side. At first I thought the reason was the distance but my mother keeps saying no to every single university which makes me think she doesn’t want me to go at all. 

Since I’m turning 18 soon I know you will say that I don’t need to listen to them. But I can’t. I really can’t. When I was a child they never let me out the house so I find social interactions hard. I was stuck in my house all my life so my parents are my life and I can’t just leave my life especially when I know they aren’t really bad people it’s just they are bad parents. They hide my legal documents from me. I’m not allowed a job I’m not allowed to get a drivers license. I have no friends to couch surf. I have a tracker that I can’t turn off otherwise they will tell me off.  I NEED TO NOTE THAT MY PARENTS KEEP SECURITY CAMERAS ON EVERY POINT OF THE HOUSE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. I actually have a fear of cameras watching me at all times because of the amount of cameras there are. I get panic attacks because of this sometimes.

Money is a big issue. I have been on a revolut junior debit card up until LAST YEAR. It was only when I changed cards that I got an adult debit card (I secretly got the adult one and had to act shocked when my parents saw it wasn’t a junior one.) My parents do not let me have a job I have no way to even hide having one. I have no weekly allowance. They give me money when I want to go out (when I was 15 I convinced them to let me go outside for fun.) I have started to save this cash in my account but I’ve only started this year since my parents can no longer see my balance since I’m not on a junior card anymore. When I had a junior card they used to track what I bought and where and also took money out of my account if I had too much in there (more than £20). 

My family is pretty well off. For context we have two cars (a Volvo and a Tesla), a million pound house, multiple gym equipment, a sauna and surveillance everywhere. They keep saying they cannot afford my accommodation to shut me up. I told them I would get a student loan they said that would do nothing. I am not eligible for a student loan because of my family’s income I’m pretty sure and my family keeps pushing it into my head that a student loan will not pay for accommodation.

My older sister is at uni but she is the favourite child. We constantly fight for my parents love which makes her snitch on any little thing I do (they take my sisters side no matter what.) However my sister  wanted to go to a really good uni but couldn’t because it was too far from them (it was really close to my aunts but my parents said they needed to be close to them). My sister had to settle at an average uni. 

Even though it sounds like my parents are too controlling, they actually barely do their parental duties. Since I was little I’ve had the understanding that I had to be my own parent. That I had to cook for my self, that I had to teach myself things that others knew from simply growing up in a healthy household. I’ve played board games by myself more than I can count, I packed my school lunch since I was shorter than the kitchen counter, I taught myself how to do most things. 

I don’t know if this will help with anything but my body isn’t healthy. Other than my health problems that I doubt I will live past 20 with, I also have a lot of other “problems”.

I am diagnosed with autism, adhd, dyspraxia. 

I think I might be a bit histrionic because of my childhood trauma.

Anyways, I just need advice so I can get out of my situation. I really want to go to university. I really need someone who has been in my situation to guide me. I don’t think I can continue acting like my own parent anymore. I want a rest. My heart needs a rest. Please respond even if it’s just telling me that you made it out of your household because maybe it would give me some hope.

"I don't remember a lot of things but I'll try my best to recount everything.

I was put into the system at a year and a half years old. I was told that I went to 14 different homes. I don't remember any of that. My parents would always say that they were these perfect parents and that without them I wouldn't be where I am. They constantly belittle me and rarely praise me. They say they can't trust me because of how I behaved when I was younger yet I don't remember any of it. When I turned 18 it just got worse. My parents would threaten to kick me out instead of the house and unadopt me. Most of what I did was heavily restricted and monitored. There was a point where I had to shower with the door open because they ""couldn't trust me"" I never got access to my bank account nor any of the identification documents. I could never have friends over or hang out with friends. I never got access to my medical information until a couple of weeks ago. I know that my parents are financially abusive. That's not even a question. I sometimes question my own choices because I am scared of disappointing my parents. 

I'm trying to cut them off but I can't right now because I won't be able to support myself without them."
"My mom has always abused me. There has never been a day i can remember that she hasn't abused me she doesnt abuse my siblings only me . My friends know that i get abused, and they are trying to get me to get help, but i dont know what to do, and i am scared to get help. My dad has a new girlfriend and doesn't care about me he only cares about my siblings. I have developed an e.d and have attempted 2 times just because of my mom. My mom is a rascist towards me and calls me fat. I really need someone to give me some advice because i dont know what to do"
So the bones in my legs are litterally fused wrong but whenever my feet were in the wrong spot he would kick and stomp my feet in so tired of everything 
"My mom is really abusive, she’s really controlling as well. There’s things she does that are horrible and unkind, she tells me all the time how much of a burden I am for my medical issues. She complains on how much time she has to take off work for those appointments, but everything is written on my page. "
My abusive father still has my social security card and birth certificate. I have lived on my own for 4 years and it has never been an issue until now. I have asked to have them mailed to me but he has just ignored me. I am about to cut my loses and just but a new BC. I am getting married in May so i will be getting a new SSC soon anyway. But i was wondering if anyone knew if it is illegal for them to withhold these documents from me? I live in Wyoming and cannot find much info on google. Thank you for any help <3 
"My dad is awful. Ever since I was little, my dad has treated me rudely. He once got mad at me for telling my grandma that he called her a bitch behind her back. I thought I was doing the right thing and all he had to say was ""look at her she's smirking"" I was just a kid. He never apologizes or admits when he's wrong. One Christmas he just up and left our family because he was mad. It got to a point where my parents fought so much that my dad asked me if I wanted to move out with him even though once again, I was a kid. He makes everyone ""tip toe"" around his feelings. He has inappropriately touched my ass multiple times even though I told him I didn't like it, and my mom doesn't even believe me. He used to take the straps of my bra and snap them across my back. He has made sexual gestures at me with his crotch by moving his penis around. As a kid, he used to get angry at me if I didn't say hi to him the first thing as he walked through the door. He constantly tells me that I don't love him without me even having the chance to speak. He constantly ruins our plans. He told me ""don't start"" when I said me and my mom wanted to stay a bit longer at an event and then suggested to my mom that him and her should go by themselves because ""she hadn't had the chance to look around enough"" (he literally made us leave the event). My dad always tells me that I don't do nothing for him which I have decided not to due to the way he treats me (I feel uncomfortable doing anything for him because of how he acts). He always gets worried that my mom cheats on him while he's not home (this is not the case). As a kid, he has called me a clown or a bitch. Constantly he ""play fights"" with me to the point where he actually hurts me. I tell him it hurts but he doesn't believe me and gets mad at me. All of this has greatly affected me and I now have ocd where everytime I think of him, I have to do a compulsion to get rid of the thought. I don't know if this is considered trauma but I wanted to ask someone to see if I'm overexaggerating. I just want to know for my own peace of mind."
"I confronted my mother for the first time and told her that she is the culprit not the victim
I feel like I am on the top of world, I don't really like to be the mean girl and I probably won't do it again, as it will change nothing, but I am somewhat happy that I managed to say what I am thinking for once."

"9.3.24 Saturday-

Paul's birthday(my stepdad). I was stood in the way of the door and the cupboard in front of paul while he was reading his cards. Jennifer then puts her hands on both my shoulders. I thought she was trying to move me out the way of the door so I try to move forwards out her way but she still kept ahold of me so i try to move backwards out the door because i still didn't know where she wanted me to go. She then got angry and started shouting about how she was just trying to turn me around slightly to get into the cupboard discreetly to get Paul's birthday cake. How was I meant to know that that's what she was trying to do? Then Jennifer starts shouting about how it all boils down to the fact that i don't like to be touched. All of us where in the kitchen as well as Jennifer having a raised voice at me so I raised my voice. Not to be directly disrespectful but so I could be heard. She then shouts at me not to shouting at her. I went to respond that she's shouting at me and I was trying to get her to hear me. But before i could finish what i was saying Jennifer grabs me by the crease in my arm and drags me out the kitchen and screams at me to go upstairs to my room. When I went back upstairs my arm was red and covered in scratch marks where her nails and scratched me while dragging me. I was then told later that night by Paul that I need to watch what I say, think before I speak and ""that is your mother""

10.3.24 Sunday-

It was after half five because they where watching the football. I came down and asked Jennifer and Paul what we were having for dinner. I asked if we were having the pies in the fridge because I heard Jennifer say that they where going out of date and needed to be ate. And then Jennifer and Paul starting moaning at me that because I'd spent £14 in tescos the day before on veg and other stuff for lunches and to go with dinners ect that I should be having them. She expected me to have veg with cut up smoked sausage, the chicken bits I bought for pasta and veg for my dinner. Then she said that i should take some of the pastas i made for lunch for the week and take some out of each and have that even though it's meant ro be my packed lunches for the week. She then went on about why do I need to have anything I the pasta? Meaning why can't you just have the pasta and the sauce. I went back upstairs and around an hour later I came back down and asked if we where still going to see Paul's cousins wife on hospice on the Monday night after work and school because I was asked if I was able to go out by a friend and wanted to make sure that I wasn't still busy because nothing had been said about it in awhile. I asked and Jennifer said that it doesn't look like we're going. Paul joined in and said he could get in touch with his cousin but 'it doesn't matter anymore' since I've already got plans. And i said to go without me then and he asked what the while reason is that we're going. Id added in while he was saying that that i really didn't want to go to a hospice again because its a horrible feeling sitting there while someones dying. I answered paul by saying that it was to see his cousins wife. Apparently I was already told by Jennifer and supposedly Paul as well that the plan was that me and Emmy where going to walk to the chippy with Sarah-Louise(his cousins daughter). I remember me, Jennifer and Emmy talking about his cousins daughter and that she was ginger but paul definitely wasn't there and no chippy was mentioned. I said that that must've been to Emmy because it wasn't to me. I got really upset so I started to walk up the stairs. Jennifer stopped me and said that i better hope my gran Janet doesn't end up in hospice because i won't be going to see her. I turned back around and it started again and all said it was different if it was my family but I don't want to have to sit in a hospice again if I don't have too. 

11.3.24 Monday-

I came downstairs to get stuff sorted to leave for work Monday morning and I reminded Jennifer that I was going out with my friend then going to grandas to stay tonight. I thought everything was fine and she asked why, I said why not and she responded why aye? I hadn't answered her because I was filling my water bottle up at the sink and then she just started shouting and screaming at me that was ignorant and other stuff and I'd asked what I'd done. She asked why it is that I'm going to stay with granda tonight and not Tuesday(i have a group tuesday night that doesn't finish til nine at night and it takes me around an hour to get home)  i said that it was because granda doesn't work tuesdays and that he'll still be home when i wake up for work. I went and grabbed packed lunch for two days and I have no clue if she was just acting stupid or just thought, without me actually saying it, that I wasn't going because she asked me why I'd grabbed two tubs of pasta. I said it was because I was staying out and wouldn't be home to get it? She kept going on about how me and her and spoke about this and how I should stay with my granda so that I'm not out too late. We had spoke about it but not set plans, all she said is that ""maybe it's a good idea"" which I would agree with if I wasn't going to wake up to an empty house in my grandas. She hasn't even thought that my granda might not want me staying there on a work night for him either but apparently I only think about myself. I had to leave so i walked towards the door saying I needed to go. She scoffs, clearly angry that I'm not going to sit there and listen to her crap. She walks over and opens the door for me and tells me to get out so I walk towards the door and as soon as im close enough she pushes me out and slams the door so hard that the letter box NEXT to the door rattles I go to walk up the street and she opens it again and says that I've not to bother staying with granda because she doesn't want me to taking that attitude to her father's. She was shouting this at me in the middle of the street. Again, angry that I didn't entertain her and just kept walking she started texting me saying the exact same thing and says I've to take it to my gran janets."
"my parents have been having sex next to me since I was little the only reason I would sleep next to them is because I was scared of the dark when i grew older i started to sleep in my room, but now my parents decided to move to a one room apartment until we move to a house. We been staying here for over a week and since the first day i felt uncomfortable since the trauma i had with them when i was little. let me add to this that my mom is mentally abusing me my whole life and projects her self on me. She’s also had mental issues which is seems to be a genetic since my grandma have if they both act crazy. The last 2 days we were staying at the apartment my mom started to be sexual with my dad infront of me and even say sexual stuff around me be naked and stuff like that. I got tired of it so i decided to record them to have proof of everything they were doing infront of me since i want to reach out to one of her sisters to see if they would say something to my parents. She didn’t she’s always been on my mom side on everything she doesn’t care basically. So i decided to text my mom and tel her how i knew she was having sex infront of me and how’s she been doing that infront of me and that she can’t deny it since i had proof. She called my disgusting and crazy. I don’t understand how in the crazy one when she doing all of this infront of her child. My whole life she has always made me look like a lier and bad to her sisters."
"Hello. I need advice. Sorry if I’m in the wrong thread but I decided to post here anyway. 

Here’s some context:

Right now I’m struggling 27 going 28 with adhd, slightly depressed, no college degree, working part time at work and as a student at a community college living with/off my parents. I’ve lived life where I was accidentally hit by my dad who didn’t know his own strength when I got problems or had difficulties understanding problems as a kid and eventually stopped when the youngest was born. I’m used to being told or treated like I’m stupid by both my parents. My siblings who learned from their behavior through their words and actions. I’m told I should give up going to college. I was the scapegoat in the family. Everything I did was wrong or could be criticized. They’d say shit like: my personality was bad or I would lose all my friends due to my character whenever I tried to argue or fight back. I was always the defensive one that argued back whenever I didn’t want to be silent. Everything always felt like it was my fault and I could do nothing but deal with it. My siblings are successful and graduated college, so naturally it’s my fault because they turned out perfectly fine.

It was about 1 year ago when their behavior changed and they decided to be nicer. I assume it was a mixture of a rise of mental health awareness through social media/the internet and my sister’s friend committed suicide due to depression. They would suddenly give me more attention. Buy me food, take me on walks, have pleasant conversations, and just be generally ok or decent (nice even). And it seemed like my dreams came true or the great change I hoped things would be but I could not help but be wary. There were times they acted differently for a week and then revert back. This one was different in that they seemed to care more or put more effort it or it lasted longer than a week.

I questioned them even when they started treating me better due to previous experience. The questions would lead to fights and arguments. From the arguments I learned they didn’t really change in mentality. I was still the crazy stupid one. Nothing was ever their fault and that they did their best. I should just forget or forgive everything. I was the one who wasn’t good enough. I should be thankful I wasn’t killed.

My parents were also abused as children and their abuse was far worse. Since my siblings and they themselves have been successful I should be successful and this it is not their fault. They’re right in a way.

I’m so lost on what to do. What should I do?"
"I am an adult now and am about to move in a couple of months. I have experience driving but have made no progress in the two years I have been technically learning to drive so I am as good as I was when I first touched the wheel. It's been about 5 months now since I tried driving and I want to learn before moving. The last time I drove my mother freaked out and jolted the steering wheel making me almost crash into something because I came within two car lengths of another car even though I was slowed down to at least 10mph and was continuing to slow. I think it was unnecessary and that she overreacted but of course, I was the one that got chewed out and punished for it. It was not the only time something like that happened but it was my last straw.  My dad is very laid back and I actually drive a lot better when he is in the car but mom wants the liberty of being the one to teach me how to drive. I have to suck it up and drive with her because she will not allow me to learn anywhere or from anyone else. Does anyone have any tips on learning with her and or any videos that may help? I have a friend I may be able to ask for help but it's not a guarantee. "

"TW; I don't know who to talk to abt this, Im too afraid to tell anybody because It would make things worse. Me and my brother are both victims of a very narcissistic mother. Im afraid though because what if im overreacting because she constantly tells me she loves me but everyday she is screaming and shouting, hitting and my dad does nothing abt it even though I have tried to tell him so many times on what shes like when he isn't around. Im so exhausted I dont want to constantly make up excuses of why I never go out or why I can never go on my phone. I have had things thrown at me, I have been thrown across rooms. Im so scared of her but love her so much and im so hurt because I dont know who to talk to about it except my brother. Hes younger than me but she has never laid hands on him, I think its partially because he is a boy. I have tried talking to her so many times but she just makes up excuses for her behaviour. She constantly thinks everything I do is because I ""Hate her."" and am ""Out to get her."" She believes everything I do is out of spite to annoy her and I cant deal with walking on eggshells anymore. I have taken 2 overd0ses which both failed but its because It has been so bad at home and at school. I dont know what to do anymore. I am so miserable and I cant live like this please I need advice on what to do. Im 15 and I cant runaway so how do I just endure it?"
"the title is pretty self-explanatory, but i just tried to off myself and i thought that maybe i should leave something before I go, let everyone know why i did what I did. 

this is not going to be gramatically correct at all, because im shaking a lot lol.

i dont know how to start this off, but yeah, I just got thrown into my room without any dinner. ive been debating writing a post on here for a little while. Me and my twin brother got into a fight and he pulled a knife and started threatening me, so i locked my door and called my mom. shes on a business trip so she couldn't do anything, i want to tell her its not her fault. after my dad thrown into my room, i looked up ""Signs of Abuse"" and i read through the whole thing, afterwards i broke down. My dad took away my phone so i cant call my therapist or anyone and im writing this on a 15 year old laptop. I cant even get my dog, i can only wallow in self-pity. I have school tomorrow and i dont know what to do anymore, i cant go out of my room to shower or grab my backpack either. and ive talked about this with my mom, my dad used to hit me and my brother when she wasn't home or on a business trip, she said she didn't remember. I told her that I couldn't live like this anymore and she tried to talk with my dad and things got better for a little while. but its going back to how things were and im done, i cant anymore. so this is my goodbye, I know im being a bitch, and being selfish but i just can't anymore."
"I think I might know the answer, but it's just not good enough for me.
I believe it could be 1 of 2 things.
1. Me & my brother have different dad's, I think she possibly disliked my dad more than his dad, and took it out on me?
2. My mom thinks men are ""just better"" than women, and I know she treats men better.
I went through utterly horrific abuse from my mom, verbal and physical, and what did my brother get? Oh, anything he pleased. And he was such a demonic little child- he would kick my knee caps, then run to my mom and said that I hit him, just so she would beat me. It's mother fucking fucked up. I wonder why this happened to me? It's been years and I still fucking hate my mom and my brother for it. I was an ANGEL daughter - I didn't do drugs, drink alcohol, smoke, none of that. I didn't even have boyfriends because I was a lesbian ( out of all things she was okay with that). So why beat ME? Fast forward to now, my brother is a total degenerate, burn out LOSER. Epitome of failure. Smokes drinks and does drugs. He quit his first job after his first day, and my mom continues to ""believe"" in him. Meanwhile I got a degree, certifications, and my own business and I still don't think she sees me as fucking successful. I'll always carry this hate around with me."
"(Before you say something about pregnancy i have an IUD which my parents are aware of) I 17 year old (f) almost 18 years old am in college and have been for almost a year and my parents refuse to treat me like an adult. Recently, I have had the option to choose my dorm for next year and decided to become roomates with my boyfriend of at the time of moving in will be 2 years with him. 

when i told my parents they absolutely freaked out and said they do not approve and said i have to get permission. mind you my parents said i can sleepover at my boyfriends house and do whatever i want when i turn 18. btw my boyfriends mom doesn’t care cuz we are legal age and my mom tried to use that argument and when i said his mom didn’t care she dropped that argument and made other one…

The reason why i wanted to dorm with my boyfriend is because we would be dorming in the same building anyways and i have to save money as i will be paying for my housing plus i dont want to live with strangers and thats my only other option. I tried explaining this to my parents but they kept saying no. when i asked why they brought up my grades. i stated that i have a 90 and higher in almost every class and i’m with my boyfriend all the time anyways so that doesn’t make sense then they kept bringing up other arguments and wouldn’t give a valid excuse.

I tried asking my parents to hear out my side and talk to me as an adult rather than a kid if they want me to act like an adult. I asked them to stop shutting me down and at least try to listen to me and my mom said no. she said she doesn’t want me to take on this responsibility but i’ve already taken on this “responsibility” because i hang out at his dorm all the time and sleep there with my parents knowing. There is a lot of other stuff that i can include in just didn’t want my post to be long. let me know what you think though please and if you want more. 

Is this toxic? what do you think is this relationship dynamic with my parents? Sorry for the long read!"
"If you had an accident and suffered from amnesia regarding your traumatic childhood, would you want someone to remind you of what your parents did to you before your amnesia or would you prefer not knowing about the past and being able to build a completely new relationship with your parents? "
"Me F(22) and my sister F(25) moved in my with dad after living with my abuse mother and her husband - bit of background. My step father sexually abused both me and my sister at young ages , he was aggressive , would hit us and my mother and there was levels of neglect as well and it ended up getting took to court. For me leaving my mother at 12 years old after all this was hard for me, I still missed her and pined for her love and affection but after the court case I never seen or spoke to her since, because she took her husbands side. So it's been 10 years and I genuinely hate Mother's Day, I usually just like to spend it with me and my sister. When I was younger I used to make mothers days cards, score out the mother and put Father then give it to my dad and he loved this (can I also add my dad is an extreme level of narcissists) however as the years went on and I got older I grew out of doing that for my dad and it just became more of a day for me to genuinely try ignore everything related to Mother's Day. ( my sister still tends to buy him a Mother's Day card and put both our names on it but I don't bother and she only does it to keep him happy because any other year on Mother's Day when he hasn't received any kind of recognition he tends to make snide comments and go in a mood) he is of the impression that he is intitled to Mother's Day and Father's Day because everything he's done for us ( he done bare minimum and thinks me and my sister should be grateful as he took us off my mum when he didn't need to, he often says things like ""I could have easily of lefts yous there, I didn't need to take yous in"" 


Anyway my sister is 5 days into a new breakup and she was with her boyfriend for 7 years so she isn't taking it well and she's struggling and on top of that it's Mother's Day so she feels awful. She gave him his Mother's Day card and he made a comment ""is that all I got"" and then proceeded to ask her to go see my gran with him , however she's really not in the mood and is struggling mentally , plus sitting in my grans house is just another reminder that we don't have a mum. My sister replied to my dad ""no"" and he took the huff , slammed the front door and left the house and has turned his phone off so we can't contact him 


Please tell me someone agree that the level of selfishness coming from him is absolutely not acceptable. On a day of all days when me and my sister struggle as well as her dying of heart break he is acting this way 


Oh and my sister have really bad anxiety due my dad has his unpredictable narcissistic behavior and he knows this as he's acknowledging that she's an anxious person because of him , so he knows by leaving the house the way he did and turning his phone off will send my sister into a spiral "
"I think I'm genuinely starting to resent my mom. For the second time in the past few weeks she's accused me of doing something wrong. The first time I was up late playing a game on my phone since I was off work the next day. The second time, tonight, while I'm trying to sleep, she claimed she heard loud noises from my room and call me on the phone to say God is watching me and Satan is busy. Then I started hitting myself out of anger and frustration and she said those are the same noises she heard earlier. Usually I'd tearfully talk to her about it but I'm sick of this fucking cycle. She's making me hate her and religion. Talking to her and crying make me feel better, but I'm sick of talking to her and I can't seem to cry now. I got my blade and almost cut something so that at least the blood would feel like a tear but I just decided to post here. "
"My dad has been well established to be at the very least emotionally toxic/abusive by my therapist, who even came out and told him ""You need to figure out if you care more about having a relationship with your daughter or having her follow your every rule"" 

That hasn't done much since he hasn't really changed, but there's something I used to think was normal that I recently started realising might not be. 

I'm not allowed to eat apart from certain time frames. And I'm not talking about ""No food after 10pm"" kind of stuff. If I'm not awake and eating by 9.30am (yes on the weekend) I'm not allowed to eat until lunch. If I have a snack I have to hide it from him or he'll start going on about how fat and unhealthy I am (I'm 52kg, 158cm, 17 years old female). 

My mom says it's insane as a rule, alongside a bunch of other rules of his like no napping on the couch, no being in bed apart from sleeping, no having dark clothes on the couch, no sport clothes to go out, and some more stuff.

I always thought it was normal to not be allowed to eat unless you wake up before a certain time, but more and more people have started telling me it's not and I should be allowed to eat when I want (with healthy boundaries of course).

Is it truly abnormal? Does it count as abuse? I don't know if it's just a strict parenting thing or if it's another toxic/abusive trait my dad has."
"I wanted to go to college but I can't because I need my parents taxes because I live under them but both of them have to agree my stepdad doesn't want to help me. If they don't help me, my family will be in chaos, because my stepdad recently been to the hospital, and if he didn't go there, he would've died. Then the house, the cars, the insurance will be over my head and my siblings are too young to do anything.
My mother is pregnant. Not to mention my stepdad owed somebody $3000."
"Since I was little i remember my mom being loving and caring but once i grew up everything changed. For what i remember my mom would always call me thing you shouldn’t say to your child like “you’re  so dumb”, “you’re not good for nothing”, “your cousin is so much better than you” or would compare me with the rest of the girls at my school. At some point she started to hit me just for a simple mistake I would make I remember seeing the mark of her hand on me all red. I would beg her to stop and to treat me better but she would look at me and smile like she wanted to laught she never cared about what i was saying and until this day she still doesn’t. One day I was asked if Inwanted to move the the United States I said yes it was my dream at that time. When i started school I was doing okay until I was being sexualise by this 2 boys in my class I was never thought about being sexuallied so the next day my paresnt were going to drop me at school in the morning and I told them ai didn’t want to go they asked me why i said i was being bulllied by this 2 boys in my class. My school never believed me and the friend if this 2 boys were defending them. at that time me and this kids we were 10 years old and these kids and their friends were acting like 18 years talking to grown men and women and sexual stuff because I wasn’t like them Inwas called immature i didn’t understand why so this made me really depressed to the point i wouldn’t want to go to school and wanted to die. My parents would scream at me and be mad at me in the morning because i didn’t want to go to sxhool. I still would stay and each morning mh mom would go out to the store and my dad to work every time they were gone I would go downstairs and get a knife to kms but i was never able to so I would  try the next day. One day i didn’t notice my mom was home and i did the same routine as always get the knife my mom went downstairs and she was going to make breakfast but she noticed the knife was going she went into my room and asked me if I had it I said yes bc i trusted her and thought she would help me and listened to me but no she closed the door so hard and she went downstairs i heard her talking on the phone with someone then the police came they took the knife and told me to change Inwas asking if i was going to be lock in a kids jail for crazy kids like my mom would always tell me because she thought I was crazy like my grandma ( her mom) who has mental problems. Then an ambulance came ans took me to the mental hospital. There was this woman she was the translator and I still remember who means and rude she was worn me. She asked me questions about what was going on and let my parents stay in the room but when she was going to ask them what was happening she took them out of the room but forgot to close the door completely and i could hear my mom saying I wanted to harm her with the knife. This was very traumatizing because i told the doctors it wasn’t truth and they all scream at me that If I dojt change they would look me in for ever so i stayed quiet and we went back home after that I remember asking my parents to send me back with my grandpa they never did they would shut me down. then in 7 grade i was actually started to get bullied and I would tell my paresnr but never believed me in each class my classmates would call me names and the teachers would never do anything. in 8 grade a girl wanted to fight me because I was supposedly talking bad about her which I never did I barely even knew her. after the day the girl wanted to fight me i didn’t go to school and my mom was so mad at me. She was saying Inwas stupid and just like my grandma once again I remember telling her if you hate me so much why did you have me she said “If i knew you were goig to be like this I wouldn’t have you.” In 9th grade I keep getting bullied I would try to ignore it but in every class was the same thing mostly in art class the teacher was so mean to me. I went to the counselor so they would change my class and I told them why they didn’t care and didn’t change it. So i had to beg my mom to go to school so they would she got tired and finally decided to go. I beg her to change me to another school and she said no until covid started and we moved to another town she finally changed me off schools because the school had email her that Inwas out of the town and I couldn’t be there. I remember her telling me it was my fault from how many problems I had bring and so many absences. When she stayed to change me from school I told her I wanted to do online she would look at me with so much hate and said no we had a fight about it and she just change to this school were they actually cared and let me stay in one room for all my classes but no it didn’t stop there. When it was covid these school made go to school will in quarantine Inwas till adfraid i Would get bullied i remember telling my mom i didn’t want to go and she just drop me at the door and i followed her crying that i didn’t want to and she went and lock her self in the car i was crying telling her to open the door and she said do you want me to call the police look they are right there and started laughing. I was scared and I was wondering why she would do that since i’m still traumatized. I had to call mh dad and tell him what was going on and he called my mom to open the door for me. On the way home she was saying so much negative stuff about me. after a few years later My mom started to see and hear thing that aren’t there over those years we became closer besy friend basically she came to my room once and told me cal the police bc i can’t infront of your dad please” I said why she said because there’s people outside screaming at use that they want to murder us and i want the police so they can take us out of here I said that the police wouldn’t remove them from the house to somewhere safe. Then she would make stay at hotels with her because she was scared of people trying to hurt us she did this while I just had my appendix removed. once we came back home she asked me who was the girl i was talking to I said is this girl I meet on tiktok she asked were she was from I said from Scotland. Now i regret telling her that because now she came up with the fairy tail that mu friend that i’ve been friends with even before all of this is the one that is trying to harm us. I told her that she came up with that after i told her about my friend and it was all a lie and she said yea sure. She told her sister that i give me private information to people that i don’t know which isn’t true. Mh mom was sent to a mental hospital because of all of that. She came out of they’re sooo mad at me for no reason at all. Then she beg mh dad to send her to back to her country with her family he did and so I did because I wanted to see my godparents who actually care and give me the parenting love i should have received. When we went back to our country my mom was doing “better” but my grandma started with stuff blaming my mom for stuff and bothering me so I went off on my grandma for it. My mom went and said I don’t care if you fail your classes but if you keep going line that we are moving to the other house and you won’t have wifi to be able to to your assignments. that’s not all she was started to call my das that stayed in the U.S and she would facetime him and get naked to show him and rub her chest literally next to me and say sexual stuff to him. My aunt for. the U.S came to spend time with us and I wanted to go home so i told my mom and she no you have a suprice coming soon i knew it would be my dad and were we were worn my aunt there’s was only 2 rooms for my aunt and her husband and for me and my mom. I remember crying at night because iKnew my  parents would have intimacy next to me because they have always done that since i was little which has traumatized me and now i feel uncomfortable when they’re together since they sexualize everything infront of me. My mom started to look at me with such a hatred look every time I would talk to her or ask her a question. Since i knew my parents would have sex right next to me I stayed every night when my grandma and during the day with my godmother. My mom came to the room i was staying at my grandmas and she said pack everything because we are leaving and you are not staying here at night I said why didn’t you told me this before I have assignments to do that are due tonight she said pack everything I had to argue with her to let me stay at my grandmas.  She said no i’m going to be waiting for you outside I finished my work and I wanted to stay at my grandma but she wouldn’t let me so i packed everything and i left. with my pateando ti the house we were staying. My mom told me to pack my stuff and while i was doing that i asked her where was my nitendo switch charger and she said in one of those bags I said which one and she said in one of those this was because she was talking. wit her sister in the phone. I kept packing my stuff since she left the room and I thought she would get it and i asked her did you find the charger my mom looked at me with this ugly look on her face and i said why are you looking at me like this since we got here you been looking at me with so much hate she has holding a show and she hold it up as she was going to hit me and said you respect me I said how am i supposed to respect you if you don’t she keep getting closer and i started tk scream how I felt about everything and she started to hit me with the shoe my dad got in the way and stop her at the end my mom said to my aunt “oh is nothing she’s acting crazy just like her grandma is genetics things” That was my last strike with her I have t talk to her and she doesn’t talk to me if she does  it with an attitude and an ugly look. I’m back in america and i want to move back to Puerto Rico but I know my parents won’t let me. I’ve bee so depressed if I tried to reach out for help from family members she goes and says a whole different story and everyone believe her i’m so tired and I don’t want to be here anymore. What should I do? I’m sorry for my english.

"All she does is hate me, anything I do is wrong. I’ve always loved her so much I ruined every opportunity I had for her I stayed at home always for her. Not once did I get appreciated. All I want is my mum…I just want her to hug me and tell me how much she loves me and how thankful she is for me. My boyfriend’s mum hugs me all the time and tells me how much she loves me, but all it does is hurt. It’s not even like I can go to my dad about it because even though he’s not abusive he makes it quite obvious his other kids are his favourites. Maybe if I attempted again it’ll be a good gift for her, then she’ll have her peace and happiness back….love you mum."
"I (17 m) have been thinking about cutting off my family for literal years.

I got told by my father that I should die, I should cut myself deeper and that I am a failure for surviving my suicide attempt. My family doesn't support me because I am transgender and gay, I got told I will never be their son. I got hit by both my parents multiple times. In the end I always end up being blamed, being told that I deserve it. I don't even know if what they do counts as abuse, and as I'm typing this I feel guilty because I don't know if I belong in this subreddit. The only thing, that makes me keep living is the mere thought of being free from this place, and if not for my boyfriend I wouldn't have any hope. I feel like a terrible person for wanting to move out, and never speak to them again.

"me (M17) and my boyfriend (M17, i’ll call him aaron for this) have been together for about a year and a half. we’ve been hiding our relationship the whole time, we’re both closeted and have been saving up money to get away from our homophobic, shitty little town. i come from a big family (im one of six kids) and i’ve been flying under the radar, just the way i planned to. i planned to move away with aaron and eventually just lose touch with my family (they aren’t very good people, homophobia aside, but that’s a different story.)

okay, so cut to yesterday afternoon, me and aaron are in my room (door locked) getting ready to, yknow. i thought we were safe, we’ve done it a shit ton before and never got caught. my mother used to have lock picks for our doors, but my older brother threw them all away while she was out of the house, because he was also sick of her barging into his room. so i truly thought we were safe! but no, she swings open the door to him on top of me, shirts off, with my hand down his pants. we quickly shot away from eachother, but the damage had been done. she gasped so hard it was like she motherfucking inhaled the room.

she left the room. him and i were fucking frozen sitting on my bed. she comes back with my dad. he grabs aaron by the shoulders hard and pulls him up, the whole thing felt like it was going in slow motion. my heart sank to my fucking ass. i thought he was going to attack him or kill him or something. but he just pushed him out of my bedroom door and screamed at him to go home. my dad turned back to look at me. i’ve never been more scared in my entire life. the look he and my mom were giving me is something i will probably never forget. he took my phone (posting this off my school computer) and said he needed to think and that we’d talk later.

i don’t know what the fuck that means but i am terrified. i’m pretty sure conversion therapy is legal here. i’m scared they’ll tell aarons parents (who are also fucking insane. my god.) they don’t really like him in general because they think he’s a “bad influence” (he isn’t a christian and has a lip piercing, and smokes cigs, the horror) 

i didn’t sleep at all last night. i drove to school this morning and just slept in the parking lot all day. i can’t think about anything except this. they’re the type of crazy ass christian’s that say gay/trans people are groomers and need to be in prison/killed or whatever the fuck. do i run away??? i dont want to fuck around and find out what they’ll do. i need to get out of here and take aaron with me. i haven’t been able to talk to him since because i didn’t go into school, but im gonna try and talk to him at his job today. please any advice on how to fucking run away or anything i should do. fuck.

"Not too long ago, my girlfriend’s mom ended up getting sick and we have gone to the doctors. We got the results and it gave us a really big health scare and started to plan for the worst. 
But it had me thinking about my own mom, who I haven’t spoke to for 6 years now. I decided for myself that I couldn’t live my life with her in it. She always cause trouble and put us all in danger with lies and all kind of things. I have been severely abused by her mentally, physically and sexually. Mostly she had other “friends” come over to “play” with me… I know that she knows what happened to me, she took off my dress at a party once, presenting me. This has left me with an extensive list of diagnosis as PTSD, Borderline, heavy anxiety, chronic stress and paranoia (paranoia came after when she started to stalk me). 

But now I’m at a point where I wonder how things will be when she finally actually dies. It’s a sad thing to wish upon someone, but I genuinely believe everyone will live a better life without her. 
But how will I feel? I’ve always said that I have mourned who I wanted her to be. But in the end she is still my mom. I’m so scared of my feelings and how I will cope with it. Will it be just like another day or will I shut down? 

I know you can’t give me answers but I was hoping to hear some other people’s experiences. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this and sorry for my spelling/grammar 🙏🏼

"Like right now I'm having a good Conversation on how much I wish I was a different person as a kid, sence I kind of bullied one kid because I thought he was gay. He hanged with girls and in had a higher pitched voice. He talked about how he did the same to this one shorter kid because he couldn't fight. Kind of wonder what to feel about her m sence he's not the worse. At the worst he's old fashioned and honestly did hit me a couple times in the past, and once said he would laugh if I killed myself. Idk how to feel. Any of you have similar experiences with your parents "
"I understand this seems harsh but I'm desperate and according to semi unclear word of mouth whoever's handling my case will reach a verdict this Monday

I have a history with CPS I was taken from my mother for 2 years when I was too young to remember it which I'm hoping will help my case since I have no documentation of the verbal/psychological abuse my mother puts me through almost daily for background knowledge that may help everyone in my house is addicted to weed and my mom and stepdad also drink daily and do cocaine 

 no they've never gotten physical over it but there's been a few non drug related instances where my parents have gotten physical with me or destroyed things of mine as punishment during an intense argument one day my mom made me take my pants off in front of her because they were hers I walked out my door to my neighbors house to ask for pants and she dragged me back in the house by a chokehold that same day she literally spit in my face, there's been an instance where my stepdads gotten up and pulled my hair forcing my head up to look at him during an argument, there was a time my mother made me kneel on rice holding my arms out straight with several thick books(think dictionaries, school text books so on and so forth) she intended for this to go on for an hour but I only lasted 20 minutes, 

there was a time my mothers thrown my phone down the stairs breaking it entirely, and there's been a few instances where she's popped me in the face my mother is extremely verbally abusive, moody, and controlling she insults me often and throws threats, there's barely food in the house most days I'm not eating, I used to live with my abusive dad until he went to prison I know the abuse he put my mom through is well documented which is something else I'm hoping can help my case and I live with my brother who's over the age of 18 right now who raped me twice when I was 8 but his record was wiped clean because he did some juvie therapy or some shit while he was locked up

has anyone who's been re-placed by CPS lied about something that significantly helped their case? if I have no documentation of the circumstances around me do I have a chance of being taken at all?"
"I am in the process of moving out of my parents house in the next year. I have a narcissistic father who is incredibly controlling, and once I move out, he will definitely cut me off & attempt to sabotage me so I have to move back in.

I am trying to make sure to set up everything I can before hand, to make the transition as easy as it can possibly be.

My car is registered in my name, I will be getting my own car insurance, my health insurance will be provided by my work, and I have my own phone and EZ pass.

I made sure to have my own birth certificate, SS card, passport and other IDs that he may later try to withhold from me.

My car is paid off, and I only have a few months left of my student loans.

What else am I forgetting?

Please let me know what else I should be on the lookout for.

I am also also saving up a significant amount of money - how much should I theoretically have?

"Dear Dad,

I miss you. I think about you all the time. I dream about spending time with you and talking to you, almost every night. I get confused, during the day, because I always feel like I was just with you. They're positive memories. But the version of you in those memories isn't the real you. You haven't treated me like that. You've been absent, self-absorbed, and judgmental my entire life. So when I wake up, I have to remind myself all over again how you really were as a father. But I still miss you. 

I miss those fleeting moments when you would reward me with your attention and praise. I lived for those times. I was like a starving person. You starved me of affection. I believe that you had control of your actions. If you didn't, that's pretty sad. A grown adult who couldn't manage more than a few hours a week with his kid.

To be honest, even when you were with me you often made me feel stupid, or lesser, or insignificant. You were always so critical of little things that didn't matter. You could never correct me as gently as I needed. 

All of that pales in comparison to your actual rudeness, intolerance and cruelty. Screaming at me about gaslighting when you couldn't even articulate what was wrong. Dragging me to a wedding I wasn't even allowed to attend as myself. I disobeyed you the night of the wedding and nothing bad happened because of it, by the way. I told people who I was and they simply accepted me. Something you couldn't comprehend. 

In our last conversation, even after I told you how much you'd hurt me when I tried to come out, you made a joke comparing me to a serial killer. Is that really what you think of me? No wonder I haven't talked to you in years, if that's what you have to offer. 

I really wish I had the father of my dreams, but I don't. I don't even have you because you chose other priorities over treating me with respect. You have officially failed as a father. 

Honestly, it's a miracle I'm even still alive. I owe that all to my partner. You'll never know them. they're everything to me and you dont get to see that. You don't deserve to. I'm going to give all the love I would have given you, to them. 

Your son is dead! Kindly fuck off.

At my job I make roughly 700-780 a week. This week was a really low paying week and I only brought in $500 because I missed a day of work and was late 2 times. My dad hasn’t texted me since Tuesday then shows up with this. For reference the “payment plan” is from last year when he forced me to quit my job. He continued paying car insurance on my car that wasn’t even running and now he wants me to repay him the 10 months on insurance. Long story short. After paying him the $378 and my phone bill $130 I’m now down to $93 to survive for the rest of the week😁. Looks like it’s apple sauce and water all week.

"I'm trying so hard to get out of here because my whole life they've done awful things to me. They don't MEAN to, they're just people who have grown into very bad coping mechanisms and responses and don't know how to take anything without getting defensive rather than trying to not hurt me. 

I'm actively working on getting disability benefits since I'm disabled, and my health declined to the point of not even being able to work 2 days a week (part-time), and because I want to be able to get out of here. I know I'll probably have to live in a single room with a bunch of other people, but if I can leave I can heal.

I'm working so hard, and then my mom gets me some sweets for my birthday, and a laptop desk since I was eyeing one to help with my back while I'm bed-bound.

I've had to lean so hard into coping with my parents that I feel mildly guilty for applying to disability and not wanting to be as chipper and try as much with them as before. 

She got me cake and a laptop thing. My dad was in a good mood and made jokes. That means everything is fine now, my mind tries to tell me, so I can rest and try to just exist here like I have been the past 21 years. 

Until my parents do something else and make me want to just lie down and not wake up all over again. I don't know. When they're nice it makes it harder to justify letting go. "
"My sister struggled with bipolar schizophrenia. We had an abusive mother growing up and my sister was unfortunately the brunt of the abuse for a very long time. She was r*ped, and mol**ted at 3. Eventually she had a mental breakdown and did terrible things to our nieces. She bathed them in her own feces, and tried feeding them her urine. 
My aunt figured all this out and my sister spent 1 year in a mental institution and 1 year in prison. Then my aunt dropped the charges.

Sinse then she’s struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. I cut her out of my life when I was 17. I’m now 24. 
She claims to be medicated and have her life together now, 7 years later. She’s kept this job the longest she ever has and managed to buy a house. 

Problem I am having is ever sense our parents divorced, my alcoholic mother claims that my dad was the abuser and the one that seggually assaulted her. The story doesn’t even add up because my sister is not my dad’s child. And according to the police report dates, my dad wasn’t even living in the same state or country during the assault. He didn’t even know my sister existed until she was 7 years old, long after the assault. But my mother’s brain is nearly fried from her sever alcoholism. 

My sister wants to reconnect. And I want to too, but she cannot get over the idea of my dad hurting her. I know for a fact he didn’t. My mother even told me who it actually was, and then told me she would blame it on my father if he ever left her. 
I want a relationship with her, but there’s absolutely no way I can reconcile with someone who wants to hurt my dad. 
She wants to make a police report even though our state law wouldn’t follow through because it was over 30 years ago. 

Should I just stay no contact, is there ever any chance we could be close with strict boundaries of no talking about our mom or my dad?"
"In my house, it’s just me (15f) and my mom. Last year, my dad (who i get along very well with) had to move for his job, and my older sister went away to college. Living alone with my mom it’s a nightmare. Not a day goes by where she isn’t screaming at me at the top of her lungs for the smallest things. example - If I forget to charge my phone the night before and it’s dead in the morning, I’m stupid, a spoiled brat, I don’t care about my belongings, I don’t deserve anything nice in life, etc. Even when she’s frustrated with herself, she yells to herself so I know that anything I do in that moment will cause her to turn that anger towards me. She doesn’t get physically abusive that often, but whenever she’s yelling, I can tell by her body language she’s holding herself back from hitting me. My dad and sister are aware of this behavior as shes verbally abusive towards them as well, but there’s not a lot they can do as they’re not in the same house anymore. Besides my closest friend, none of my friends know about this and they love her because she acts so friendly/funny around them so I don’t have a lot of people to talk about this with. Every day is so exhausting and over the years it’s gotten to the point where I’m genuinely afraid of her. Pls help."
"I'm curious if anyone else had this rule growing up. In total I have 4 siblings, but growing up it was mainly me and my sister and little brother growing up. Me and my big sister would fight as per norm being the only girls and 2 years apart. My mothers rule was she didn't care who started the fight, the one the was crying would get beat wether from slaps with the hand,belt,or broom stick. We learned from a young age not to tattle on each other and try to handle things ourselves out of fear. Sometimes it would result in us physically fighting. The fights would be so bad because we knew who ever was crying the worst would get beat after even if not in the wrong or the original instigator. We physically faught a lot and even seemed like we hated each other. When the family split we got extremely close and even closer when our mother passed away. Did anyone else have a rule like that? I feel like me and her were pitted against each other in a way. Once again thank you too those that took a stroll down memory lane. I'm sorry for the long read and I'm sorry if I may of triggered a bad memory for anyone here. This is better than therapy tbh♥️"
"So, I'm not sure if this is the right place or not, and it's my first time doing something like this so I hope a mod will lmk if this is the wrong subreddit.

I'm 22 year old male, just call me Asura. Raised in what I guess you could call a modern islamic household. By an Indian father and a Senegalese mother in an upper middle class familly in Europe.

Let me prefice this by saying my dad atleast dod the bare monimus as a parent when it cane to me and my brother. Something he can't even bothered to do for his last two children.

I used to look up to my father, he was always well dressed, well spoken, well mannered and (I thought) well educated. But I know now that wasn't the case. My parents split up when I was around 9 ish? (I can't remember) and my father well spoken as he was poisoned me against my mother at the time. Who one day just took me and my brother and up and left. So at first I saw my mother as the bad guy and it didn't take a lot from my dad to make me hate her. 

She tried, but back then for about 3 to four years I was a real demon to her and any partners she may have had. Constantly fighting, getting in trouble or screaming matches and smashing shit(I have been diagnosed by clinical psychologists to be both lightly bipolar and lightly autisitc apparently). I was young, angry, bullied and confused. And that was used by my father who most likely manipulated me in to hating her by lying about a whole lot of stuff. Because he's a counselor/psychologist and very, very well spoken. (I can't stress this enough.)


But once I moved back with my dad, I started realising he's not the person I thought he was. He never hit me which I honestly would uave preffer over the verbal hour long lashing he gave me and my brother that made me feel like less than dhit. Especially because he meant the world to me but he was so ready to verbally abuse me. Things got even worse when he married his (now after 10 or so years) ex-wife (my ex-stephmother who will be called that bitch from now on.) I was obviously not the favorite as I was given all the chores aside from cooking and actually cleaning the laundry as a 13 year old, I litterally did everything else plus I had to basically babysit my 1 full blood brother (go out to clean his messes) amd my two half brothers as they were born. Aside from dinner and laundry, I basically kept the household running untill I was 18. If I ever got upset about I would be gasslit and litteraly told that this would have been normal if I was a girl. (Coming from a man who has six sons and now 4 broken marriages.)

Over the years I was denied food with a full fridge, plenty of times due to that bitch saying it was for her children and then offering it to guests instead. They were emotionally unavailable to the point I basically raised myself and if I ever told my father anything it was just ammo he would use against me later. He would always present us as a perfect familly but then turn around and abuse all of us. Gasslight and every other form of non physical form of abuse I can think of, my father has called.me every derogative term under the sun. And that bitch has made racist comments about me alongside all the other insults she hurled at me and when I brought it up to him he'd tell me to suck it all up because they are a team. And even that btich will admit mow that living with this man is constantly walking on egshels becuase like a veteran soldier if anyone yells at me or I hear yelling voice I will completely shut done bordering on not functioning anymore. And had no confidence or a positive self image for years because he kept telling me I was an arrogant, egotistical and thankless ungratefull bastard (his actual words to his own 14 year old son.) This is not even going indepth about the vindication as I could write a book about him.

When my full brother moved back to live with our mother again after a short while it became even worse for me. My workload increased all the while being forced to get good grades with the threat of punishment even though I didn't have the time or enery to study. And while he clearly saw I was depressed and doing horribly, decided to guiltrip/gasslight me in to feeling better by comparing my blessed childhood with his( man was kidnapped, insulted and physically abused to the point of landing in the hospital by my grandfather and always at boarding schools back around 1970 ish and the discrimination and stuff was even worse) and told me to suck and up and change right then and there. He'd aslo diminish any accomplishment I ever made by recounting all the ""grandiose"" things he did evem though he has 0 accolades to show for them and would take credit for my achievements as if they were his own. The time I got my next belt in karate he would tell me a Taekwondo grandmaster handed him his blackbelt after only on le training session saiying my achievement is nothing special and then brag to all his friends how I'd made the next level all thanks to him.

Some therapist right?

Anyways it got to the point I started smoking cigarretes and weed to calm down (at around the age of 16) as all of this litteraly went on untill I was 18 and forced to move out while I slept on the street and he went on a holiday to africa I helped pay for. Unable to even finish highschool even though he put such an empahsis on my grades (that were always around 8/10 or higher unless I was particularly bad at a subject.) I wasted my time with nothing for a few mitnhs before finding my own place and strarting a job. It's been about 2.5 to 3 years since I've been living alone and working and finally I'm starting to feel good about myself, but buckle up the worst is yet to come.

Turns out, I was last place to a woman who never gave him any form of affection (I mean this litteraly as she would never ever join us for anything, never kissed or hugged him and only fucked him for the kids.) And he still had two children while in his sixties he back and then and now still admitted to not wanting, saying that even while I was a minor the only reason I wasn't forced to pay rent. (I had a partime job) was because I had all the responsibilities of a parent but none of the disciplinary measures towards my litttle brothers who I basically raised on my own because their parents couldn't be bothered. Meanwhile bragging to everyone he knew I was his pride and joy and the one son that never abandoned me and then in the same breath would switch to tearing me a new asshole in a crowded room filled with strangers in situations where he turned out to be wrong blaming me. Like the time I had to redo a grade or I fought with my brother after he litteraly almost gave me grave bodily damage by jumping on me from about two stories high and lauging it off as a prank.

I tried leaving multiple times but that's when he started treating me as his possession and jailing me to keep me bound to him.

As I lived alone I realised that he was self centered, a hypocrite, a liar, a manipulating narcissist, probably a sociopath, a wife beater (he's beaten both my.mother and that bitch) and a whole host of other things. Example, whilst constantly trying to hammer home I was the precious son that never left him, He'd never listen to a word I said, in serious discussions or otherwise and would even take the word of strangers over my own. Then after years of me basically raising my half brothers (who still don't respect me by the way) couldn't even stand up for me when a stranger planted the idea in that bitches head I was gay and a pedophile and would rape them. (Which I would never, I cleaned their diapers for christs sakes). And now that, that bitch is finally dicorcing him, all the problems I had with her, and he had with her that I contsantly told him about when he ignored my concerns is exactly what he's complaining about. And even though this is his fourth broken marriage, (my dad has six kids, I'm the 3rd, the first one he hasn't seen in 20 years and my elder brother, me and my younger brother don't want to speak to him.) The man isn't even conscientious enough to even bother with self reflection even though his own words and morals he's cheated and abused her. (by having romantic conversation considering courtship with other women, which still counts as infidelity to me and our religion and beating his wife.) Same things he did to my mother by the way.

I could go an on but let me get to the point. Now here's the thing: the reason why nobody has put him in bis place is becuase he's 72 with a serious heart condition and the most stubborn holier than thou self centered asshole you'll ever meet. For a long time I considered airing out my problems like an adult as he constantly urged me to do, especially because he always talk about how he's sorry for what my little brothers have to go through the same post marital war I went through as a kid. Even though he's the instigator of all the abuse. (And I'm talking about the worst things you can imagine, no it's not an exaggeration) and does this in front do a 10 and 8 yeard old that he now can't even be bothered to raise

I don't even want to bother because it's just not worth the energy it would take. Because it's not like he would listen to me anyway. I just don't bother talking to him or reciprocating the affection he tries to show me. I don't even talk to that bitch anymore and refuse to interact with her. Because I'd honestly rather send both of them to the hospital.

 I used to visit my little brothers and be there for them whenever I could, but I'm don't really feel like doing ecause they don't respect me or listen to a single thing I say when I'm trying to be serious with them. And when I go to visit there I'm just emotionally drained and no matter how much I love them, I have to move past and leave them behind in order to live for myself now that I'm finally free of that bastard who birthed me.

So, he's tried telling me I should talk to a therapist but I refuse, after having tried it multiple times for multiple reasons. My father is ironically enough a horribke listener and untrustworthy, CPS and the divorce court never bothered listening to me or even giving me the time of day. And for the most part, all the therapists I have tried talking to just give me the same advice I can see coming from a mile away that's not helping. Talking about doesn't feel like a relief and only brings up old emotions which still kake me short circuit and now that I am finally learning how to he myself it's not because I went to therapy but because I decided to pull myself up by my bootstraps and decided to fix both myself and my life. And ladtly because once again he as a therapist and life coach (Idk what his actualy label is) can not be trusted. And because he said I sh9ukd just change if I was tired of my shitty sotuation I see as seeking mental help as something only a weakling would do.

 Which is also the reason I grew up to be a quiet person that avoids confrontation.

I honestly don't want to either at his point hence the title: Is my dad the abusive bastard I think he is and should I still seek therapy?

Any thougts in general would be apreciated as well.

P.S: I have contact with 5/6 brothers not a lot because we all live in different households with differing schedules and a decent distance away from each other. Including from the 8 and 10 year old who live 5 minutes away on the bicycle. I haven't seen my eldest brother (who's like 40 I think) since I was a baby.

P.P.S: I ended up reconnecting with my mother during years of no contact while I was homeless becuase at my lowest point she showed back up in my life to support me, and I'd say it's thanks to her I'm still alive.

P.P.P.S: Yes, I am aware I have a whole host of mental issues and a lot of skeletons. I still struggle everyday but I am working on them.

And lastly, no I will never forgive him for abusing my mother and hinestly, I feel glad he's suffering as much as he is.

Anyway, that was everything, it ended up being way more than I expected and I'm sorry for the wall of text. For those who are still reading thanks, feel free to comment or reach out to me through DM. It might be a while as I'm not very active on reddit though.

Told my dad I was looking at places and will hopefully have one in the next couple months. Not what I he wanted to hear I guess. Immediately was told to pack and leave.
"So I have a friend who’s parents are physically and mentally abusing her and it’s been getting worse as the years go by,  CPS isn’t doing shit and I’ve tried a lot of hotlines and nothing is seeming to work, she’s been getting extremely suicidal and has even told me she’s gonna run away. I’m really worried and don’t know what to do, please help.🙏 "

Context; I had a boyfriend who was not Mormon and. My parents are Mormon. I am 22 years old. 
"General TW 

This is ment to act as a vent and possibly to get some advice on what to do

My mom throught my life hadn't been the best to me or my siblings, she's mostly just yelled at us for small things and have said things like ""I should just put you in foster care"" or another exaple from just today ""I'm about to start swinging"" meaning she was threatening to hit my sister who is 7, becuase she wasn't getting ready fast enough

I've had to deal with things like this for as far back as I remember, it's gone through ups and downs (mostly during lockdown) and one of the worst ones being in late August 2022

Now this is here I might need some advice. Even in moments like that she always ends up being really nice and often times acts like it didn't happen afterwards. It ends up really playing with my emotions and I don't know how to feel about her.

I don't like being around her and sometimes I am scared of her but at the same time she can be really nice and a good mother. I just really don't know what I should think or do at this point. It's been like this as long as I can remember"
"So idk if you should call this abuse but I think it is, but my dad told me back in March of 2021 that he was gonna use a gag ball on me if I didn’t shut up. Keep in mind I have ADHD it was 10 pm and my meds were wearing off, and I wouldn’t stop talking. I told my mom about it when it happened and she was MAD, but is that a form of abuse? "
"I (22f) reported my parents for physical abuse and neglect against my brothers (8 and 10). I had a lot of evidence, including texts between my parents where they talk about hitting them. I have videos of my dad being very verbally aggressive towards them. They already had another report filed on their behalf by my sisters therapist. I got this text today saying they closed the case. Ive heard this usually means they aren’t going to do anything because they have to keep the case open while they are taking any action against them. My dad is very physically abusive and in my case, he smashed my face, picked me up, and threw me against the wall, and broke my nose at the height of my abuse. I have seen him be physically violent towards my brothers many times, though not to the same extent. I am worried about them and their safety. I don’t know what more I can do because I can’t return home for my own safety. I have also been primarily taking care of them and I do not feel my parents are capable of giving them the care and security they need. I miss them a lot :/ any ideas of what I can do either for myself or my brothers?"
"How do I get my mum to stop drinking profusley?
For reference, My mum has been drinking since I was young and would beat me occasionally and verbally abuse me often. For this reason I flew to another country to leave my Mother and my life behind when I was 8 to live with relatives. 7 years later I moved back in with her thinking that she had changed, yet, less than a year later I am back to getting beaten more and more and her saying stuff like, "" I wish I got an abortion"" and ""I wish you never came back"". She gets heavily drunk every night and always looks for something to yell at me for. I do everything around the house, from washing to taking my siblings to school and cooking every night. But she will always find a way to yell at me. It will start with her saying something sarcastic, then when I ignore her, she will push further and further untill I just snap at her. Then she will go on about how lucky I am to be under her roof and how she could send me to my Father at anytime (I have never met my father or had intrest in it) and then when I say something back it will escelate to her saying she will kill my pets and drown them in a bucket. I cant stop her from doing it and I feel if it goes on any longer I might do something I might regret.
Any advice on how to deal with it?


Update!:
So Yesterday morning I woke up and as it was the easter weekend so everyone is home, I am having a wonderful day until my mother tries to talk to me. She is slurring words and I can tell she is heavily drunk, but I am confused as it was only 9:30 am. Anyways, she starts yelling at me for all of the stuff that I (in her eyes) do wrong, and I have learnt not to argue, but she meantions selling or killing my pets once again. This has tipped me over the edge and I yell back, she pretends to be shocked, Like how could I yell at the person who raised m!? (she raised me till I was 8) and then locks me outside the house. Now I have had enough of her shit, so I call my Nan (her mum) and I tell her whats going on, and my mum walks out and she loses her shit at me. For context she has not had any form of contact in over 12 years so she does not like seeing her son have an actual relationship with his family. Anyways, so she cracks her shit at me and rips the phone out of my hand and smashes it on the ground going on 10 times. Its in half at this point, and she has gotten so worked up that she decided she wanted to hurt me. so she picked up a spirits bottle and thows it straight at my face. It bounces off and smashes all over the ground, she then procedes to pick up a wine bottle and then pelt that at me, this time smashing all over me and leaving me soaking and with cuts over me. She then goes inside and smashes my pc which I custom made with some savings I had. I have no phone, no pc and she has turned the internet off, my only hope was to walk about 15km into town and get a payphone. There I call my Nan and tell her whats happened after she smashed my phone, and we sort some stuff out. I should sometime in the near future be catching a flight back to my nans house and spending the rest of my childhood safe. I have no empathy for my mum anymore, I started this thread saying I cared and wanted to help her. Now I see its useless and if she wants to drink herself to the grave, Idfc, She has no more family left, no more friends left, and hopefully soon no money."

"I've only told this story to those that are close to me. Growing up it wad mainly my mother, older sister(2yr older) and little brother who was autistic and non verbal (20 mths younger) and me. My little brother figured out how to regurgitate(throw up) when ever he wanted basically. I was about 6-7 at the time and my mother took us to do laundry, Me and big sis begged her not to buy lil bro McDonald's in fear that he would vomit in the car. She brought him his food saying she would be quick and had the three of us sit in the car while she did laundry. So and behold lil bro gets bored and pukes. I let my older sister know so she can tell our mother. Big sis gets out goes into the laundry mat and comes out fine. Mom comes out of the laundry mat angry opens to he back door and starts slapping me around, grabbing my hair and yelling. She then had me take off my clothes to clean the mess my little brother made. She would not allow me to get clean clothes from the bags of laundry and hate me sit in the car naked beat up and snotty. When we got home the boys who lived on the block were playing basketball at the house across the street from ours. My mother tried to make me get out the car naked in front of them, I refused so she slapped me a few more times grabbed me by the hair and hit my head against the car door a few times then kind of shoved me back into the car and closed the door. She got my brother out of his side and had my big sister who looked terrified help her bring the clothes in and left me there. I stayed hidden in the back seat because I was nude and my face arms and legs hurt and I all honestly I was embarrassed and confused. Right before it got dark and 2 hours before our dad came home, she allowed me sister to bring out a small jacket to come inside. I was more releived that the boys were gone. I have a lot of memories like this, and I still loved her. Sorry for the long read or if I triggered anything, thank you for those who stayed and strolled down memory lane with me♥️"
"(So I know this may not truly qualify as abusive parents but I couldn’t post anywhere else so yeah) For context I’m 18, I’ve had screen time limits since I was 13, but at age 16 they got worse, basically making it so I can never use my phone, I am forced to request screen time even though I’m 18 because my parents still haven’t disabled the screen time or given me the password. So the reason I’m posting this is to get peoples opinion on the topic."
"When i lived in jordan with my really abusive dad and normal mom the best way to get what i wanted was lie it was so easy  and  i had to do it i needed to lie so much so often for so many things

Now after we ran away we live with my moms uncle wich is sadly also abusive but i grew up and wont let him get to me but thats beside the point. I cant stop lying to him about things and the lies are always bad because they just come out i cant even think so he always knows im lying and i get punished it feels like living with my dad made me lie 24/7 and i hate it"

(I hope you all read this, because I really need some advice)
Hello everyone, I am an 18 y.o boy.  I am from europe, I live with my parents and younger brother and we don't live in our country but in a foreign one. I have never complained online but now I really don't know what should I do....

 To get to the point, my mum doesn't let me go out but only when she sends me to the market (which is 4 minutes away from home), if I talk with a girl on social media she start yelling at me and says ""why do you talk with that girl, do you want me to call that girl?"", if my mum goes out, she doesn't let me stay alone at home (starts yelling untill I eventually give up and go with her) and manipulates everybody. 

To give some context:  From 2018 to 2021 I went out only two times and that was in front of our home. When I got to highschool things got different a little bit, she would drive and take me from highschool but when her car got damaged I went with bus, and that's where I had a bit of freedom. 

In May 2022, I asked my mum if i could go out with some school mates and a girl and she agreed, but she sent my father to watch me what I would do... It was a bit frustrating but I enjoyed the time out... Few days later my mum controlled my phone secretly and checked the texts between me and the girl I went out with and her social media and my mum saw that the girl was a bit depressed, had a few tattoos, medium-short hair and a few earrings. (That's when my mum started to manipulate the situation.) My mum reacted by saying that she was in shock because I talk with ""a depressive, punk girl like that"" and then she told everybody (aunts, uncles, my mum's parents) that I was part of a vicious cycle (which it was not true but my grandparents  and everyone else believed her). From that moment my mum told me that I won't go to that school anymore but because it was almost the end of the school year she lets me finish there. 

In the summer of 2022 my mum let me go around our little city with the bike. At the end of august I tried to smoke, my sister caught me smelling of cigarettes and told to my mum. When my mum asked me about it I didn't lie and told her that I did try a cigarette. After this event, in September 2022 she took me out of school, and didn't let me go out but only to the market. I tried to go to school in September 2022 untill she did the paperwork for taking me out of school, but she didn't let me.

 At the time I couldn't do anything because I was a minor, so I talked with one of my aunt (this happened still on 2022, around October) and she advised me that I should convince my mum to enroll me in highschool and if my mum wouldn't enroll me in highschool I should wait until I am 18 and then enroll me by myself to highschool... My birthday is on 4th December, and from September 2022 from December 2023 I only went out when my mum would send me to the supermarket or eventually when she went to the supermarket.

 A few months before my 18th birthday I started to talk to my uncles about everything that happened and I told them to help me to go in my country and stay to my grandparents (my mum's parents) so I can go to school, and they agreed to help me. My mum found out that my uncles (her brothers) would help me and she lied about the fact that she took me out of school and convinced them that I didn't went to school because I didn't want to. After some contradictory discussions (me telling my uncles that is not true what my mum says and my mum telling them that I lie) my uncles said that they won't help me anymore.

After my birthday (2023), I decided to talk to my grandpa (my mum's father). I told him the same things that I told to my uncles plus that she doesn't let me go out, and he said that first he wants to talk to my mum and secondly that I have to come to an agreement with my mum. My mum talked with him and said that she want to go in our country and there is no sense in me going alone a week before, then about the school she lied again in a lot of ways, firstly she said that I was going to school, then when she saw that my grandpa didn't believe her, lied and said that I didn't went to school because I didn't want to (which is not true). The about not letting me out my mum said that she lets me out (which is not true).   

Fast forward, my grandpa said that if my mum says that she will go in our country for Christmas holidays, to wait and come with her. We went for holidays in our country and there we all had long discussions with my grandpa (my mum's father). I told him that my mum took me out of school since September 2023. My mum would contradict me and say that I lie and that I went to school. My grandpa believed me after he asked to see my report card which my mum didn't have because I didn't go to school. That's when my mum started to put everyone against me, she said that I didn't went to school because I didn't want to and that then she actually took me out of that school because she wanted to put me in another school because I smoked and I was part of a group of all punk girls and boys that were doing drugs and stuff like this, but it was not true. From that moment everybody started to doubt what I say, except my grandpa. My grandpa said that she must enroll me back to school. I wanted to remain to school in my country with my grandparents but my mum lied that I can't remain there because my school transfer paper was not valid. We eventually come to an agreement with the help of my grandpa in which my mum let's me go out normally and enroll me back to a private school in the foreign country so I can recuperate the lost 2 years of highschool. 


That's what I did even if I didn't want to.My mum enrolled me to a private school 500 kilometers (310 miles) away where I can recuperate the lost years of school. But now, here, back in the foreign country, my mum again doesn't let me out not even for a walk. I go out only when she sends me to the market, or when I get my monthly haircut.  Whenever I ask her why doesn't she let me out she answer with ""Who said that I don't let you go out? Are you insane? I let you go out, but you don't want to go out"" (and that's what she says to everyone else...), but when I tell her that I wanna go out she says ""No, where do you go? ; If you go out you don't come back; No, you don't go out because you go to search drugs."" (I never touched drugs, I never talked with people who do/did drugs and never will.)

Now, my mum sometimes says that she won't pay my private school and to go wherever I want, or to go to work to pay my school and stuff like this, but when I am looking for a job and eventually have to meet for the interview she tells me not to go because we will leave the town and go in the town where I have school or on the day I have the meeting she takes me out of town with her because she have stuff to do but actually she only goes to shopping. And again if I want to stay at home while she goes, I can't, she starts yelling untill I eventually give up.  


My grandpa told me to wait untill the school year ends which is in June so we can see what happens. But based on what my mum says, and the fact that she doesn't let me out.. mostly always staying between 4 walls is not that nice..
So.. what do I do?? 


edit: My mum took me out of highschool after I finished the first year of highschool(June 2022), now the only reason I came back in this foreign country is because my mum said that she will enroll me in a private school where I would recuperate the lost years of highschool. She enrolled me in a prive school a month ago but I am not going physically to the private school because it's 500 kilometers away (310miles), now, sometimes she says that she won't pay the private school anymore and other times she says that she will pay it... (If she doesn't pay the private school I won't recuperate the missed years of highschool)."
"Putting this on a burner so my boyfriend doesn’t see it and get worried.

I (M17) have been dealing with incredibly abusive parents for a long time, I am currently 2-3 months away from moving out to go live with my grandmother and biological dad.

Yesterday when coming home from school I encountered a small brown bag on our doorstep, It had no labels and seemed to be empty and as someone who tries to pick up trash i shoved it into my pocket and went downstairs. When I took it out just to be safe i shook the bag and a small baggy of substance plopped onto my counter. 

I immediately texted my best friend who was around this kind of thing for a while due to her ex boyfriend and she confirmed it was a illegal drug in my area and it was twice the normal dose

I hid it in my run away bag (a bag that my grandma insisted i pack with important documents and other things) and started to freak out. my family has a doorbell cam and my step mother, who was the one who the drugs belonged to, called me and asked me if i’d picked up a bag. I laughed it off as i’d thrown it in my bin because it was just a brown bag but now i just don’t know what to do, i have photo evidence of the drug but i don’t nt know if this would affect my graduation and if I should just stay quiet until i leave or not. 

This has been where all the money to buy me and my brother food for has been going and even though I hate my mom and step mom I can barely even look at them bow

"
My mom has been an alcoholic, abusive, narcissist ever since I can remember. I’ve lived with her alone along with my sister since I was 12. She gained a bf and he moved in when I was around 14. They have an abusive relationship and constantly kept my sister and I awake at night fighting and blaming us basically for the fights. Cops have been to my house multiple times, but they ended up always defending each other. I was the peace maker of the house, and I basically faked my relationship with my mom throughout high school, so my mental health didn’t suffer more and my social life wasn’t taken from me. I finally had the guts to move out after high school. I bounced around houses because there was no where I could really stay for a while on end. My mom continued to contact me through this time, but I never responded. I moved across the country in November to get away from her and live on a mountain. She currently still contacts me and manipulates me. I do know that she loves me so much, but it’s toxic and she doesn’t want to live her own life. She wants to live through me and wants me to do what she wants. I really don’t know what to do anymore and I can’t seem to let her go fully, but in the end I really don’t want a relationship with her or her bf, but there’s some part of me thating feels bad for that, so I’ll still text occasionally (even tho I hate it) because she’ll send me care packages every now and then, so I know she cares, but not enough to actually change herself. I really don’t know if I should just drop her completely, or just ghost her like I normally do. I really don’t know what to do, but something needs to chnage and I just don’t know what to do. "
"Hi
I desperately need help at this point
I'm a 17 year old living in south africa. My father is incredibly emotinaly abusive and controlling and I can't escape I've tried social services before and after when I came home after he kicked me out, from a fight we had the day before, he yelled at me asking me to think about my step mum and how it effected her with her kids, they still yell at me about that, there have been so many other examples at this point. I don't know what to do anymore I don't have any family in south africa only in England, and my real mother is an alcoholic who abused me while my dad was away for work, she would be drunk for weeks from 5 am to 5 am and I was forced to steal money from her and buy my own food and stuff I got out once my father took me but that wasn't much better. I've attempted to kill myself 3 times now after severe complex ptsd and clinical depression and anxiety. My friends are worried and I don't want to kill myself but it's gotten so bad I just can't cope, I'm in therapys OT and seeing a regular phyciaterest and still when I get better he abuses me and then I go back down. At this point all of my support team hate him and I'm back to doing everything myself they forget to make food for me and prioritize my step brothers who are only here half the time over me who lives there full time and my brother's are a whole other story. I am completely out of ideas at this point and don't know what to do anymore please can somone give me some advice on what to do. I just want to be safe and feel safe and get out of this house. I am so scared all the time that he will yell at me and he yells at me for crying. How do I get out of this situation please 🙏 
Many thanks 0livander

"This may not be a coherent story, I'm just writing down whatever I can remember, whenever I can.

about me: I (21f) live with my parents. I have a sibling who lives abroad.  I am also an athlete. I have been homeschooled my entire life (2nd grade to senior year) and continue to be during my university years as well. This means I am always kept at home with no connect to the outside world other than my phone.
 I apologise for the format, I'm typing this on my phone and quickly.
background (my pov + what I was told): I was pretty much an unwanted child. My mother realised my dad was a whole lie after they got married, had a kid nevertheless, and it cemeted the fact they never wanted another. I was the kid after my mom terminated a fetus as well. So i am purely alive due to familial pressure. In the beginning I guess my mother didn't outwardly hate me so much. my father has never cared about me and didn't even come see me till I was about a year old (he used to travel abroad for work). 

It all went to shit when I turned 3, when I was put into my sport to learn and everyone around us kept telling I was talented. it didn't end well for me every day since i got beat up and compared to my sibling. you see, My sibling was the one who had passion about that sport. not me. but everyone told my parents that I had more talent and a future than she did. I hated this. I felt sorry, not in a pity way, but I hated that everyone had put so much pressure on them to prove people wrong. all of this affected my relationship with both my parents and my sibling. I was abused by some of my coaches many times. Hit, slapped, made to do so much extra workouts, insulted and had my character questioned. mind you, I was 6 at the time. I was nearly drowned in the name of punishment, had my fingers bent backwards, etc. Mind you, this was normal in our country and region. My parents never stepped in to stop this. They stepped in when the same thing happened to my sibling once, but not me. only when they started using them as insults towards me, which ended up hurting their ego and image did they step in. so they stopped it. 

My parents just took me home and continued to do what the coaches used to do, in addition to whatever they used to do as well. More than half the time, I was covered in bruises in areas where it won't be outwardly visible (ribs, stomach, head, etc). over the years I've developed a severe fear and dislike of physical contact, solely because of this. The only times my parents, sibling or coaches ever touched me was to hit me. 
The only times I was never yelled at, hit, or told i should die,was when they used to send me off to my grandparents so that I won't bother them.
My extended family knows about all of this. They never said anything. they tried, once, long ago. They didn't let my grandparents see me for nearly half a year. they never asked again. 

over the years, I've become a near carbon copy of my parents, especially my father. I look near exactly like him, have his personality apparently. He's never cared about the family in general, so when people look at me, they only see an extension of him. So my mother, who despises him, treats me how she wishes she treated him. so I've been hit with hot metal utensils, had hot food thrown at me, metal plates (to eat with) thrown, etc. 
Through all of this, I oddly enough, happened to win a couple of state and national trophies in my name in my sport. One coach saw the ""potential"" I had in me and pushed me to do better, and was more of a father  figure to me than anyone else. My mother broke all of my trophies once when she was yelling at me, as punishment. I'm also not allowed to try and fix it, even with tape, to serve as a reminder of my ""mistake"". the mistake being I lost a couple of gold medals to another athlete, but qualified for the higher competition nonetheless. 
Through all of this, my parents also used to give me hell in front of my sibling, just to make them feel better. Mind you, they weren't useless at all. they actually got to a higher position in the sport than I did, but my parents still continue to say that I'll never be like them. Both my parents hate each other, they see each other when thry look at me, so both of them don't treat me right. I have a very monotone way of speaking, naturally. I also speak in mix of British and American English, solely because i learned to speak and talk via watching movies and TV shows, instead of my parents trying to teach me. my parents havr tried to cut my throat once for the way I speak, the dead sounding tone. So I learned to fake the times when I speak to people, although I'm not very good at it.  even something simple as ""oh i don't want that"" comes off as blunt and harsh. I picked up in sarcasm as a method to avoid answering questions when the few friends I had realised I had bruises and was in pain almost all the time..

over the years, i finally gave up on trying to earn their love and respect, so it just ended up as me looking like a terrible human being to everyone. I got bitter during my peak teenage years, and lashed out occasionally. I admit, I am a bit of a trashy human being. I'm still learning to let go. I have a few friends now, after they fought with my parents to still be friends with me. They are the only ones who see the real me, and are the only people I've ever told this to. They call me out on my bs but all of them, including THEIR parents understand why I'm snappy and sarcastic sometimes. There have been times when my parents sent me off to practice with no food in my system, so the used to give me some of their snacks before it started so that I won't faint. 
These people and my cats are the only reasons why I haven't ended it yet. I have considered. I used to self harm to cope with my life. But yeah. 
I can't really write as i never developed the skills, so maybe I could have put this better to make it more accurate sounding. but I don't know. 
This is all I can remember at the moment. I may sound like I'm just complaining, and if that is what you feel it is, I accept the judgement. I just needed a place to vent, that my parents and sibling will never find.

"When I was a young  kid around 6-8  years old, I didn’t know it then but I had severe depression and ptsd from my parents very messy divorce where they used me as ammo in the courts, which lasted until I was 18. There where two times that I can remember where I went “comatose” for 48 hrs, no one was able to wake me so my father left me there to sleep for two days. My little body could t handle the mental stress of the being used like that and living in a different home every week where I was constantly manipulated into saying something that they could use against each other in court amongst many other similar things. 

As I grew older around 12-13 years old it happened again to me where I slept through my alarm for school. So my father had the best idea, he grabbed the biggest pot he could find from the kitchen and filled it with ice cold water. He came to my room and slowly pours the pot out onto my face and head completely soaking me, my bed, blankets and pillows. I shot up in shock choking on the water as it was poured into my open mouth aswell as on everything else. I watched him lightheartedly say you need to get up when I tell you to and not miss your alarm or the discipline will be more severe next time as he walked out of my room. 

I made it to school 15 min late, first class hadn’t even started yet. They day ends and I come home to find my bed and everything else hasn’t dried in the slightest so end up having to sleep in a cold soaking wet bed with cold wet pillows and blankets. They would not last me sleep anywhere else except my bed because I was being “dramatic”. Now get this, next day rolls around and it fucking happens to me again where I slept through both of my alarm clocks and I’m dead to the world in a soaking wet bed and this mofo comes in with another pot of water! Except this time my head was faced towards the wall so my ear was facing directly up and as you can guess that’s exactly where it was poured first… from a height it hit me square in the ear and almost blew my ear drum out from the pressure.

Fast forward 15 years and he is on his deathbed and has somehow found my address “I moved across the country and went no contact as soon as turned 18”. He is asking me to atleast respond to his letter since he is “not long for this side of the river” in his words and that he dosnt think I should not talk to him because of his issues with my mother in the past. I am beyond livid that he could so blatantly disregard all the other reasons why I would ever want to never to all to him again, I understand why people like him only half truths to make them sound better but goddam I want to burn his house down and watch the light leave his eyes. 

( sry if you the story came off pretty choppy it was pretty difficult to put this in words not bring up the other details that made this even worse then what ive written down). 

Thx for taking the time to read this if you have made it this far, i just needed to get this off my chest. Hope yall have a good rest of your day."
"For context, me and my parents are all neurodivergent and have trouble expressing our emotions in a healthy way. Also, both of my sisters have since moved out, so I’m left without a mediator. 

I’m not great at waking up for school in the mornings, and usually end up waking up late. I set my alarms and my parents try to help wake me up too by calling me through the echo dot in my room, but I just kept falling asleep this morning. It’s 7:20 am now, I have to leave in less than 30 minutes. My mom noticed, and was NOT happy. She stormed down to my room and opened the door, ripped the blankets off me, picked up the full water bottle on my nightstand and dumped it all on me. Not only did it get on me but everything around me, including the new book I just got. I was pretty shocked.

Both of my parents, especially my mom, has a history of taking her anger out on me. I’ve been spanked many more times than both of my sisters combined. I’ve been slapped, screamed at, had my hair pulled, had things thrown at me, and been threatened SO many times. Also I’ve been grounded from all possible electronics, even as simple as an MP3 player for weeks at a time. There have been times that they’ve thrown and/or hid away foods because my ARFID gives me many problems when it comes to eating dinner. Why do I get these punishments? Sometimes I don’t know. It could be for having a “bad attitude,” poor time management, talking back (or as I like to call it, having conversations or speaking my mind), or whatever. 

I know that they love me and want the best for me but I don’t think they have EVER treated my sisters this way. I understand that I am more stubborn and mentally challenged but this is getting outrageous. I don’t feel safe at home. Even though I have it way better than most kids, it’s made my mental health worse and I can’t stand it anymore."
"I know im young.( Im turning 13 in 2 weeks from now) I live with my grandparents. My Na n gives me no privacy at all and forces me to go to bed at 7:30. Sometimes earlier. She blames every argument on me and treats my sister better than me. Im suffering from deppression and sh at the moment but neither of my grandparents helped. I found cp on my Grandads phone and hes always creepy toward me. My Nan takes my phone away from me, which keep in mind she didnt purchase so it is entirely my property. Im a part of the LGBTQ+ community and i came out to her several times but she still pressures me to get with a man and makes jokes that are uncomfortable to me. Im not allowed to buy anything or even leave the house. Not allowed any food without asking first. Sometimes they hit me but not often. Sorry for the long vent. Is this abuse or just being strict?"

"On bad terms with both parents. Recently went through a miscarriage while in a fight with my dad, he teased me for it. I haven't spoken to him for 5 months. 

Today, I spoke to my mom for the first time in a year. Last time we talked, I called the cops on her for animal cruelty. I was subpoenaed to testify against her in court with my brother. When we saw her, she gave me a hug. We talked for a while even though it was uncomfortable. It made me emotional because that hug felt like the last hug I'll ever give her. 

I'm obviously not going into a whole lot of detail, but never in my life did I think I would give her one more hug. She told me to keep in touch; but with her past record of threats and pure hatred for motherhood, I won't let it happen.

My parents are alive and mostly well. But there is nobody on earth who could say anything more hateful than the words of my mother and father. I mourn the relationship I wanted with them, I'm so broken. I love them, but I mourn them every single day. I'm no longer damaging my mental health for trash treatment."

"I was born in LA and my dad (i know this from what my mom told me) was a drug addict and hit her but she didn't leave for me and my sisters sake.

 when i was 4 my dad went to jordan to visit his parents he was supposed to come back but for some reason they decided it was better to live there so for the next 11 YEARS i lived with my abusive grandparents and dad then my dad went to jail a couple times and then he started drinking instead of drugs since it was legal.

 he would hit us, yell at us and then he would start crying to make us feel bad and we'd comfort him one time he slaped me in a store multiple times then threw me down some stairs and then he started crying and i had to comfort him.

My mom finally came to her senses and left him while planning how to take us back to the usa we eventually managed to run away to florida but it wasn't over.

we moved in with my moms uncle wich was supposedly a nice guy but no he's still abusive (much less than my dad) but still enough to make me not want to go home.

 and this is especially bad since for 11 years we thought wed get at least a normal life when we go to america and i keep thinking of how even one small thing like me having a normal dad would've given me an infinitely better life.

With some simple changes i couldn't lived a happy life instead of crying myself to sleep every night."
"I'm 18 and I still can't live on my own (yet) but right after I turned 18 my parents started acting like they're actually changing and it's making me upset and frustrated. Like they're only doing this to keep me in their lives because I'm no longer legally required to be. They say they're worried about my (and my siblings) futures but they've done so much damage when we needed them most. I don't want to forgive and forget and just move on but not only do I feel guilty from them being like ""you have to work with us/we're trying to speak to you like an adult"" but also that other ppl have said that all that's being asked of parents is to try. I gave them so many chances I'm just tired of living in unpredictability and honestly don't know if the relationship can even be saved. They weren't the worst out there but what they did hurt a lot and sticks with me. All they have to say is ""I'm sorry if what we did in childhood traumatized you"" usually followed up with ""parenting is something you learn along the way"". That doesn't mean I needed to be abused though. I just. I want to know if I'm wrong for any of this. Wanting to cut them off asap/feeling like they're abusive kind of stuff. I feel like them going ""it's just your perspective"" trips me up sometimes like maybe it didn't happen. "
"So many people don’t know my secret about my parents. I live in an orthodox Jewish community where everyone knows each other and if I write the truth about my parents in my book, it will be bad for them. But they are sometimes ok and sometimes very ok but other times they are terrible. They unlock my wheelchair so I can’t move trapping me. They call me names left and right. They think I’ll never accomplish my dreams. They are so negative I hate them but then other times they do little things like bring back food from a restaurant for me or spend a little time with me (rare) and I think they can’t be all bad. They have broken me beyond words I don’t even know where to start but to sum it up, they are emotionally abusive and neglectful so much. I do not know where to start I want so badly to write my story but I am still living at home in this toxic atmosphere. I’m 31 btw. And I am severely disabled in a wheelchair with various medical equipment. I have full time nurses that take care of me way better than parents.

"My sister, around her sophomore of high school, showed my father's same pathological/annihilative envy. It's pretty clear he's extremely jealous of me and has been for a long time, even going so far to sabotage me as to steal 75% of my college fund so I couldn't get further schooling. ""Avoidance of your abilities"", ""trying to forget you exist"" (literally Uncle Vernon style; even gets the beet red face), and missing all my important milestones on purpose growing up makes it pretty clear. At first, when I was growing up, I thought my sister wouldn't be like him. But then she started a disturbing trend of getting jealous of the class above her's valedictorian, and started acting like her, doing everything she did, smiling like her...eventually not only did she also have to be valedictorian and take all the exact same subjects, but she even ended up marrying her ex-boyfriend. Like there is jealousy, and then there is something a little more disturbing that's still based in jealousy. She has done the same things to me, like when I got into a software engineering school, she went into the next room and starting coding with R for \*literally no reason\* other than to take the focus away from me getting in. She also asked my grandfather who was prettier and clearly was expecting to hear herself, and when she heard me, she hasn't been able to let go of it since, and looks like she might have sicked her whole husband's family on me even though I don't talk to anyone just to get back at me out of a response I had no control over. Again, I don't talk to literally any of them nor want to, but they all show signs of her trying to use them to fix that clearly extreme narcissistic injury. Finally, it's just gotten over the top where she's been doing work in my major and trying to give me her old phones and avoid what's going on with my father because it suits her sabotaging goals.

Like there is jealousy, and there is NEXT LEVEL jealousy. I really thought my sister would be different, but she is NEXT LEVEL jealous like my father is, so it's clearly genetic. I literally do not feel jealousy. I feel injustice, but I tend to have more of a fawn/admire response when someone is clearly way better than me in some way. These definitely have an annihilate/ignore even murder response that is clearly genetic. Is there any literature on this kind of thing? My sister thinks my marriage was about her and refused to admit I got engaged. She literally told my aunt I got married to compete with her, even though it was two years after her marriage and I had been engaged to someone else long before she was even engaged...I just hadn't told her because...ironically...I didn't want her to get jealous and feel like I hadn't ""waited my turn"" because she can be like that. Nevertheless, that one broke off, and years later, and two years later after her wedding, I would get married. None of it had anything to do with her, I just had attended her wedding and was seeing if she would attend mine when it happened...from her response, I could guess at the rest of my family's response. She wouldn't even acknowledge I had said it. I mean, really, that's kind of next level f\*cked up. But from what she told my aunt, it's clear that she definitely heard it.

Now that I work for my current boss, it seems like what he would say is she ignored me because that's why she got married. To make me jealous. He says to avoid that kind of person who doesn't believe things or doesn't do things because they themselves wouldn't do it. That never crossed my mind; I was so happy to be at the wedding, I was dancing and excited and having fun. It never even crossed my mind to be jealous, and all my friends from high school who were there will say that. Now I'm wondering if that's what she was hoping for. That's disgusting.

I thought since she had gotten married she could now be happy for me, in a new marriage that was more ""in time"" with things, but nope, she literally would completely avoid the topic. Like literally pretend she didn't hear. She also tries to give me her hand me downs despite this is disgusting for a grown adult woman to gift another grown adult woman with their own jobs, and she clearly enjoys hearing when I go through abuse or have periods of poverty. She seems seriously sick, and she's just like my dad in this way, to the extremely aggressive ways they will show extreme envy.

There is taking some of the person you're envious of's characteristics and resources, and then there is FULL out denial, taking everything about you to do with them, not giving you ANYTHING, and trying to BECOME or DESTROY you. Like this is NOT normal, very scary, and clearly genetic, because they both act like this.

It's one thing to be jealous, it's another to clearly have pretty much murderous envy. Can someone PLEASE explain this in family? I keep looking up filicide, siblicide, but nothing is making this make sense. I literally do not have this gene. All I have is what my grandfather said is that I seem like I'm actually Italian and she seems more Polish, and my grandmother has a lot of the same envy problems, to the point she would hoard tons of stuff while her family was living in poverty, and when they said, ""you know, lady, that's kind of effed up"" she would say, ""oh they're jealous"". I mean that's just narcissism, and I know my sister ended up taking the fellow narcissist path in the family while I took the black sheep path, but nevertheless hers is just WOW. OVER THE TOP. Like it is definitely not normal. **To the point I have reason to believe she can't even accept I'm a math teacher, and is even competing with me in my calculus skill, even though I DON'T SPEAK TO HER AT ALL After I heard what she thought my marriage was about from my aunt and I was blown away by how sick in the head that was, especially as I had been engaged way earlier than she had been and politely had kept it quiet so she could get married first because I know how she could be. NONE of it had anything to do with her. It was beyond disturbing to hear that from my aunt.**

 **It meant she had legitimately heard and understood what I said and purposefully stonewalled, and then gossiped about it later. Usually when I see my father doing this, I think he's gone temporally intellectually disabled or something and literally isn't letting it in. This proved that wrong. It was BEYOND disturbing, because it means they know what they're doing when they're stonewalling, and purposefully do it. It's not a mental block. Again, I can't emphasize how DISTRESSING AND DISTURBING it is to have found that out, about both of them.**

My father however is not on that side of the family. He has English and German genes, and she acts more like him. My parents admit she can't think metacognitively in the same way, can't think big picture abstractly without a ton of effort, as the only difference. My parents say they tried to philosophize with her but she just can't really, and kind of takes a cheap move to get out of it most every time. I've looked into PFC deficits and murderous envy but other than psychopathy, I can't find much...usually psychopaths don't have that much like obsessive, annihilative envy. I don't see how this factors into envy that aggressive though, or what my grandfather meant when he said ""I seem more Italian"" in my personality. It seems way more intense than most of the narcissistic literature I'm reading, but psychopathy doesn't fit the more envious, vain feature both of them also show. I have no idea  what is; the only thing that have resonated is content on siblicide and filicide, and it's EXTREMELY scary."

"AITA for wanting to cut off my whole family?


I (21 F) moved out 6 months after graduating high school (4 years ago). I grew up in a “picture perfect family” and an extremely abusive family (my parents are split). Around the age 12 I didn’t want to go to my moms house anymore, my dad made me go for one last weekend when Sunday came around I was looking for my mom to take me home when I found her on the bathroom floor (think the worse), she was trying to unalign herself bc I didn’t want to come back. 

Fast forward to me being 21 I’m trying to have a relationship with my parents, my mom got better (she divorced and stopped using) and I know when I’m ready to have a relationship with her she will be hoping I’m like a kid riding a horse for the first time. 
My dad on the other hand… he can’t even say hi to me without it sounding like Barb wire around his throat. Everytime I try to talk to him he shuts down like a toddler and blames it all on me… his words were “your Trama was self conflicted and nothing bad happened at my house”. I was just neglected and yelled at the whole time I was at his house. 


I may not have been abused at his house but he forced me to go to a household that was (and he had his suspicions it was abusive).
 He works a lot and my whole life he would work come home and sit in the garage and smoke (cigarettes and or trees). 
I (21) am tired of trying to implement the relationship but he is still hung up on the fact I was groomed when I was 13  and that “I should’ve been more smart not to even be in the position”. 

I have lots of Trama I can go on about but when I talk to him about it he can’t even just be like “I’m sorry I forced you to go”or “I didn’t know that happened to you”. Tbh if he would’ve just not let my mom see me after her house was raided I would be a completely different person (btw they left me at a SA predators house for the rest of the weekend when my moms house was raided and I was SAd but that was “self conflicted too”) 

I was also SAd by a substitute teacher in highschool he grabbed my boobs and tried to force me into the back closet…the school said it was my fault for wearing a low hanging shirt. They called my dad after it happened and he never came to get me I was forced to stay at school and finish out the day, when I got home my dad said the same thing that my shirt was “revealing”. (It was a v neck back t shirt and a amberceombie hoodie, jeans, and slides. For those who want to know) 


My dad’s side tries so hard to deny all of it and they (his wife and him) tell me I made it up in my head or saw it in a movie…. But yet when I moved out I ended up getting a neurologist confirming that my brain has been through so much Trama it’s permanently damaged and in result I have PNES (psych non epileptic seizures) 

I just want a family I can hang out with go grocery shopping with, be a family with.

"Rambling post sorry in advance:

Without getting into it to deeply, both my mom and dad (divorced) were emotionally abusive to me (29f) in different flavors. With my mom, she is textbook narcissistic, hiding a deepl damaged and vulnerable core and lashes out constantly about it. I’ve been no contact with her and low contact at different points, but after my grandfather died two years ago we got closer, and I started to really worry about her. Her external shell really cracked, and every scaffolding she’d built for her life and her emotions came tumbling down. 

Since then we’ve had really good and really bad times, and I’ve driven to her (7 hours) multiple times when I thought she was in a really dark place. I worry about her mentally, emotionally, and I’ve had a really hard time putting boundaries back up when I know she has basically no one else in her life anymore.

She sends me massive long catastrophizing   texts, she refuses any and all suggestions of solutions or offers of help but will later say no one ever does anything for her. I’ve been better about ignoring or not engaging with those, but the problem is lately…her situation HAS gotten really bad. She’s getting evicted, there’s probate issues with her fathers estate, she might be getting a divorce. 

There not really anything I can do about these situations. It’s not my life and I can’t help or control it. I know that. Even if it was possible I have zero resources or means with which to help and doing so would put a strain on my relationships and life. But the problem is that I can’t get rid of the worry and guilt and panic anyway, especially when she tells me how awful everything is and goes back to defeatism. If she’s pretending it’s all good, I can pretend and we can still have some good memories. But otherwise I get consumed with this feeling…

Any advice on how to distance myself from her problems without just giving up on the relationship entirely? Discussions with her will never work, and I’m not willing at this point to go no contact again. (I know, I know, I just don’t have it in me rn). How do I get rid of this gnawing feeling inside?

The abuse lead to me ending up living with a sexually, physically, emotionally, and financially abusive boyfriend for 6 years after I became homeless as a senior in high school. I'm 33 now and I still struggle with the trauma from the abuse and it often presents itself whenever I am in a high conflict situation, especially in a work environment, my body starts shaking and I can't control it. I try really hard to discuss rationally with the other person who has escalated the situation but it's so embarrassing that I have no control over body when this happens. I'm now at a job with a supervisor who takes her frustrations out on me whenever something happens between her and her boss and always tries to frame whatever happened into being somehow my fault. Every time she comes to my desk, I have that familiar fear of ""what did I do wrong now,"" even though I know I've done nothing wrong, and I've done everything that she's ever asked me to do.

My father leaves mess everywhere and I'm not joking, clutter , dishes, food , big bags absolutely everything. We live in a 3 bedroom town house so it's large and it's on me and only me to clean this. I can gut the house (bare in mind I've been doing this since I was 12 years old) and then go to school/work and come home to a mountain of mess because he's decided he wanted to cook for himself or he has pulled stuff out of cupboards and just leaves it expecting me to clean it, this happening everyday is exhausting and because of it I never had a childhood. I have spoke to him about it multiple times over the years and it results in an argument and him saying that it's his mental health , but he can easily get up and do things that suit him while leaving the mess for me, Surely this isn't normal? 

To add to that, recently I have been going through a diet change so it means I meal prep on a Sunday and that does my food for the week. My dad cooks his own food. However every time he cooks his food he will shout me to come clean his mess and it's not got anything to do with me, so every night I'm cleaning the kitchen after he's cooked his meals and then he leaves his plate for me to get as well. 

My dad is also of the opinion that his word is law and due to the hierarchy of the way society is set, I have to do what he says when he says - now I understand you need to do what your parents tell you to do but this man is riddled with PTSD, Anxiety, short term memory loss and he changes his mood and mind every 5 mins so from a very young age I haven't ever been confident in his parenting abilities. He is also of the opinion that during an argument/debate I'm not allowed to share my opinion, have an opinion or go against his beliefs. He also has said to me before "" you should be grateful because as a parent I don't need to like you, accept you or let you live here yet I do"" his views on the world really scare me 

He constantly is manipulating and gas lighting me in every single situation, it's so bad that I can't even have a normal conversation about my work because he will put in his own way of how I need to handle something and i explain back that I can't do that and he gets angry and starts an argument then blames it on me, says I'm not good for his mental health and I get called all the names under the sun 

He used to try convince me I needed therapy because I had multiple issues and that I had an eating disorder (which isn't true I used to struggle to eat beacuse I was under stress and anxiety living under his roof) he did convince me to go and when I went to therapy the woman genuinely asked me ""why I was here because the only reason it sounds like I'm here is because my dad told me to, and there isn't anything wrong to be fixed with me"" when I told my dad that he told me I needed a new therapist. 

It's just all getting a bit much, he been dealing with this for 10 years and the older I get the worse it is as I now notice a lot of things 

I just need someone to read this and tell me that none of that is normal and I have a right to hate my father

"My sister (22) is being constantly abused by mother. She manipulates, gaslight, threatens, practically everything in the book of being an abusive piece of shit. I come from an indian family so she threatens my sister with marriage A LOT. And I need help since my mother said she will marry her off once she turns 25.

My sister can't become independent as she doesn't have a proper stable job yet and my parents are pretty much confining her to the house and is constantly isolating all her choices of becoming independent. If my sister runs away from the house, my mother will kill herself. I asked other people on what to do but all of them keep saying just let her marry but thats just like letting my mother ruin her life more, my sister literally cried how her life is already so destroyed that theres no point in doing anything.

She's also scared of the abuse towards me going even worse but I told her that I'm fine with it and I can handle it. I'm more worried about her since she has so much pressure from my parents as she is one of the most important finanical support in the family so I doubt they will just let her go so easily and become indepedent.

My dad is a not good person to ask help as he is an enabler and always makes my mom angry and she takes it out on my sister. I do plan on somehow getting a part time job but I'm still a minor and here we need permission from parents to get a job and they are pretty much refusing any chance of me getting a job before college. Please give me help, I don't want her life to be over."

"My parents are extremely religious.
Every time I make friends there’s something wrong with them and they hate them.
They think friendships aren’t important only family is.
I will try talking to them into allowing me to have friends and go out with them often (I’m currently allowed to go out around once a month after begging them)and they get mad at me for this still.
Any tips on how to approach this ? I want to get on their good side I can’t handle any more of this.
How do I convince them friends are okay and it’s okay if they don’t dress modestly it doesn’t mean they are sl*ts.

"Hello everyone,
Hope y’all are doing good!
I wanted to share with someone with familiar story to mine, but happily, people surrounding me haven’t faced such nightmares as I did! Anyways, I’m here for the good news.
After living with abusive parent for 18 years (my other parent left us right after my birth, so it was me and this person only), I’m really close to moving! I’m currently looking for a job, doing my CV tomorrow and sending it as application! I’m still in high school, so it will be hard for me, but I found a room for students at small rent! 
I’m writing this to encourage everyone here, who is living in toxic household that it comes to an end! The abuse will be over! You will heal! And love! And live your best life!
Sending you much love 🩷"
"I’m finding it really hard to deal with my mom’s constant tantrums and emotional manipulation. I flinch and tense up when she comes into my room cause any conversation could end up with her throwing a tantrum, berating and insulting me, making me feel like shit and refusing to leave. How do I manage to avoid this happening cause no matter how hard I try and avoid touchy subjects she somehow finds a way to make me feel like shit?"

"I want to start off by saying that this is less of AITA and more of me looking for validation and advice. I (14 F) and my mom (37 F) have been “fighting” constantly for around three years which is around the same time my father lost custody of me. My mother always initiates fights with me over the most random/ridiculous things. Due to my PTSD from my father trying to unalive my mother in front of me multiple times I had severe attachment issues with my mother. Looking back I realized that my mother liked the fact that I had these issues because she could easily control me. Unfortunately this made it a very hard transition into middle school where I was often bullied for my home life. I used to be so confused about the sudden resentment,emotional manipulating, and gaslighting so much so that I would silently cry on the floor of my bathroom or in a corner of my room. Eventually I began to detach more from my mom and develop new relationships. Unfortunately since I had no real Idea what a healthy relationship was, I became friends with people who looking back where definitely not the best friendships. I’m not going to get too deep into some of the fights we have gotten into because I fear that somehow someone will identify me. But I’m just gonna say that she would exhibit very phycotic behavior while know one else was around. I also feel very separate from the rest of the family since I have a half sister who is 9 years younger than me who will continue to have a completely different childhood than me. When I was her age we where in the lower income bracket moving from apartment to apartment and from boyfriends house to boyfriends house. There was also a period of time I lived with my grandmother. I also watched my dad pass out on the couch from illegal substances and I watched him get arrested to many times to count. Meanwhile she goes to target to get Barbie dolls multiple times a week and gets everything she could ever ask for. Then my mom will say stuff like “oh you where the same way her age” or when I will mention we have different experiences she will say “only with your father” which makes me very upset because yes my father is not a good person and a horrible father but she has done so many damaging things over the years that go unmentioned.I also constantly have to baby sit her without being paid or having any validation for the hours I spend being an extra parent to her. I do so much with our any recognition. I love my sister it’s not about her it’s about them. Now that it is a two parent household I feel that I should not have to parent her the way I do especially with zero validation/payment. I’ve tried to set so many boundaries with them but my mom called be entitled and screamed at me to go to my room. She also took off my doorknob for multiple months and constantly goes through my phone as she has made it clear that there is no privacy in this house. She has also told me multiple times not to tell my school counselor about stuff at home and she constantly makes stuff up to strangers. My mom also makes it very known that being with my father was a huge mistake and says things like “I learned my lesson” and will make it very known that I was unplanned and will go into detail talking about the multiple different forms of protection that they used. She told me that she tried being with him for about 5 months after I was born but just couldn’t manage it. She also will put up a huge K for the rest of the family last name. It really upset me when I was a bit younger so I asked if she could add an S for me or move it into another room that I don’t really go into much because my mom turned it in to a play room for my sister. Which by the way used to be a dining room that was in my mind when I was younger a symbol of what a “normal” family had which my mom was very aware of. Anyway she never moved nor got an S for my last name and just pretty much ignored my request. When I finally made friends with people who I felt very connected with she constantly called them names like stupid,idiot,bitch,etc. She often imply a that having me as a daughter is super hard and that she’s practically an angel for putting up with me. The thing is I’m a pretty good kid, I get As and Bs I’ve never vaped tried alcohol or any illegal substances and I’ve never had s3x before. At this point I’ve fully accepted the fact that our relationship won’t be better and I’m not even sad anymore I’m just tired and confused and don’t know what to do.anything sers her off and we fight multiple times a day. She tells me to go away or be quiet multiple times a day but when I leave her alone she tells me I’m not an active member of the family and I need to talk to her more . I don’t like talking to because it often leads to an argument or her rolling her eyes and telling me she’s busy. The only time she really talks to me is to yell at me. On top of this my father recently started reaching out to me, which made my relationship with my mom worse since even though she won’t admit it she is visibly upset that I responded to him. I’m not saying I want a relationship with him at all he’s not a good person but also as a 14 yr old I’m very confused about everything and the way she treats me makes me want to reach out to him. At the same time he has admitted to unaliving someone before and getting away with it and he was also in a gang and has a lot of substance abuse issues. His current wife also expresses her extreme dislike for me and has told me multiple times that she doesn’t like me. He also lives in Hawaii and I live in New Jersey and have not seen him in over three years. There is so much more but it’s a lot. If anyone wants me to post any update or answer any questions I can. Again I’m not looking for advice to reconcile with my mom since honestly I don’t think I can forgive her/look past everything she’s done, but instead for some advice on how to deal with the next 4 years. Also I do online school for this year just for some background info. Anyway sorry this is so long and for this being so scattered due too my ADD.

"Idk,recently when my mom hits me it doesn’t even hurt, and the most recent one where she hit my ass twice with the kinda heavy wood back scratcher, it just kinda felt cold where she hit me, still hurt, but it felt kinda cold there after. Is there a reason?"
My dad is forcing me out but he won’t let me take any of my belongings not even my clothes. (I’m moving in with my mom) is he able to keep my belongings from me like this?
