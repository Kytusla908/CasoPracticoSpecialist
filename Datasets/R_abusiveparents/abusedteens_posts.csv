"So my mum is textbook abusive but not often enough that I’m certain she’s the one that’s a bad person and not me but not seldom enough that it can just slide as normal emotional stress or dysregulation

So basically:
1.  Always always keeps repeating and doing things I tell her not to do, then telling me that I’m being abusive to her when I get annoyed
2. Deliberately pissing me off (like standing a metre away from me hours at a time while I’m trying to study) even when I tell her respectfully that it’s difficult for me to focus then accuse me of not appreciating her, not letting her do her duty as a mother
3. Comparing and name calling (self explanatory)
4. Any argument against her can never be won because she immediately goes like “okay I’m always wrong and you’re always right isn’t it” or “you think you know everything you just have to blindly obey me” or something to that extent
5. I struggle with self harm. Her first reaction was to hit me/be like “you are deliberately doing this to hurt me and continue doing it if you want me to die”
6. Forcing me to do things I don’t want like eat things I don’t want 
7. I have to drop everything and do things for her or she’ll get angry. But if I want or need anything then she gets angry 
8. The world operates on her schedule

But like she gives me a home and a good education and stuff so like does she have the right to do these kinds of things

And the internet tells you to set and establish boundaries but the thing is that this kind of people don’t respect or recognise those boundaries

So please tell me what can I do
Also I can’t move out cos I’m 17 lol"
"Hello, 
I have never made a Reddit post before but here I am. 
When I was a child my mother lost custody of me because she was and currently is addicted to drugs. My father fought for custody of me and won. Although I was severely traumatized by my mother’s addiction. My father did his best to be there for me until he got a girlfriend. When we met she said, “I was thinking we could be friends”. As a child I was like yay friend and became excited. But as soon as it became official my father stopped spending nearly any time with me and began spending all of his time with his girlfriend. Next thing I know he’s proposed to her dumb ass and we’re moving to a different city. Leaving all of my other family and only friends I knew. I had to acclimate to a new setting. My step mom began telling me what to do, acting like my mother when we did not have a built relationship. I did not respond well to this and cussed her out. Years into these issues she came at me one day; slamming my body into the counter and throwing a French press at me. I was 17 when this happened and my step mom lied to my father saying that nothing happened. The next day when I went to school I told my guidance counselor and he called my family. They denied what happened. Just today I’ve had just about enough. My ex boyfriend abused me when I said I wanted to be with women. The first thing that popped into my mind was my step mom putting her hands on me. I frequently have flash backs about my step mom’s behavior. The worst part is, she’s a social worker/ therapist. Ethically bound to support those vulnerable to manipulation; she violated her license by putting her hands on me all those years ago. To this day she denies ever having done it. 
I’m proud to say that through everything I haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole and have continued to work on myself and my career goals. 
The issue is, I don’t want to be around my family anymore. I just can’t get over the fact that my step mom did that to me and then keeps asking to be in my life without taking responsibility. 
I also called her the wicked bitch of the west and sent her a long message claiming how she’s violated the field we both work in and asking her to not be around me without taking responsibility. A message I’ve been putting off for the past 10 years. 
What should I do ? 
I’m at a crossroads and I don’t want to reinforce to my family that this is okay. "
"I (M 23) have tried to be nice to my parents and support them. For 3 years I have been living with them because they can't seem to get their things together. It's now become that I'm paying 75% of rent (not even including the utilities) and when I somehow have money it's for their smoking habit, and my dad constantly drinks my alcohol. (No matter where I hide it, my fault I know) making him aggressive. But this entire month was my breaking point.

They asked for my very little savings for their smoking, when I told them I wasn't even making enough to support myself with how much they've taken from me the past 3 years, they just told me to stop making them feel guilty. I had essentially had a meltdown and told them there's no way I was okay with any of this. They had gotten so unappreciative in the past year, given our history, they should be glad I've stuck with them this long, and other abusive parents would be begging for this kind of support from their child.

Last year I wanted to get my own place but they had barely looked for their own place, and again, my heart got in the way of logic. Before I submitted the application I had I looked for places for us. My new decision has to be that the bandaid has to be pulled off, my dad's an unemployed, Q enthusiastic, narcissist. And my mom has to unfortunately go down with him. Debt is hurting my chances of getting my own place, and if I can't get out next year it's as good as over for me.

Tldr: parents are financially abusive and It's time for me to realize if I don't leave them next year it's never gonna happen."
"I need some advice, it will be a bit long, but it is necessary to make the whole situation clear.

Ever since I was a little girl, my father told me that I had to work for his company(now I'm 24), but I always said that I wanted to do something else. At the moment I have a contract job, but in order to continue working I will necessarily have to open a VAT number and this will require a lot of costs for me, but I would like to at least try to see what I can achieve in terms of work. As soon as my father heard about it from my mother, he started complaining and said that I have to give up and work for him. He told me these precise words: ""It's not a request, it's an imposition, you just have to do it.""



My response was: ""You have to mind your own business, I want to see my things to understand where I can go"" almost crying.



In response he told me that if I continued talking he would punch me in the teeth and so to prevent the situation from getting worse I kept quiet.



He later told me that I will no longer be able to use the car, not even if I pay him for petrol and that I will have to give him €250 a month (which is fine for me) and continue to take care of my younger brothers.



Now I have to take a step back to make the situation better clear for everyone.

Years ago I ran away from home because my parents didn't allow me to study and didn't allow me to work, they just wanted me to do the things they told me, almost like a slave. After my mother begged me I came back and things changed, I continued to keep my brothers and do what they said, but they gave me the opportunity to do smart working. Now after these 2 years, my father began to say that even if I earn large amounts of money with the work I do, I won't have a future if I don't work for him.



The reason why I don't want to work for him is because he basically likes to control and subjugate his family with money and if he had this possibility with me too, I would have to do everything he tells me, otherwise he would also take away my salary (I know because he often does it with my mother and my brother). Furthermore, he is a traditional parent and expects me to get married in order to move away (even though he said that if I get married, my husband and I will have to live in the apartment next to theirs, to be able to control us). In any case, if I worked for him and wanted to go away on my own, getting married or not getting married, it will be impossible because he will certainly take my money away.



Now I ask you, is it better to take a risk with the VAT number or give in to what he tells me, because this story has been going on for years and I'm exhausted, now I'm also afraid of not being able to go on except with his help. The funny thing is that he says he gave me so much, when they literally use me like a slave who has to do everything for everyone and they didn't even let me finish my studies.

"Hello, I'm 17 (F) & from the PH with no close friends or family. CPS or staying at another's home is not an option for me.

My parents are controlling & selfish, more or less. I was sheltered, never taught to do things, then chided for it when I can't do said things & it starts to inconvenience them. I don't know how to commute, manage finances, make a bank account, you know the shit.

My father in particular, prioritizes making me massage his head & back daily before he sleeps. That should tell you where their priorities lie with parenting me.

And I'm constantly yelled at just to be called, spoken to like a child by having overexplained instructions. Yet I'm reamed if I do the former to them, being told hy my father *""When we respect you, you respect us 2×!""*

I'm aware of what I need to do by now, but my reluctance, fear, & lack of headstart is leaving me lost. Advice and input is much needed and much appreciated. Thank you."
"Hi so I won't tell my life story as it's incredibly long 

In a nut shell my mum was mentally broken by a 15yr marriage with my dad (a narcissist) which left her emotionally and physically unavailable for her kids, which I somewhat understand . 

She did neglect me , I didn't have a dentist I didnt have baths regularly brush my teeth most the time she didn't know where I was and I walked myself to school from 6years old . She never told me she loved me or hugged me what I was beautiful ect she was very distant.  My dad left when I was 10 which was a blessing and a curse . 

Anyway I become extremely angry and emotionaly abusive to my mum as I got older which I later learnt was reactive abuse . 

Fast forward a good 15 years I'm almost 30 have a child of my own and a good relationship and I've somewhat made leave with my past me and my mum are amicable we don't have a ""mother daughter relationship "" and we only see eachother it seems when we need something which makes me more angry because I've just always craved a motherly relationship. The way I am with my child i tell her what she means to me every single day . 

Which makes me blow up the anger just comes back . 
Just recently it was my birthday she said happy birthday via Facebook messenger and my daughter went to her hoise on my birthday when I saw her in person she didn't say a word about my birthday absoloutly nothing (which isnt the first time ) which made me hurt and realise how much she will never love me all over again . I held it in for a few months a cried it out alone , but yesterday I asked her if I could have some birthday money but she already owed me money for something so she gave me what she owed me and said it was my birthday present , we argued back and forth that she owed me money this was not a present . And from there I blew up f**** top . 

I told her she neglected me she's a f***** terrible parent .
Two of her kids have left her and her last one will to all because she refuses to take any accountability . I really dug into her and I was shouting at the top of my lungs . 
She kept blaming my dad over and over again like she always does. 

Anyway the point of this post is , how the f do I stop this ? The birthday scenario was a trigger point clearly and I'm allowed to me mad at how I was treated but the way I lay into her is absoloutly unacceptable, I have become emotionally abusive towards my mum . I say I have forgiven her but when it comes up it appears I never will . It hurts so much and this happened Infront of my daughter to which I am so upset about . I ended up crying my heart out while my dsughter held me she's 7 she dosent need to see that. Luckily she's a very empathetic kid and she said it's ok mum we all need to let our emotions out . 

My daughter is mildly aware of how my mum has treated me now , which is shit because she has a good relationship with my mum (her nanny ) and I really hope it dosent Tarnish it . 

I studied psychology and I understand most of it but I can't seem to thathom why I still do this . And I'm heavily considering the fact I may have BPD."
"For starters, my dad is an alcoholic and drug user. Ive lived in Utah since 2021 with him and recently got kicked out of the house at 17. I went to a friends house, called her up, and she got me a flight back to California. My dad filed a thing in court trying to enforce me out of her home but I am scared. Yes, I’ve contacted DCFS, they havent done shit. And I am terrified of going back to my dads house. Any help? My parents have court next week. There’s also a video recording of my younger sister recording the incident where he kicked me out. "
"I was in a car accident and it made my anxiety so bad when it comes to driving I'm scared to drive I don't have a license. I'm stuck living with my mom who treats me like a sack of shit. It's fucking horrible we live in a basement apartment so space is tight, we've moved a lot because my mom gambled away our house and nearly bankrupted my father. I always like to think things were worse when I was younger but it's happening again. my mom had no money and I was only able to bathe 1-2 times a week as a child which led to some serious hygiene and self-esteem issues when I was younger. I'm 21 and it's happening again, I think she's really losing it. I get screamed at if I have a bath and she blames me for the mold problem in the house. she keeps telling me I'm not allowed to have a bath and she will take away the drain plug and the towels if I do so. Although I couldn't care less It is so frustrating. Aside from that, I am yelled at from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep, I am not a bad person and I'm rarely home I work go to school and volunteer 2 days a week through my school program. It fucking sucks I try so hard to do everything and all she does is bring me down I'm on the dean's honours list and she doesn't care she just gets mad that my dad saved money for me to go to school and that could have been money in her pocket. I hate to think that things were bad but they were. She used to leave me in the hotel room for hours when I was younger little did I know I would lose my home to the casino and never really feel like I'd have one again. I'm rambling now.

Anyway, I'm stuck in my room I'm not allowed to have anything of my belongings including me outside of it. I slept for over 14 hours yesterday after work when I meant to take a nap my mom came home from work and I woke up to her yelling at me I was just so tired of it that I went back to sleep. it's so overwhelming I can't escape her she follows me around yelling she will unlock the bathroom door to yell at me. She sends me really rude texts it just becomes so out of hand, that I want to move far far away and never come back. I don't know if I would feel so guilty (The mental abuse played a role in my social anxiety). But I think about it and realize parents get mad but this isn't normal. We used to snap the wood off doors because I would stack my things and put my feet on the door just to keep her out of my room because she would chase me screaming and calling me a whore ( I was 12-13). I can't name a day where she hadn't yelled at me she ran out of things to yell about so today when I told her to shut up she just opened my door and called me a fucking cunt 4 times. Everyone always says ignore her and to not say anything but I can't anymore there is NO ONE to defend me and I was quiet for so long but it didn't help she would follow me and get in my face until I said something she even taunts me to hit her ( I never have but it takes a lot when she's in my face). I don't even know I just needed to rant I wish things were different I wish someone was there and could see what I've been through."
"OK reddit.....help me out here. Is this emotional abuse or am I overreacting? I'm using a throwaway because my friends + family know my main, but if anyone needs to verify anything with me let me know.

First point - I am an adult female in my own place, name is on the lease. My mom lives with me because of a very long story that's semi irrelevant to this. One thing that irks me is that she says that she got me this apartment. She was the one who 'forced' me to call places until something sprang up, and seems to want to take credit for the entirety of getting me in this apartment. This is a red flag to me.

Second point - She went through my phone and forced me to commit chargeback fraud on over FIFTY PEOPLE and has NOT apologized for it whatsoever, and said she'd 'do it again'. I had to do severe damage control and lost all my friends due to another long story. She still has to 'help' me pay bills because my idiotic actions left me without a stable bank account, but I'm fixing it, slowly.

Third point - Combining one and two she is so surprised I dislike her. I should mention my dad is not in the picture but he is alive. They don't speak. Anyway what stirred me to make this post is that she USED CHATGPT to essentially imply that I don't have a personality, and when I talked to her about it, she said I was nitpicking small details and gaslighting her. She also says IM abusive because I 'use her and treat her like shit' in her words.

[Here's the afromented screenshot.](https://gyazo.com/0b156334e96ad16309733a18ea904b12)

I am...floored. Is she abusing me emotionally or just very mean? I'm not saying I've been a saint but here's some other things she does - 

1. Throws my dad under the bus because he left when I was 5

2. Constantly gets upset that I treat my dad 'better' than I treat her

3. Called me a patient instead of her daughter

4. Guilt trips me constantly because I don't act like a friend to her

5. Gets upset when I don't get her gifts for holidays, despite her proclaiming several times how much she dislikes her birthday + holidays + materialistic things. When I do something handmade, she complained that it wasn't as good as what I do for myself, so I stopped altogether.

6. Vents to me about her job and her personal friends instead of getting therapy

7. Constantly negs me about my appearance (I have depression and a physical disability as well as mental illness so some stuff I just get worn out doing like my hair, I'm working on it)

8. Any time I am genuinely happy she tries to fuck with me mentally (ie - I was friends with a lot of artists before the chargeback fraud and now no one speaks to me because it was through me that it happened).

I could go on. But she does a lot of good for me too like got me through school and helping me write e-mails to succeed in places I flounder (I struggle socially because of autism too) and without her I couldn'tve done a lot, but I feel worse around her than I do better, and I want to make sure I'm not acting entitled or out of my mind."
"For reference I am a 14 year old boy not super young but also not a super rebellious and angsty teen. My whole life I've grown up in a house with screaming and a single parent who threatens me and calls me things such as scumbag, piece of shit ect. Basically my father is on all sorts of medications because he's insane I'll talk about what he does later in this but for now I'll explain why I can't help myself if I tried. My mom is having trouble looking for a place to live and having me would make it harder to find a place because of her limited budget and time to find a place with enough room because I'm not small or anything I'm the size of a grown adult finding a place with another bedroom could make it more complicated especially considering there's already two toddlers she's trying to take care of with barely any money. And I could not contact CPS because there's no place I could go because all ties with most family are cut so there's no one around here who could take me in if anything happened. Stuff at home is rough my father who is on enough medication to be considered a clinical drug addict lashes out over stuff I didn't do or stuff that he's usually fine with but just changes up. For example he lost something and bought a replacement but then he found it some time later and asked me"" so where was it because it wasn't here before"" . Mind you I did not touch it or anything else that he was accusing me of but he refuses to believe me based off of his own delusions I am scared and concerned so I ask ""are you off your meds"" and he says ""no but maybe if you were on some you would be normal"" he says this even though he has been given the option to get medication for my ADHD but was just too lazy to fill paperwork or pick it up. He continues to blame stuff on me and lash out even though he was there when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (likely caused by my living environment) along with my recent diagnosis of autism. He also knows about my struggles with SH and suicidal thoughts. So it's not like he doesn't know how what he does can affect me he just doesn't care. He yells at me with two of my friends upstairs and yells at them to go home even though I didn't do anything and he just messed up but refuses to believe it. This is getting kind of long so I'll make a list of things he has done 

Pushed / shoved me into walls, onto the floor and outside in front of other people

Whipped me with my own clothing such as heavy pants and coats 

Spit in my face 

Raised his hand at me just to get me to flinch 

Yells at me ""shut the fuck up"" whenever I try to help with the situation where he's yelling at my brother 

Messes up my room just to tell me to clean what he did 

Makes me stop everything I do just to grab him some alcohol which is a couple steps away 

Break my belongings just to see me upset about it 

Destroy or take away stuff that other people got for me

Threatened to take away everything I care about and get rid of any communication with the people I care about such as my friends and my girlfriend 


The list goes on but I don't have much longer to type so I'll cut it here

"Today I randomly remembered something that happened when I was a kid. I was in the car with my family and I was crying about something I don't remember. My Dad told me if I didn't stop crying, he'd break my finger. He told me how easy it would be and how no one would know it was him because kids break bones all the time. Is this normal for a parent to say? Or is it messed up?"
"Hello. I’ll try to cut it short.
I (18f) told my mother (41) that i disliked the fact her boyfriend (45ish ?) enters my room when i didn’t allow him to. He knocks once or twice and enters right away, i don’t even get the time to cover up if i’m dressed lightly. It’s summer and i like to sleep in light clothing but wouldn’t want anyone to see as my room is supposed to be my private space…

When i told her about this issue, that he comes in uninvited and i could be changing or coming out of the shower, she just yelled at me. Told me that being on the phone with my bf at night is also disrespectful. That living with me is impossible because i want everyone to treat me like so deity (for wanting intimacy.) She told me to go marry my bf and live with him at this point (my mother is probably a narcissist, if i ever try to leave she will stalk me like a wolf does to a prey and will probably try to drag me in the house and make me pay.) But the issue is, i’m just telling her that her man’s behaviour a but inappropriate towards me ? And i mentioned that she once told me if any men even hers has some bad behaviour with me, she’ll do something about it.
But all she did was yell at me, made some sarcastic comments (”alright, when he’ll get back home i’ll stab him. Are you happy ?”).
She even left the room to stop listening to me and said that if i didn’t shut my mouth and leave right away, she’ll break my skull in half. 
Man, i just wanted for my mother to hear me, why does she have to choose this random disgusting guy ?"
"wanna start and say this is more of a rant to get this off my chest. I am autistic and spent 14 years in foster care (age 6-20) my mother has always been a POS she got pregnant at 13 with a 20yo man and when I was 2 she took me away from my grandmother (who was raising me) to live with that man. she has always been a heavy smoker/drinker and I would often get beaten for very mundane things like being too loud. So eventually I got put in foster care. Fast forward to 2016 residential I was in made me fly from PA to FL for a week to visit my mother and when my trip was almost up they call us and say if I come back I would be homeless. so now I’m stuck in a state with my abuser with no work experience. None
Of my paperwork nothing to my name except my PS4 I saved for for several years. Stay with my mother for about 2 weeks before she has an episode and my grandmother pays for a plan ticket for me to fly to her in New Mexico. My grandma is an amazing person and I would not be here today without her she truly goes above and beyond for me. Fast forward to about 2020-2021 my grandmother has to have a spinal fusion so my aunt and her husband let us move into their house. 2023 my mother fucks up her life again and my aunt has her move in with us under 1 condition. No drinking. Aaaand she drinks in less than a week. my aunt unfortunately gives her a second chance. my grandmother at this point is staying in a mother in law apartment section of the house and me in a guest bedroom while my mother stays in a RV in the back yard. My mother wants that apartment though and begins the drama she nit picks at everything my grandmother does and when she gets fed up and claps back my mother plays the victim this goes on for 3 days then around 9:30 pm she calls the cops accusing my grandmother of trying to kill ME. my grandmother scared for her life at this point moves out and can’t take me with her because she is living with a friend. Grandmother tells my mother she has to take some responsibility and help me now (I don’t drive) she doesn’t like that so her mission for the next 4 months is to get me to snap. she nit picks everything I do. tells me “U need to show more respect. You’re this close to living on the steet” “you’re aunt doesn’t deserve the stress” mind you I
Mostly keep myself and stay in my room and rarely talk to anyone so she has to find any little thing to have a problem with. My grandma finally help me find an affordable housing apartment and it will take 3 months at least for all the paperwork to go through. my mom tells me to text her when I get back and she’s furious that I found a place I can be successful in. I text my mother I’m home. And she goes off texting me for 3 hours and every other text “I need to go to work tomorrow” and now she’s talking shit about my grandmother “did you know she wanted to sell u on the black market? That’s why I ran away “ frustrated from the text I got and knock on her door to tell her to stop and granted I knocked harder then I should have because I’m tense and the first this she says is “WHAT THE FUCK! IM CALLING THE POLICE” I call her a cunt and leave and she’s screaming for help making a scene. My aunt come out of her room and says wtf is going on. and I tell her. I have to go back into the mother in law apartment to get a drink for my meds and I hear my mother talking on the phone with my aunt saying I’m outside her door trying to break in. I call her out and at this point I call my grandmother saying I want to get a restraining order because all the BS. Next day my aunt tell me I need to move out. I spent the next month in a shitty cockroach infested motel waiting and praying for the apartment to get approved and it did. I am now week 3 of living in my own place and my grandmother lives about 20 minutes away and checks up on me. if you read through this whole post thank you for listening to my rant and if any has any questions about my time in foster care or other things my mother has done or wants any advice ill try my best to answer"
"There’s a lifetime of things I could give for context of my dad, but essentially my dad is extremely selfish and I don’t doubt that he cares for me and my family but that’s overshadowed for his desire to fill his own pockets (that are filled with millions of dollars as well as two million+ dollar homes). Also, in 2021 my dad bought a very nice 2016 F-150 for 39k that just sits at our vacation place (soon to be where my parents move to for retirement)

So, right now our car situation leaves us with a 2021 infinity suv for my mom, a 2011 ford escape for my brother (22 and in college but taking the year off) a 2022 ford escape for my dad and a 2011 ford explorer for me (16M). However, my dads car is a company car that he’s going to lose when he retires in a couple weeks, as he is 66. He’s been telling me that he’s going to be sharing a car with me and if I have to I’ll drive my brother’s car at times. My mom and I are livid because this does nothing but create problems for us as I would constantly be going to school, which means no car for somebody from 6:45AM to 2:45PM, but the main reason we’re pissed is because my dad could literally drive the truck he payed 39k for but chooses not to. I’m also pissed because my dad has enough money solicit him think about buying an old Porsche for himself, and he constantly tried to paint me as an entitled brat for expecting me to have my own car. I just think that when a parent has as much money as him a child really should have their own car, especially in a situation where if he drives his truck I would get a car without him paying a dime.

Also, it’s worth noting that the explorer has doo doo resale value as it’s 2011 with 200k+ miles on it with a replaced engine that has 80k+ miles on it, so it’s not like he could sell it for a lot if that’s what he’s worried about. Am I right to be upset?  "
"I was litterally studying from 6:10 to 8:30, and then when I came on the computer to study for my computer science practicals exam, my dad came, and he started beating and scolding me for being on the computer the whole day and not studying. I already studied using books a few minutes before, but then I was studying for my computer practicals, I was litterally studying, yet he doesn't want to listen to anything. "
"My mum has neglected me my entire life, she’s also been emotionally and physically abusive at other times but the prevalent theme is her being neglectful. 

She also gets so annoyed with me that I can’t do apparently easy tasks but it’s not like she’s ever shown me how to do it. She gets annoyed if I forget to clean up after myself but she rarely ever cleans anything, I have had a really bad unhealthy diet but she’ll belittle me for any attempt at improvement and it’s not like she eats healthy at all or anything. 

Like sorry I don’t know how to regulate my own emotions in a healthy way, I had to talk my own mother out of suicide multiple times before the age of 7.

The worst thing is is anything I somehow manage to find success in, she’ll brag to people she knows about how good a parent she is. I’ve not been successful at holding down a job because I got raised well, I’ve been successful at holding down a job because it’s my only potential way out.  She’ll take credit for my own accomplishments, but won’t acknowledge how much more difficult she’s made my life by just bothering to teach me anything

"Mom just came up and told me we are leaving at 7:30. It's 6 right now. 

I DO NOT want to go to school! What do I do? I don't want to go! What the fuck do I do????!!!! I'm panicking!!!! 

It's still pitch black outside, when mom was paying on the door like a fucking psychopath, I thought I was dreaming. 

I asked mom if she was going to go and help me get my bus schedule and my class schedule because we still don't have it and school is today, or if she was going to abandon me, and she said she was going to call the school at seven, and if I have my bus information by then then I'm getting on the bus by myself and then I'm going to the office at the alternative school by myself and getting my schedule all by myself. I told her that she's basically abandoning me, and fucking said, ""oOh. YoU'Re 18 AnD CaN GeT A ScHeDuLe yOuRsElF."" 

I just got up and fucking left after that. 

She thinks that just because I'm 18 now, I can literally do everything by myself. I think she genuinely believes that now that I’m 18, I am suddenly capable of doing EVERYTHING by myself, and I am no longer mentally ill. She CLAIMS to not have Narcissistic Personality Disorder, but I'm 99% sure that she does. She's always comparing me to herself, and how she was able to do everything on her own. The only way she's capable of doing everything on her own was 18 was because her parents kicked her out SEVERAL times, she had, like, 4 jobs at once, and she was pregnant and forced to get married to a man she hated. She was a dumbass teenager, which is forced to grow up too early, and now she blames me for her own scars. 

Because of my autism, ADHD, and whatever other undiagnosed mental illnesses I can’t mature in a mental senes. I've tried so hard to like an adult—to be very mature—but no matter what I do, I still feel like a little kid. People still tell me I'm super immature for my age. I don't think I CAN grow up.

My social anxiety is eating me alive! I don't even know what to do! I just want to curl up in a ball in the corner and cry! "
"My mom has anger issues and says a ton of horrible things when ever she is slightly inconvenienced for example: one morning was complaining about my ocd and how I wasn't sure if I could go to school and she said ""just kill yourself"" she also often threatens to hurt me but never acts on it and threatens to leave my dad and live her own life away from us. There's a lot more but I think that these stories highlight the majority of it."
"I'm 20F. I've posted on this sub before, just to vent out. if anyone wants, it's on my profile to read (might give some context as to relationshis w dam and sibling) :l 

So here I am once again. all I can say is that it's getting worse. I don't know.

My sister has been supportive surprisingly. We had a few talks over the course of 7 months and realised where we both were wronged and have been learning to communicate properly w each other and be nice (ish). she's gotten to the point of ignoring my mother when she starts talking shit (which is a lot btw). and occasionally defends me if it's too serious. during a recent visit to my sister's place, my sister realised I'm not as useless as my mom and dad project, and when I have something to do I do it without complaints or anything like that. I'm also patient and stuff. we did have a few arguments but for the first time in our lives we communicated through it and sorted it without it turning serious. my sister claims her therapist also noted that we communicate properly or at least better when our parents, specifically our mother isn't around which I was happy about.

I honestly don't know what structure this post is following. I tried to have a secret journal to write all this in and my mother found it, burnt it, and then yelled at me for a week. I didn't eat for 4 days straight and lived on water alone because she also locked me outside the house for those days. I slept outside in the garden w my cats blanket that my mother had kept to throw out. neighbours didn't give a fuck before anyone asks. abuse is normal in this country. moving on.

i don't know how to handle this anymore. minor trigger warning but i constantly have the urge to self harm or harm someone else now. I'm forgetting a lot of things in my day to day life, such as words, actions, etc. physical symptoms wise i seem to keep putting on weight, not losing a single kg, yet I eat normally (I work in sports so nutrition is key). no amount of excercise, meal planning, etc is helping. My tolerance level for loud noises, etc has reduced a LOT, making me extra sensitive to everything. My grades are decentish last semester, but i have no hope of going anywhere with those (7.48/10 gpa). I also seem to have little to no hope for the future. this country doesn't allow for working opportunities to earn until post graduation unless it's small time jobs like assistant in a small tea shop, etc. i can't save the money i have from scholarships because my mother makes me spend it for stuff for her. without money I can't survive on my own since I have no support, no skills, etc. So I can't move out either. my graduation major requires a master's degree minimum if I need to work in that field, which is also fucked up but understandable. i don't know what to do anymore because life is becoming very bleak and I'm close to running out of hope for life. 

My mother still maintains a sparkling image outside the world, so I don't even know how to approach anyone about this either. being well established doesn't work in my favour here.

Yeah. I'm currently hiding out and writing this, hence the lack of structure. "
"i'm an 18 yo guy who lives in an arab household, life's been fine until my religious parents accidentally discovered that i left religion, and ever since then they never looked at me the same, they started blaming the phone, put a family link on it and started restricting me from using many apps i like on it cuz apparently people on there are hired specifically to convert people out of religion and all this dumb conspiracy theory stuff, its been months and im still not free to live my life, i even got called names and beaten and threatened to get kicked out, but they guilt trip me in such a way that idk who's in the right and wrong"
",,, I wish he knew how much words hurt.. I wish he loved me enough to care about my mental health. I wish he didn’t mentally abuse my mom. All he cares about is money and my school, but he does not care about my success. No you got that super wrong, he cares so when i get my job he can live off my money and success. All he does is yell and complain. I wish he was back to the dad i liked always making me and my mom happy actually works hard and doesnt yell. He was never like this. He randomly became a deadbeat . I wouldn't be a person who likes games. Most of the time he doesnt let me outside and when outside he has cameras on me.   He is the reason why I'm disrespectful. He is the reason why I like to be at school more than home. And when he gets what he wants he pretends to be a happy person and like nothing happened. If he was not here my mom and I would be happier.

"I moved away a few months ago and left my little sister. Today she called and told me about last night. That there was the same old stuff between my parents. Yelling, throwing things, screaming, leaving the house, and threats. They pulled her into it and she hasn't been put in that kind of situation alone, usually I was there to keep her out of it. She was forced to ""pick a parent"" at 3am because they decided to divorce (this is a regular occurrence). I told her not to worry and that those irrational decisions and threats aren't the real thing, to pick what ever she feels safest with (picking the abuser if that's safer at the moment) since the next morning would be 'better' and she would be left with the reprucussions of her choice from the night before. I told her the real final decision is where others (lawyers, social worker, CPS, whatever it is) would be involved in the actual final decision. I think that helped put her worries to rest.

It hurt because I wasn't there to help her. I got away from that shit and left my favorite person on the planet behind. I feel guilty. I want to become a self reliant and stable adult so when she is older she can move in with me. But right now I can't do much and it's painful. 
After the phone call I literally cried. 

Any other siblings understand this? "
"What is or was your worst trauma response, and if you've gotten over it, how did you do it?

Mine is this: If anyone in the room or house is angry, I feel like it's directed at me, and that I need to 1- immediately leave 2- rectify it somehow if I can or 3- make myself smaller, don't make eye contact, and for the love of God pray they don't see me and direct any of their rage towards me. 

I'm slowly getting over this by reminding myself that their problems aren't my fault and I don't need to fix it. The immediate reaction is still Fight  Flight  or Fawn though. I'm seeking ways to try and move along. "
"I don't even know where to begin or if I even have the energy to type at all

I'm so tired of my mums abusive boyfriend both physically and verbally and how it effects me, how I can't stand to be around him, how she does not care about how I feel at all. How my family do not care and how she spins it to make it look like I'm lying etc 

I'm so exhausted, now homeless and just want to die"
"I'm 15F and I do PR reviews, I was using my mom's laptop to reply to some business emails in a private tab. She came over, Snatched the laptop and started yelling about how I can't do anything right. Prior to this I completed all my work and chores, she said I could use the laptop. She was pissed about it for NO REASON. She knows I do PR reviews and doesn't have a problem with it. (surprisingly.) 

Now I can't reply to important emails and she's just yelling at me for nothing, idk what to even say to her. She also went through my emails."
"I have an extremely abusive father mentally , physically and verbally. Growing up was very bad he would take everything out on me as I’m the  oldest daughter and child in the house , so a lot of exceptions come with that . My whole life have been bad with him , I feel like I’m on constant edge ,every-time he touches me , talks to me  even looks at me tiggers me . I’m 19 years old , been looking for a job so I eventually move out of this places , but no where is taking me so im stuck  and I can’t do anything about it , he makes me feel sick to my stomach , living with him makes me feel sducidal I remember ever since being a little girl feel like I’m in this cage , I’ve been going to therapy which has kinda helped but the abuse keeps on getting worse . 

I feel bad for my mom she’s been with him for the last 20 years , I couldn’t imagine being with someone who’s bad as him for 20 YEARS , every-time she says shes gonna leave him but look where we are it’s like she’s attached to him , at some point it got draining listening to her complain about him , it’s like you can leave , she says if I Leave him he want Pay for what I want or bs like that .

I ran away the last time he hit me , this man nearly killed me I look at the pictures of myself I didn’t even recognise myself , when he hit me  I went to the police , but they didn’t do anything they said “ bc I’m over 18  , you can help yourself “  so I had to go back home eventually but the panic attacks never stop  so I called them again they didn’t show up my COUSIN called them and told them not to come ,like come ON , how can she say “ you deserve what he did to you , he should’ve done more “ this can not be okay , it feels like I’m living in my own horror story over and over on constant replay , every-time I think things get better they don’t it get WORSE . I wanna get a job and move out then cut them off , part of me will regret that but I can’t , maybe eventually our relationship would get better but for now gotta have it this way . "
My sperm donor stopped speaking to me over 20 years ago when I sued him for my college fund. I think the money was mostly from my mom's side of the family when I was born and a little before the divorce when I was 5. He even had to pay my attorney fees because court was not necessary. My paternal grandmother passed away August 17th and had turned 100 in June. I was at her party and despite no contract with him speak to his sisters and mother. My sister called me when grandmother passed away. I was also send texts from aunts. Then when the 3 children are discussing when to have service the day I said was not good for me was chosen. So I have to rearrange my plans to be there. He also was putting my sister in the middle and it caused tension in my back that day. Now I found out each aunt is having one of their kids give a reading but neither my sister or I were asked. It also feels like when I was little my sister and I weren't included in great grandmother funeral but the other kids were. The service happened the day before we came up for Thanksgiving.  Am really frustrated and am preparing a speech to reveal the abuse. None of the the grandchildren besides my sister and I know our grandmother was abused by her husband. I tried when I sent everyone letters after the drama with my sisters wedding and talked about my parents divorce was because of his abuse. I guess no one else realizes the abuse runs in families cycle. I did research on this as a kid because mom would say sperm donor was sick and I wanted to know how can he get better. 
"Not going into great specifics. I’ve been getting verbally abused my whole life. It has always been horrible. Lately though I guess it’s been a little less intense, but still really bad. For some reason now I get really sad, angry, and cry when it happens. I used to do/feel these things way less before from it. Why? Why am I like this now?"

"I (16 yo nb) am a single child, my mother is an abusive person, everyone around me in my life agrees and I wish it wasn’t this way. To paint a picture of who she is: she tried to choke me to death when I was 11, threatened to kill me 3 times as a child, tries to cut me off from other people, knew about and allowed an ex bf to abuse and s/a me, she will constantly take her anger out on me by screaming at me about her problems as if it’s my fault and then punishes me just because she’s having a bad day. She once took all my belongings because I had an apple in my room, one time she beat me just because I came home, ext. Last week I had school orientation at a new school, students and parents where directed into separate places, I followed instructions of my teachers the whole time, my mom later screamed at me because I didn’t follow her or the schools directions on where to go, even though I very much so did and other students who where with me confirmed that I in fact did exactly as told. Instead she refused to listen and took my phone and then screamed at me the whole car ride, she said I’m useless and she hates me, I’m a disappointment and can’t do anything, she went on and on for about 5 hours still yelling at me not even about the subject just purely insulting me. 
I don’t feel safe in my home and I moved over the summer so now I have no irl friends and don’t know what to do or where to go. I hate my family and this house I feel trapped and scared all the time. What do I do?"
"i’m 20f. my childhood wasn’t really ‘bad’.

i’ve had a mum and dad present throughout my life. they divorced when i was a baby so i’ve never seen them in love which definitely affected me.

my mum had several partners when i was growing up. i would always grow attached to these men and then they’d leave, so i have really bad abandonment issues now.

one of my mums husbands used to shout at me and really scare me. my mum would get drunk and run away and my step dad would scream at me asking where she is. i had no idea. one time, he got really angry at dinner and shouted and smashed his plate on the floor. i was always terrified of him. i could not stand up for myself or speak my mind because i was afraid of him.

my mum rarely stood up for me. and neither she nor my dad have ever really been emotionally available. i don’t think my dad has ever hugged me, but he’s never been abusive to me. he’s just a bit emotionally distant.

my mum has said some really hurtful things to me. 
- when i was a child, she rarely hugged me when i cried. she usually just exasperatedly said ‘why are you crying?’ to which i often didn’t have an answer as i couldn’t express myself because she’s never created a safe space for me to be emotionally vulnerable with her!
- a few months ago i went through a really difficult breakup and i travelled home from uni because i needed some comfort. she didn’t hug me. she didn’t even pick me up from the train station - i had to ask my friend to. when i was crying the whole time, she told me to ‘get a grip’ and ‘stop crying’ and ‘get over it.’
- that is pretty much her approach to every time i cry.
- she has always compared me to my friends, or her friends kids, and made me feel like i’m not good enough. 
- she has said i’m ’not normal’ for wanting to come home from uni in the holidays instead of staying there alone. 
- every time i come home, she makes me feel unwelcome by complaining about having to buy food for me.
- whenever i have tried to talk to her about how she has hurt me or affected me, she either denies / refuses to acknowledge my emotions or just starts guilt tripping me and says ‘i’m a bad mum’

so yeah i am just wondering if any of you would consider any of that emotional abuse. i’m not sure it’s really bad enough to be considered abuse but it has defo affected and hurt me"
"I have a “friend” whom I have told about the horrible things said to me and the psychological games played on me. She asked a question the other night that was “you weren’t locked in a room and beaten were you?” Her intent being the lifetime of being told by my parents that I’m stupid, I’m ugly, and even more grotesque things, them hiring people to terrorize me, them playing psychological mind games on me, them giving my now 62 y/o sibling EVERYTHING so she never has had to work a minute in her life, is not anything to be bothered about. Is she wrong or am I for being frustrated, and more, about what has been done to me?"
"I'm (f) 19 yrs old as of now,  still dependent on my family financially as they never let me do anything I want and also the country I live in does not have a lot of opportunity for women. I was 8 y o when I was first SA'd by my 22 y.o. cousin, he did it multiple times, which at that time, I didn't understand but it still affects me to this day bcoz I never got support for it from the people I expected it the most. He tells me it's my fault and tells me to file a case if I have so much problem with it, but I can't since it's been years and I have no evidence obviously. He sleep deprives and also deprives me of any proper food. To add fuel to the fire, my mother is also a narcissist, although she was physically abused by my father too, she likes it when the same happens to me. Half of the times she is behind all the abuse I have to suffer. She lies to my father, makes him believe things that I never did, so that he abuses me. She also likes to harass me verbally and bully me. I'm writing after being overwhelmed by the abuse I was just suffering a min ago, writing this as tears flow down my face, as my full body aches from the beating. I hope I am able to run out and be free. Tbh I hope I just don't wake up tomorrow. "
"Help, my parents are getting more and more insane, this Summer has been a nonstop torture session from them, they don't let me go outside unless they chaperone and monitor every move, they force me to wear the most masculine clothes possible, every Sunday they make everyone slave off and I hide in my room to avoid it, they actively take me out on trips to do only what they want and trick me into thinking I'll be doing the stuff I want on top of that just so they can feel superior by restricting what I do and then gaslight me into thinking im abusive and hostile for wanting basic human rights, today alone they even blocked the door while they were making everybody else slave off in the hot sun so I couldn't sneak down for lunch meaning I was starving feeling like I was going to pass out from heat exhaustion, in just 3 days I'm being sent back to another year of this horrible Special Needs school full of delinquents and criminals where psychopaths and a literal criminal violent roadman incel harrass me, laugh at me and even call me slurs for how I look as well as my focusing problems I've developed over time from being trapped in my room for years, they even gaslight me into thinking I never said yes to a driving test when I said yes twice just so they can trap me into adulthood and have even tried to bribe me so I stay too, its absolute hell on earth, I'm scared even writing this thinking my parents might know about my reddit accounts existence, especially just a few days after my dad said ""Snitches get stitches"" quite aggressively when I stood up to my brother and told him what he was saying behind his back

"Hey y‘all. 
Really need to write down my feelings somewhere or else I will explode.
So my (17) mother is emotionally abusive and neglectful and has ruined my childhood permanently.
Not only is she abusive, but she‘s also a body-shamer. Especially when it comes to her children. My older sibling (21) and I both went through her harassment once we started puberty. Earlier she always made passive-aggressive comments when we „ate too much“ but she started outright body shaming us once we both reached the age of roughly 12 years old. I was slightly less fortunate than my older sibling (who stayed relatively slim during puberty), and gained quite a bit weight during puberty and my mother wouldnt let me forget. She always compared me to my older sibling and I couldn‘t eat anything remotely sweet. 

So I developed an eating disorder and ate only 1.5 meals a day for roughly 8 months. It got better eventually but even now I eat less than a „normal“ person.

Recently my younger sibling (12) turned 12. And obviously it‘s not enough for my mother that she already gave 2/3 of her children an ED, because she‘s working hard on making that a 3/3. She‘s been commenting relentlessly on how much my younger sibling eats and it‘s sickening. Today my little sister had ice cream for dessert and then she made herself a small glass of mint sirup (icky, if you ask me.)
My mother immediately told her off and warned her that she‘ll get fat. She said, quote : „Won‘t your ass explode from all this sugar?“ 
She said it in our native language, so the translation is slightly weird. 
And here‘s where it gets worse. She said the exact same fucking sentence to me for years with the exact same tone of disgust and it‘s killing me. How can someone birth three children and then hate their bodies so much.

I‘m terrified my little sibling will go down the same path I did and I hate my mother for even daring to say such a thing. 


So yea, I really needed to rant somewhere. 
Take care everyone and stay safe!!"
"The problem is my violent childhood, caused by my dad (he’s in prison). But i can’t help but wonder why my grandmother still thinks that my dad could possibly come and live with us (me, my siblings and my mother). Even after my dad tried to hit my mother with a car, my grandmother doesn’t realise how harmful he is to us. 

She obviously doesn’t want her son to be abandoned and alone when he comes out of prison, but i feel like she doesn’t even think about how we might feel. Does she really expect us to put up with such violence and aggression?

Shouldn’t a grandmother want the best for you? especially when it comes to safety?

This is what mainly bothers me. 

I’ve distanced myself for the last year but I miss my grandmother and I struggle with loneliness in general. 

I don’t want to be the reason that i don’t see my grandmother, but i feel so disrespected in her presence. Does she really expect her grandchildren to accept the violent actions of their father? 

I wish she could just be our grandmother instead of letting my dad come between us. 

What do you guys think? I don’t know how to feel entirely. 

We have had serious conversations about my dad before but it seems like my grandmother really wants my dad to live with us? How can she be okay knowing that we’re not living peacefully? 

For now, I’m planning on speaking to her in the future about all of this but i need y’all’s perspective. 

Do I think i know better than my own grandmother? Am I rude and ungrateful? Should i just forget about everything and pretend like everything is fine?

"So…I really don't know how to say this. For context: I'm 15F, my boyfriend is 16M and like every curious teenager we exchanged nudes. Now, I trust him with my life, we've known each other for years, he's the sweetest boy ever and he's different from others. I let him save my nudes and pictures of my face, just like basically every couple. My mother is very strict, my parents and religious and worst case scenario I get sent back to my home country. But the issue here is my dad knew I was talking to someone, he does have a problem with it but he never brought it up, my mom knows very well about my boyfriend.

THE PROBLEM:

My mom brought it up to my aunt who's also very religious, instead of taking care of me herself. Now this aunt basically raised me all my life, she looks at me differently after that.

I fell asleep with my phone opened, I have notifications on. My mom saw a notification from my boyfriend, it was an attachment of his haircut and facial hair trim along with “Here's before and after :)”

She. Went. Through. My. Entire. Phone.

She watched every single video that I sent to him, ndes and voice messages. EVERYTHING. and even worse, SHE WATCHED IT WITH MY AUNT. I feel like my privacy was invaded and I'm disgusted with her and my behavior.

She never had a normal discussion with me, she woke me up with a broom to my legs,face and arms while calling me a wh0re. I'm a sensitive person but I didn't start crying right away, I was just tired and wanted to sleep. I've always been this way, not an attention wh0re but I just wanted to feel loved because my parents aren't capable of that, my dad is too busy, my mom is too strict and rude for any fun, my brothers are assholes and my sister is still young. My only friend is my boyfriend and another friend, she's been with me for 7 years and I also trust her.

My mom explained how she watched everything and saw my boyfriends shirtless pics too. She read our dirty messages too. Everything. She sent him a voice message of herself saying “Don't ever message my daughter again”.

I'm not allowed to use any devices, my dad doesn't know about this and he gave me my phone for a bit but I'm so scared and weirded out, my aunt won't look at me the same, my mom thinks I'm a slvt and I texted my boyfriend and he comforted me right away. help??? What do I do????

Thank you so much I'm really struggling. :("
So my brother recently told my mom that when he has kids he’ll hit them when they don’t listen and that it’s normal to do that. My mom told him how he didn’t like it when she would hit him so why would he do that to his kids and he replied saying how he thinks my mom hit him for a good reason and that it’s good to hit your kids so they listen or else they don’t… I don’t know how to feel about this I’m scared for his future kids. I know my brother’s still young and he might change as he ages but I don’t know about that honestly he seems really violent now. He doesn’t listen to me either. He thinks his mature and the only one that’s right. What should I do? 
"As a little kid I wasn't allowed to cry. If I did I always heard ""if you want to cry I'll give you a reason to"" or something similar. I cried nearly every day, so I heard this very often. 
She constantly told me things like ""I'll slap you into next week/month/year."", "" I'll hit you so hard you forget your name."" and, ""you remember pain, not words."" She always said they were jokes or she wouldn't actually do that. 

I got/get slapped and screamed at for everything I did that was deemed wrong. Even if I didn't do anything, she never believed me. Typically my hand/face got slapped. But if it was ""bad enough"" she would also slap my butt. Several times did she make me start a shower/bath then slap me to make it sting more. If we were out she'd say she had to use the bathroom and make to come with. She would wet her hand then slap me. 

I got SA'd by a classmate(6 years ago) and I got in trouble for my clothes being cut. I got yelled at and slapped for it every day for a few weeks. And spent a month grounded. Nearly my whole life she has told me if I got assaulted I could tell her. I recently told her what happened again and she called me a lair and yelled at me for lying about something so major. 

She only acts like this when we're alone. Once someone else is there she is a ""perfect"" person. 

Now I get scared whenever someone is angry and I flinch whenever she raises her hand or suddenly gets close to me. I have had several panic attacks because of this and other things that she made me scared of.

A few months ago I mentioned her slapping me and she tried to make me think it didn't happen. Or it was just a dream I had.

I know this has a bunch of different things, but it's so you can see the whole picture. I thought this was normal up until early this year because my friend said how abusive this is. 

It this traumatic/abusive or am I overreacting to this all?"
"(P.s I have bad English) I am 15m who lives with my mom and dad who is underweight, haven’t used a shower for at least a week and I have not slept in a day, for my whole life and my mental has been degrading this year and with the recent starting of school to the point where I want to kill my self, my father acts abusive to me when he is at home but when he is out in public he acts like a saint, the abuse started when I was 7 he would usually hit me with his belt and sometimes give me spankings over the smallest things to the point where i would cry for almost a hour, he would threaten me when I couldn’t find something or break something and he would say stuff like “I will crack your skull open” or “I will beat your ass” and “I will disown you” and these threats he wouldn’t yell out constantly but I have been traumatized from theses threats, he would lash out at me for the stupid things like not doing my hair in the morning which I have been grounded for, not eating breakfast at school, having my mom help me with things I can’t do, and sometimes he would out right would call me stupid or a idiot for messing something up which caused me to be scared of him and sometimes he flat out would not feed me at all I get very little to eat which would probably explain why I am underweight the only safe place to me is school, I have talked to my school counselor about the problem and so far they haven’t done anything yet and I have no idea what I should do."
"TW: SA TRUAMA 
Hi y’all, so I have a situation here that I could use some advice on. I’m F21, and have three younger brothers and a very abusive birth mother and step father. Growing up in their house I endured more physical and emotional abuse than I ever knew was possible, it’s taken me years and thousands of dollars worth of therapy to start healing from. My step father SAd me from 3rd grade up until I was 18 years old and I left the house immediately, the only people who know are my paternal and maternal grandmothers, my maternal grandmothers husband, and my husband, besides them I have been to scared to tell anyone else about the repeated rape. However, I have since received custody of one of my brothers (my mother has brainwashed one of my brothers to hate me by saying I was manipulative and “brainwashing” my brother I have to hate them and make up abuse accusations against them and the other is to young to understand.) The brother I have hates his father (my step father) in a very similar way that I do and shows signs of sexual abuse, however, he says nothing has happened to him, and maybe it hasn’t, but I worry very much about him. There is a threat that he will be forced back in to the home with his parents, he doesn’t want that and neither do I. So I guess my question is, should I file charges on the repeated rape? In my state there is no statute of limitations on SA of a minor, and I worry that if I don’t they will put him back in the home with his parents and something very bad will happen to him. And maybe if I do finally come out about the abuse he will come forward as well if anything regarding SA has happened to him?….Im so lost on what to do and would really appreciate some advice or other perspectives….."
"A lot of people like to down play and normalize the abuse children go through while in living in Arab household. As do the children that are being abused, and there is a reason for this, the reason being it is hard to accept that, their parents, the people that are supposed to care for you the most, are actually the ones scaring you and hurting you, it's much easier to be in denial than face it with all the pain and heartbreak that doing so will entail, which is why they are so stuck on believing that this kind of treatment is a ""normal"" way to be treated, Which is just upsetting because everyone deserves to be respected and well treated by their parents."
"I had a dream I was being abused, I felt so much fear in the dream and I woke up crying and it made me think about the fear my siblings must feel towards my mom since she’s abusive (don’t worry she’s been reported by me and my therapist so hopefully something happens) and I just have been sobbing thinking about them and I feel so terrible and sad I just wish I could help them more"
Do things really get better? How much longer do I have to hold on? I know nothing's set in stone for anyone but will my hard work really pay off? What are the chances of me finally having a life I want to live?
"Ok I genuinely don’t know if my parents would be considered abusive but here’s a list of things they’ve done 

1. My dad dragged me out of bed and screamed at me to brush my hair because it was tangled (I was 7) 

2. My dad constantly calls me dummy 

3. He’s threatened multiple times to put me in a mental hospital why you ask because I cried (I had a hard day at work) 

4. A Blanket was left on the water heater (which can cause a fire) I wasn’t the one who left it there but I still got blamed my father said I was trying to 💀 the family… I tried to stand up for myself and he said if I kept talking he would hit me so hard with a belt the whole neighborhood would hear me scream (mind you I was 23 at the time) 
 
That’s only a few instances 



That’s only a handful of things I have loads more but we would be here all day   "
"TW: domestic violence and child abuse

Apologies for the long post. I just needed to get it out.

26f. I grew up with a stepdad who was emotionally abusive towards our whole house and physically abusive towards my mother. My mom met him when I was 2 and they had my 2 sisters and got married. When I was 8, we moved 12 hours away from all of our family so we could afford a better life. We went from living in a small apartment to a big, new house. Things got really bad after we moved. He would scream at my mom all the time and it got physical a handful of times. It didn’t happen everyday, but the few times that it did were insane and I constantly feared that it would happen again any time they fought. Just straight up punching her head over and over. The last time he hit her she almost died. My little sisters, in elementary school at the time, were in the car with them when my parents started fighting and he kept hitting her until she was able to get out of the car at a red light and run to the nearest store for help. I came home from high school that day to my stepdad sitting outside of our house, waiting for the cops to pick him up. 

There were a couple other times too and I was always scared about it happening when they’d start arguing. I’m the oldest child and always worried about what would happen if we lost my mom. I was worried that if I told anybody about the abuse, I’d move back to our home state to be with my paternal grandparents and my sisters would be taken to a foster home. I also wouldn’t tell my mom about the way he’d speak to me and make me feel when she was at work because I didn’t want her to be more stressed or risk her getting hurt by confronting him. It was a lot to handle as a kid. Luckily, after the incident I described above, he never hit her again. Except for the time when he whipped her with Christmas lights when they were putting up the Christmas tree a few years ago…

As far as my relationship with him goes, he was an awful stepparent. One time he told my to get my real dad, who was an absent addict, to get me food as he bought my sisters and himself Wendy’s but didn’t get me anything. He screamed at my sisters when they tried to give me some of their food. I was around 10. My mom was working at the time and yelled at him afterwards but obviously that didn’t change anything. As I got older he would never look at me or speak to me. It was like I didn’t exist. It fucked with my self esteem as a teenager and made me feel uncomfortable in my own home. It’s like that to this day when I see him. Except for the time about 5 years ago when my sister and I were fighting over a lipstick and he tried to intimidate me by barging into the room and yelling. I went chest to chest with him and said “What, are you going to hit me? Are you going to beat another woman?” Talk about empowering. Oh wait, actually he did scream at me over the phone last month when I was talking to my mom. I told her my psychologist diagnosed me with CPTSD because of the childhood trauma and he was screaming about how I’m crazy and that he didn’t do anything.

My sisters also despise him. He hurt them too. I’ll never forget when he left us at home to go to the store and it started snowing. We live in the south and it never snowed there like it had where we used to live. I was 12. I called my mom (she gave me a flip phone at that age because my stepdad wouldn’t always answer her calls and she needed to have communication with us if there was ever an emergency…) and I asked her if we could go outside. She said yes so we bundled up, so full of joy, and went out to play. We made snowmen and snow angels and had the best time. There wasn’t a ton of snow so we did go to the front yard after the back ran out of the good stuff. When my stepdad came home, he was enraged to find us outside. I told him that my mom said that we could but he didn’t care. Once we got inside I watched him pick up my sisters one after another by the hair, feet off of the ground, and hit their butts with full force. I didn’t know what to do so I ran upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom. After beating them he ran to where I was and banged on the door, telling me that I was next if I ever did that again. That really fucked all of us up. My mom defends him because his parents weren’t strict so he was just trying to be a good parent unlike what he had. She won’t acknowledge that it was abuse. After all, it was “just one time”.

I still visit my mom and my youngest sister at their house, where my stepdad also lives as they’re still married. It is so uncomfortable. I hate having him around but my mom and him have “worked it out” and my mom tells me that she has forgiven him and moved on and I should too. Maybe I could if I truly thought that he changed. It wouldn’t take away the trauma but maybe it would help. Although he doesn’t physically hurt her, he makes humiliating comments and is just a very disrespectful person towards my mother and youngest sister. I have no respect for him.

As one could expect, I have a lot of mental health issues. I am preparing to start my own family and I just started getting long overdue professional help because I absolutely will not continue this cycle of generational trauma with my own children. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, Complex PTSD, and depression.

I recently told a few of my family members on my father’s side about what happened to me. I did also say that he was physically abusive towards my mom, but I left out all of the details because I felt uncomfortable sharing her business. Nobody in our family knows anything about what happened and I’ve had this dark secret bottled up my entire life.

I did let my mom know that I shared this with them because I didn’t want her finding out by getting unexpectedly asked about it. She was angry with my and said that people were going to talk about her and call her a terrible mother.

The next day I called her again, literally sobbing, telling her that I don’t understand how she could love a man who has hurt us so badly. I have a psychological injury because of this person and she still is with him. If anybody looked at my DOG the wrong way I would cut them off, but she tolerates the emotional and mental damage that a man caused her children? I told her that it was her job to protect me and she didn’t. I understand that it is hard to get out of an abusive situation, but she was always the breadwinner and it was years of abuse that she’d just keep forgiving him for. The words “he only hit me twice” came out of her mouth and I was shocked. First, it wasn’t just twice. Second, we don’t let people do that and still be in our lives. What the actual fuck. She said I was being dramatic and that it happened a long time ago and she can’t believe that I’m still bothered by it. When I asked why she would stay with a man who refused to feed her child out of spite, she said she didn’t have to answer my questions. Then she told me that I’m only upset about everything because my dad died. My bio dad died of an overdose 2 years ago and that caused me a lot of pain, but it has nothing to do with this. She then said that the reason I can’t get pregnant is because I let other people affect me. How fucking disgusting? Although she says that my stepfather was absolutely wrong, she gaslights me and says I’m the one letting these things get to me and that I need to relax. That is fucking terrible.

I love my mother, but I wish that I had my old mom back. My siblings and I all agree that it was like someone flipped a switch after she almost got killed and she’s never been the same. She refuses to seek professional help even though she clearly needs it. When we don’t talk about our childhood, things are really great, but unfortunately this isn’t something that can be swept under the rug. I really feel like she chose this man over us, even though she doesn’t admit it and says that’s a stupid thing to say.

As I hope to become pregnant soon, the thing that I’ve worried about my entire life is what will I do when they want to see their grandmother? I’d like for her to be in their lives but my stepfather cannot. My mom says that he doesn’t have to be and that I can just pretend like he is dead…so he is going to be a secret from my kids? Or some weird man that is married to their grandma? I don’t want them around him at all. My kids will never have to feel uncomfortable around someone like I was with him. After the last conversation with my mother, I’m realizing that she’ll never leave him and I need to either accept my stepdad into my life (he doesn’t care for my either because I actually call him out) or I need to go low or no contact with my mom. I need this burden lifted from me. I grew up always being protective of my mother and I don’t want to lose her, but I can’t accept that she didn’t do her job to protect us and I can’t have my kids grow up with my stepdad in their bubble. I know that my mom wants me to move on because that’s what she has done. She doesn’t understand why I can’t forgive and let it go…I can’t let it go because I refuse to tolerate abuse and she’s lucky that that’s what I took from my upbringing rather than get into an abusive relationship myself. I’m just so lost. I’m seeing a therapist in 7 weeks so hopefully I can feel more at peace with a decision. 

My sisters are in the same boat. My youngest one is unfortunately still living with them but with most likely move in with my (amazing, sweet, and extremely loving) husband once she graduates next year. At least we have each other. I don’t know how my sisters and I would have survived without each other.

My mom always tells me to worry about myself and maybe I’ll be less anxious and depressed. I think it’s time to start taking her advice and distance myself from her. It just all hurts so much.

Thank you if you read this far."
"To all the family and people in my life that have tried to make me understand the POV of my abusive uncle, here’s what you should understand. 
“he’s a great guy and he’s trying his best. you could have ended up somewhere even worst. you have to admit you did give him a hard time, you were always troubled” 
this was said to me so much growing up that i thought “ok there is something wrong with me, i am troubled and bad” 
meanwhile 
he was screaming at me for spilling milk. yelling at me for being clumsy and dropping things like i intentionally did these things. 
for having an attitude when rly i was standing up for myself.
publicly humiliating me in grocery stores by punishing me with push-ups. 
pushing me so hard to lose weight that i would pass out from exhaustion and nearly heat stroke. 
threatening to send me away somewhere worst.
going behind my back to ask my school counselor what was talked about in sessions. 
my school counselor actually telling him bc she felt he should do better but only making it worst when i got home. 
never expressing love, never hugged me once unless i did 
for every thing i’ve ever done wrong, instead of being taught why it was wrong, i was taught to be bad and sneaky but better each time. 
making me eat food off the floor with my mouth to the ground if i dropped anything. making me eat huge amounts of food and mocking me just to prove a point that i would eat anything. 
telling my family about my weight issue so that they would secretly take me aside and give me weight loss tips. 
making me do push-ups on asphalt when it’s 100 degrees out. 
spending the night outside for hours because i forgot to take the trash out before bed. 
making me write ten page essays on why i am a bad kid and how i plan to do better… without having the tools to do so. 
tying us up in the shed as a “scenario” in case we were kidnapped but then leaving us there for hours. 
literally dividing me and my younger sister so now we’re adults who rarely want to talk to eachother. 
having me repeat after him how worthless i am and how a waste of air my mom was. 
i mean he had us repeating a mantra almost everyday, “i’m worthless and a waste of air”. he blended my food in a blender and made me eat it bc i went through a phase where i liked mixing certain foods together. 
he made me feel like i was gross for being a tomboy and made me wear dresses. 
fat shamed me endlessly to the point that i developed an eating disorder. 
always found a new way to insult my existence. 
putting tape on my door when i was grounded so he’d know if i left the room. 
grounding me to my bedroom for months at a time. 
taking away my books bc it was the only thing i had left to enjoy and that he hadn’t taken away yet.
gifting me my own things on christmas that he’d taken away as punishment before. 
yes teenagers are moody but i was especially bc of how wrong i knew i was being treated. ugh. i walked on egg shells for most of my adolescence and you have the nerve to tell ME i was troubled and gave him a hard time? one time i had an anxiety attack so bad that i scratched the shit out of my face/forehead bc i felt so trapped, so misunderstood, doing push-ups for probably the 6th time that day for something so frivolous. he laughed in my face that day. 
making a random nurse check to make sure i was really on my period bc he couldn’t believe i ever started bc i was too scared to tell anyone.
he’d tell his friends, in front of me, how ungrateful i am, constantly airing whatever i’ve done to everyone and anyone. like he needed to hear their validations towards how he was treating us bc of our “misbehaving”. and they always gave it to him. always. 

hey! but at least i’m independent and have plenty motivation to cut a bitch if needed.

"hey guys. so, for background my mother is a 56 year old fully functioning drug addict with unmedicated bipolar disorder. she's on antidepressants but that's about it as far as treatment goes. her behavior has increased in abusiveness, and she talks and acts like a teenager almost constantly. i am a 20y/o female with my own past substance issues, and have experienced physical & verbal abuse from her, my father, and 2 past relationships. my most recent one ended a few weeks ago and was very violent to the point where i thought id die if i didn't get out. she is aware of the severity of abuse that occurred in both of these. 

so, after leaving my most recent relationship, quite literally the day that it ended i sped home in a full panic attack to ask her to come with me to get my phone and other belongings as my ex had taken them and threatened destruction. her exact response to seeing me, with strangulation marks, in a panic attack, was ""Are you sure that even happened?...ugh well i need a cig and a shower before i deal with this."" and she did just that. after detailing the abuse that i had been silently dealing with, she showed a good amount of empathy for me but was condescending about how i was just gonna go back and how she doesn't understand how someone could be weak like me bla bla bla. 

but the real issue is, she has now started using the abusive behaviors that i told her my ex used on me. she will come at me violently like she's going to hit me or say/do things that i told her he'd do to me. prior to this, she hadn't tried physical violence with me since i was 15. i just don't understand what is making her be like this. it's heartbreaking. 

she's always made me be her therapist and best friend as i'm the only girl, but now when i give her actual advice that is healthy and not unhinged, she flies into a rage and it spirals into a massive argument where she essentially morphs into my ex boyfriends; she will quote the exact words i've told her, she will take and break my belongings like i told her, she will record me after i've become hysterical, and she will attempt physical violence on me which she hadn't done in almost 6 years. i am fully capable of overpowering her if it came to it, and she knows this. she always backs down once i make it known that i will defend myself, but unfortunately i do always flinch first as it's involuntary and ptsd related. 

i just wanna know what could be causing this so i could maybe put a stop to it? she keeps pushing my limits and getting more violent. i'm not sure why she wants to put hands on me so bad, but i really do not want to hit my mother. "
"   I'm asking for insight because I'm unsure if I'm being abused or not. I don't want to tell anyone I know, because I fear they'll say that I am from a lack of understanding. I am just wondering if what's happening to me is normal and if I'm just spinning things out of proportion out of selfishness or ungratefulness. Sorry if this is a lot. 

   I'm 17 years old and living with my mother. My mother is a kind and hardworking woman who hasnt stopped working since she immigrated to the US. Since I was a kid we’ve had a lot of conflict between us. I don't really remember my early childhood but I became suicidal at 9 because I felt like everyone hated me, and that I was a burden to my family mostly because I did things my mother didn’t like (I can’t remember what I did at that time, but it was related to online activity.) 

One event that did stick with me (9Yrs old) was when she smashed my phone against the wall because I was watching an animation meme video on it that she thought was stupid. What caused her to break my phone was my step-father engaging in an argument with her, that I had provoked by complaining to him. After that she drove me and my brother to stay the night at a motel. From then on I began contemplating running away from home.

   I grew quieter and more reserved which upset her, understandably. She wanted to speak with me but I had nothing to say to her. Whenever I cried she always had to know the reason why, regardless if I wanted to keep the reason to myself. I remember once I took a shower at 1AM when I was 11(I was binge watching a TV show and lost track of the time) and she “beat” me for showering late (it wasn’t severe.) But that did hurt me emotionally. 

  I feel like my mother is very controlling over me, always judging my friends and my appearance and what I spend my time doing. If I speak with a tone or pitch she doesn't like then I have an attitude. When I don’t smile she tells me to smile, and when I do smile inauthentically, she gets mad that I'm faking my smile and starts lecturing me. This especially bothers me because when my face is relaxed she imitates my expression by pouting horrifically. 

   Recently I've been trying to explore my tastes and express myself through my appearance. I like alternative clothing and I’ve been trying to build a more masculine build due to gender dysphoria by working out (I’m nonbinary, I can't tell her this.) So I went shopping for the first time at the mall (alone, with girls from church) this year and bought huge baggy shirts from the male section. I come home and she discovers they’re for men ,because of the tags, and yells at me panickily that these are men’s clothing. She holds up a flannel I got and exclaims it's a men's shirt. I couldn't defend myself because I froze up, but thankfully my brother did and told her that it's modern female fashion. She then dismisses me to go shower and gets upset about how long I was out at the mall. (5 hours.) 

She’s also allowing me to lift weights but tells me I shouldn’t lift so much or else I’ll look like a man. I also can't cut my hair short the way I want to and she hasn’t told me why.

   I’ve stopped arguing with her and become more obedient, doing whatever she asks or wants of me. I barely ask her for anything now in fear that she’ll use whatever I want against me. But I've developed repressed anger towards her which I feel bad about. She also doesn’t share my happiness. This summer I’ve spent more time gaming because I finally made friends (before I had no friends) , but instead of being happy for me she’d get mad and say that I’m wasting my summer. She would kiss me goodnight and slam my door angrily. When I excitedly told her my friend was coming to our church for the first time, she scolded me and warned that my friend shouldn’t be a distraction. 

   I could keep writing but then this post would be the length of a novel. In short, I just feel like I have no control over my life. I grew up sheltered and I’m still being sheltered today. I feel like I’m not allowed to make mistakes and grow on my own. In order to live the least problematic and stressful life I have to bottle up all my emotions and do whatever she says. I’ve lost friends because of this, and I fear that I’ll lose my current friends. I just want to leave as soon as possible, learn how to drive and get a job to save up for an apartment so I can finally have some autonomy. Today she picked me up from school and began berating and yelling at me for getting “defensive” and that I shouldn’t get defensive with her because she’s my mother. I always upset her somehow, everyday, and it's so tiring. I just wish I didn’t have the ability to think for myself so I could just let her mold me into whatever she wants me to be, her ideal “daughter"". 

   So please, I’d like to hear your thoughts. Is this abuse? I'm dying to know. I just want to know if my anger and sadness is justified. It’s killing me. Thank you.

"F15. id told my friend about my mothers abuse and showed him my post (on this account) about her basically explaining what she did.

his mother works at our school for lunch duty? i dont think shes a teacher. but she seems really kind and he agrees. i asked him what if he told her mom and he said she wouldn’t be able to just keep it a secret and most likely tell someone and get me help. (most likely cps) which is fine.  but ive heard horror stories about cps making it worse and not listening to the victim so they just leave which I really dont want to happen. nor do i want me or my two year old sister to be sent to our fathers, which i suspect may happen to her which I absolutely do not want to happen 

her father is a weird creep. he had 9 year old me in a bathing suit at the beach (literally just me. it wasnt a family picture) as a screen saver for a very long time before my mom told him to change it. almost wanna say a year? but i cant remember. ik it was atleast a few months

in a physical fight he bruised my mom (and possibly injured her cause she had back problems after that) and called the police on HER like he isnt the one that bruised her?

also scolded my mom saying she should hit me more (mind you he was my stepdad for a long time. if hes willing to say this to my mom because im not his kid imagine what he’ll do to her) said if he had a dog he would shove its nose in its shit while beating it to treat it a lesson

sent me RED FLOWERS on valentines day… my mom had broken up with him a long time before that and he lived in a apartment separate from our house

and raped?? my mom multiple times. when they were sharing a bed he would literally just pull down her undergarments without her consent and fuck her while she was silent and just laying there 

pulled a gun on my mother and aunt while they were literally just having a sibling argument while little me was in the room

i also suspect that he MIGHT have raped me when i was young (before first grade). story is my mom left me in the tub to go get my clothes out of the dryer but she fell asleep on the couch while waiting. next thing i remember is waking up naked in my bed but the weird thing was that i was absolutely terrified, so much so that i frantically ran to find my mother. while helping me she went to go ask him about it and she said he was acting really weird and nervous like she could tell his heart was racing. weird thing was i dont remember feeling any pain, although i could be making up memories? (imagery wise, i know what happened story wise but i mean visuals) for example the whole story i imagined it was in my current house i grew up in until my mom told me it happened in our old house in baltimore which so i dont know. But another weird thing is that i wet the bed until i was 11. so ??

on that note i also remember that (also maybe before first grade?) when i was little my mom set up a camera in my room while she went to go take a shower because she didnt trust my stepdad around me cause i was so little. (i dont know the logic around that either. but okay) and he saw her creep around the corner into my bedroom. she jumped out the shower and he scurried into the other room. which is weird if he wanted to say good night… right? i also swear ive seen him stare at my ass going up the stairs (as a teenager) atleast once. 

the whole reason my baby sis has visitation is literally for control (he’s manipulative and gaslighty in general.) he most likely got my mother pregnant on purpose (they were together for 10 years and a YEAR after they broke up he got her pregnant even after she told him she wasnt on the pill… theyve never had a pregnancy scare, mainly because it was a loveless relationship.) theyd argue after she was born and one day he was like “ill see you in court.” she asked for space after that cause she was tired of seeing him every fucking week but he threw a tantrum after a few months and indeed took her to court. he probably doesnt even gaf ab her THAT much cause when my mom was struggling with money she asked him ONCE for diapers and he acted weird about it so she had to scrape the last of whatever she had to get enough money. he makes almost 100k a year.

sorry we got a bit off topic there but as you can see why i do not want him or his family (dont know them that well but theyre probably weird asf too) to take my sister either. ill put up with the abuse if i have to to prevent this or going to anyone else in mine because honestly my other family members arent stable either. :/

but i dont know if i have a choice ): i dont know what to do, because who else would i go to? and forget me, what about my sister? i dont want anything to happen to her. should i tell? or just.. wait it out? its already starting with my sister. even though she is a bit rowdy and can be really annoying most of the time shes just a baby and when my mom gets irritated she shoves her off of her if shes climbing on her (not too hard but enough to make me uncomfortable) or snaps/yells at her. we even argued a bit last week because she said something like my sister is gonna start needing whoopings soon because she acts like a brat and i tried to tell her there are other ways but she just started saying “you guys dont listen until i get aggressive” (im pretty sure im overall a good kid and i dont usually ignore her on purpose. i just have adhd (forgetful) or depression (clinical. and really bad) but this is unacceptable in her eyes and not an “excuse”) like wtf. i feel like i could honestly finally heal if i got from this suffocating ass household. it could be the source of my depression for all i know other than adhd. and honestly i can feel the thoughts of suicide coming back. i feel so lost 

i also dont have any evidence ): "
"hello, i've come here to ask for some advice regarding what to do in my situation, i have a very strong moral compass but i'm unsure if doing things the way i want to will bring upon a good result.

one of my legal guardians is abusive, and she physically beats my dog when she is angry at him ( i have audio evidence of this on my phone.) i love my dog so much, and i know its wrong but i can take the abuse from her but not to our small dog. i want to report her to the police , how do i do that in a way it can't lead back to me reporting it?

im scared that if she finds out it was me and she somehow is not convicted that once she's set free she may hurt me. i'm only 17, and i don't know what i'd do without my dog, and being down one legal guardian would be detrimental. but i need to do this, i don't want my dog to have to suffer anymore."
"I 22 f, have been living with my extremely toxic family my whole life. Various types of abuse throughout my life.

(You don't need to read the whole post)
My questions: 
1. Can I call the DV hotline when I'm not in active physical danger or when I'm just being verbally and mentally abused with some physical abuse sprinkled in? Ie not an emergency?
2. Will the police get involved??
3. Are there services where I can get a temporary home until I'm on my feet? Like for peoppe who aren't in an abusive intimate relationship, but with family?
4. Is abuse from adults to adults in your family still dv? 
5. Do I have to be physically abused to use resources like temp dv housing? Or financial assistance??

I just want to be safe and im having a VEEY hard time. I'm losing it guys, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on.


People in the house hold: uncle boomhaur (he talks like boom from king of the hill), uncle fasting (oldest uncle), grandma, random chick's (women my uncle fasting brings over to the house all the time)

Base context: my uncle fasting lives in the basement with me. The basement has some bedroom, which he has, I'm in the laundry room. The basement has a sliding door that I'm not allowed to lock. I have a cat that he threatens to take from me everyday. He brings over women a lot, and let's them stay here by themselves unsupervised

More context: i look just like my whole of a mother, which everyone here hates, even me. I get treated like absolute garbage for it. My father was killed when I was a teen and my uncle boomhaur blames me for not stopping it, my grandma resents me and has treated me like trash since it happened

My family is a very much ""call the police and you'll pay"" mind of family.

I need help. I have only given a tid bit of context, but it's he'll. I get called useless, worthless, a pig, a fatass, retard, dumb bitch, whale, trash, ugly, evil, manipulative, a liar, an abuser etc. I get told to kms on the daily. I can't eat without being punished, even if someone tells me I'm allowed to. I don't have a license or a vehicle so I rely on my grandmother and uncle fasting for rides, but I'm terrified of my grandma and my uncle fasting is always busy with someone else. I van only go to the store once a month, and even then I'm expected to buy the whole house with my food stamps (illegal BTW, I can get arrested for state assistance fraud) and even then, I get in trouble for eating it. I have to make stashes in my room and eat microwaved food or fast food to eat. I am shamed for any food I eat ANY. I eat once a day, and sometimes not at all because I can't take it. Every day I think of sewerslide, I'm losing my mind.

My uncles will come down and berate me until I cry and basically spit on me. My uncle boomhaur is a very violent man, putting me in a choke hold, threatening to kill me, assaulting me, threatening to burn our house down or chop me.up into pieces, he has also doen... very inappropriate things to me, that no one believes me about.

They all spread lies about me and make me look REALLY bad to other people.

I was late by 5 minutes at the end of my shift because we were busy and I needed my shift meal cause that's all I was gonna be able to eat that day, and my grandma threatened me with homelessness because she SHE was exhausted. (She's 68) her work: she works as a companion, she sits in a chair all day playing dice games with a man who has Parkinsons(very nice man, and she's great with him), I work in a restaurant. Spot the difference."
"Hi I need some advice so if you could take a moment to comment I would be very grateful. My (17f) dad, has a very authoritarian parenting style. Beatings, yelling, and name calling is all very normal in my household. Today, I had plans to go out with my boyfriend to our highschool football game. My dad doesn’t know I have a boyfriend and I don’t intend to tell him any time soon. Usually my dad lets me go to these school events without bothering me, but today he said he was going to tag along and bring my brother. I started freaking out and broke down crying. Now you may be thinking I’m freaking out because I’m hiding my boyfriend from him and I don’t want to get caught. Yes and no. As much as I don’t want to get caught I honestly just hate being around my dad in general. When I hear him talk it feels like an annoying piercing sound abusing my ears. I don’t know if that makes sense. But I just hate him. I hate looking at him, talking to him, I try to force myself to like him and tolerate being around him but I harbor so much hate for him. I feel terrible atp because he’s not the best dad but I know in his own twisted way he cares for me. He pays for me to participate in extracirrculars. I’m an awful daughter. But some part of me can’t help but hate him. For everything he’s done. How do I repress these emotions. I want to hurt him, hurt myself. I feel like I'm going crazy. I literally I just can't "
these people will be insulting you for an hour pkus like what hahah
After a fight (previous posts) she has been ignoring me for 2 days. I left the house without saying goodbye and it feels so wrong and sad.
"I am 27 years old. 28 in March of next year.   

Yesterday I told my parents I am moving away. I share a bedroom at home with my younger sister, and my dad tries to control every aspect of my life. What I eat (always comments how I look and how much I weight), what I do during the day and even wants to control my money. 
For the past 12 years or so he hasnt worked. Not because he cant or doesnt get a job, he actually got at least 5 job offers in the last two or three years, but he doesnt want to work. He thinks and proudly shoves it in our faces that he went to the store and cooked lunch. He also pays the bills - just never on time. 
Yesterday I told them “I decided Im moving”. He continues to (try) to manipulate and emotionally extort me for more than an hour - I dont respect and love them, my approach should have been “what do you think of me slowly moving away”, he told me he is disappointed in me and that this is not how he raised me. Also told me if I move away, Ill pay for everything on my own (which is no problem, I will). 
He also is constantly mean towards my mom, even tho she brings in all the money, my dad has the credit card and controls what my mum buys and she has to ask everytime she wants to buy something to get it. My mum used to be a happy bubbly person, she is terribly depressed now. 
There is no question I want to ask, I just wanted to write this down. Because everytime I feel sad and bad about how my dad acts I think Im egoistic and spoilt and I should be grateful. "
"today at home I had set my phone on the dining room table as I was working in the kitchen. my mom comes in and tries to touch my phone, I grab it and move it away from her saying ""that's my phone."" so she knows 1. it's not her phone 2. she doesn't need to touch my phone 3. it was on a clear space on the table, she didn't need to use the table, nor was my phone in the way of anything. 

she goes ""don't snatch things out of my hand""

my response was ""it's not yours""

because well, it's not. she doesn't pay my phone bill she didn't pay for my phone, there's nothing on there she needs to look at and she didn't need to touch or move it for any reason  

so what does my mom say to me?

""talk nicer to me or I'll slap the fuck out of you.""

she said that with a straight face looking me right in the eye.

few minutes after that she's being very motherly and sweet to my little brother asking if he's eaten dinner.

yes I am the eldest and the only daughter."
"last year on Father’s Day my stepdad got really drunk and started yelling really violently and they were having a argument (I forgot what it was about) and I must of said something because he walked up to me while I was sitting on the couch and grabbed me by my shirt and said dont every say that shit again or I’ll fucking hurt you and so me, my mom and my grandma all went in my room to hide. But then he barges in and my mom tries to block him but he pushes her out of the way and says I will get a divorce by tomorrow bitch and then he goes over to me and grabs by my shirt again and just holds me eventually me and my mom had enough and we went to my grandmas house to stay but when we got back the next day I went to friends house while my mom talked it out with him the moment she called my phone and told me I could come back I got so nervous but when I got back she had made lunch and it was like nothing happened and I never got my apology and he still screams violently at me for the littlest of things and ruins my mental health and he’s even called me names in the past for example he’s called my really annoying because I was being bullied because kids were calling me that on the bus and then he said the truth is you are he’s called me stupid even though I think I’m only 1 away from his IQ he’s called me a moron he’s called me unathletic  even though he’s gotten injury’s when he played sports but I haven’t."
"My mum used to be physically and emotionally abusive (as well as very neglectful) and is now “just” neglectful (and maybe still slightly emotionally abusive but nowhere near as bad as before) but now I’m more scared of her?

I’m not sure if it’s because I know it’s fake (if/when I move out she’s screwed, both financially because I pay a lot of the bills and my mum sees me as a bit of a financial safety net, and also because I’m pretty sure she knows once I’ve moved out I will be telling the rest of the family what she’s done to me-I don’t feel safe to rn because I don’t have family close by I could love in with) or because I spend so much time just anticipating her losing her cool. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells 24/7."
"Yes, I’m in therapy. My mother and I’d relationship has always been toxic. I’m seeing now how abusive and toxic she is and how I don’t want a relationship with her. 

Throughout my life, she and I have been very close (but like codependency and enmeshment) until a little over a year ago when I cut her off. I’m living with her because I’m unable to work due to trauma (not from my parents, from ABA). I avoid her as much as possible. I’m feeling like I don’t want a relationship with my mother and I don’t want relationships with any of my family. 

I’ve struggled with feeling like cutting my mother off/being estranged from her is unhealthy and wrong- when the opposite is true. This is a totally healthy response to being abused by someone. Her being my mother doesn’t mean I should look at this any differently. I’ve also struggled with not trusting myself, including when it comes to cutting my mother off. I’ve also struggled with feeling like I’m bad for cutting my mother off, which I know isn’t true. I’ve struggled with feeling guilty for deciding to cut my mother off emotional and my brain goes into a state where it’s in denial of her being abusive towards me. 

I will work when I am feeling well enough to do so, move out once I pay off some debt, and go back to school when the school year starts. 

My dad is also abusive- He doesn’t bond with me as much. I have thought about living with him as he said I could."
"okay i (20F) didn’t rly think my home life was abusive most of my life, mostly due to the fact many of the things happened weren’t stereotypical of “abuse”. i left about 3 months ago after a physical altercation between my grandpa and me as things have escalated the past couple years so i went to live with my bf and his family for the summer. i always remembered bad things about my childhood, i had core bad memories, such as praying for god to “make me an angel” at age 5 because i didn’t want to be alive anymore but was too young to understand. after leaving tho, i started remembering a lot of other things from childhood. just random moments of “wtf how could someone actually do that to a kid or say that” for example. i randomly remembered my family had taught me by age 8 how to like go to a kill in defense ig? but definitely knew a handful of ways to just off someone with my hands or immediate objects (if need be, they always said). or i’ll remember a random punishment my papa did. i started having a re-occurring nightmare most nights. the setting changes but it’s the same theme every time. i can never really remember faces or the end or specific details, i just wake up feeling really bad if i try to think about it, and i have it at least every other night. and the memories just keep coming out of nowhere. someone says one thing and i just remember and have to sit there for a second comprehending, even tho it’s not rly relevant. i looked into what ptsd flashbacks are actually like, and i hate using such a severe illness, but im starting to think it might have something to do with that. has anyone else experienced this after leaving the abusive situation???? i’ll just randomly remember things from when i was like 5-12 w out trying at all. and the core ones, about 2-5 memories that i remembered before, just keep popping up in my head constantly, even tho it’s been years. i remember these ones a lot better."
"Can I escape? Legally, I mean. I’m a 17 year old female who’s been living with my father since I was 5. He’s had sole custody of me pretty much my entire life, but recently things have taken a turn for the worst.                                                          My father was raised quite conservatively, and religiously. So he raised me the same way, but to him mental health is a thing. I have manic bpd and I get into depressive episodes often. But my father’s solution was to always just get over it. And therefore I want to leave. I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half and we’ve made plans for me to move out with him into his parent’s house. They are willing to take me in and love me wholeheartedly. I honestly can’t wait, they have always been extremely supportive and mindful when it comes to my situation and mental health. All they’ve wanted was for me to get out and be happy and join their family, and honestly I want to.                                               I’ve been planning my move to join their family but there’s two issues that my father has. #1 They live practically across the country so he’s scared, and #2 His family don’t expect much from me. My father has always had high expectations for me because he knows I can do it. But he also see’s me as lazy and if I move in I’m a leech. Which is quite the opposite, my boyfriend’s parents haven’t said or mentioned anything about rent but I’ve offered anyways. I even plan on doing online college out there and paying for it myself. I have no intention of leeching of them and I’m far too stubborn to do so anyways. But due to this my father has become emotionally and mentally manipulative. From saying that I won’t make it out there, to outright saying I’ll probably die, he’ll go on and on. There’s been moments where he’ll be lecturing me and make me so uncomfortable I hyperventilate and want to vomit. He also likes to say I’m just like him while caressing my shoulders and neck in an almost inappropriate manner. I swear it’s disgusting, so much so that there’s been times where I’ve wanted to make him hate me, or disgusted by me. I’ve even thought about committing right in front of him to make him suffer, but I won’t. I have too much to live for and a happy life around the corner.                                  My only issue is, it’s getting worse. And I honestly don’t think I can stay much longer. I would leave if I were able to but my father recently divorced my mother. As part of the contract entails, I can’t leave my address within 100 miles or else my father will serve time in prison. But I honestly don’t think they’d arrest him or do anything to me. I’m almost 18, as a matter of fact, I turn 18 in less than 5 months. I’m wondering if I’ll just be able to leave since I’m so close to being the legal age and the amount of money and time it would take to file the paperwork anyways. I’d already be gone, what do you think?? "
"Sigh so I’ve decided I’m gonna use Reddit and specifically this place at a way to journal/ document whats going on with my dad so I can remember. this weekend my dad tried to accuse me of attacking him.. yea. How it whent down was I was cutting open a container of potato soup,(the kind from Safeway yk, the lip of the seal for it just breaks right off so you have to meticulously cut it with sissors do you can get all of the contents out properly.) minding my own business just tired from having started college the week prior. And he had the audacity to walk over and be like “your doing it wrong, don’t use those sissors” keep in mind it’s the only sissors we have in the kitchen and they are old and dull so I make due. And the rips them from my grip and starts cutting for me and I ask him to stop and hand me back the sissors and that I’m an adult and can handle cutting open my own food. He continues anyway proceding to cut the plastic film in a way that will make it harder to get the max amount of my moneys worth from the container and I panic so I stupidly grab the sissors from his hand and try to safely pull them from his grip in a way where neither of us would be in danger but it doesn’t work because he’s a strong man and I’m not. He the. Gasps and an inch from my face out of nowhere yells on the top of his lungs “Your attacking me” and I let go ack back off not before he grips my shoulder really tight and leaves a red mark that faded after a few hours. I immediately shut down and try to stop myself from reacting and crying to no eval because ik giving him a reaction only makes it worse. He started antagonizing me saying I’m dramatic for crying and when i started crying to myself asking what did I even do in a high pitched voice he mocks me calling me micky mouse. He kept repeating to me that I need to stop acting like the victim when all I was doing was reacting to how he was acting. I’m lucky I was able to spend the night at my partners house that night because I don’t wanna think how exhausting it might have been to stay in that house with him any longer in that moment. After staying at my partner me house for a night or two my dad messaged me saying “are you doing better??” And I can’t quite tell if that genuine care or antagonistic but regardless it just feels to weird that before that he was acting as if I attacked him and is now asking me if I’m done? Done with what? I just don’t understand. Regardless he’s still thinks he’s in the right and it’s exhausting. I wish I had somewhere else to live but just don’t. And it’s just driving my already poor mental health into the ground. "
My dad has been in and out of my life for years.  He had alway chosen alchocel and women over me but when he does come back he tries to buy me stuff to make up for it.  He’s yelled at me and my mom in a drunken rage drove me while drunk and he got a DUI last year and is not trying to get a new license.  He had cheated on my mother several times and even after they broke up he stills blames it on her.  He has lost family heirlooms and never did and follow up to get them back.  He tried to screw my mom’s sister and brought his girlfriend to my mom’s and his apartment.  And years later he lied to me and her to get me and his girlfriend to go on vacation together.  His mother and him have both tried to gaslight me into liking her his mother also fueling rumors of my mother cheating to justify him doing it for years. He’s yelled at my mother for doing her job and refuses to help with bills or food he does even pay us own rent he lives off his mother.   When I was sa he ignored it he tried to act like everything was fine after. 
My parents are not only abusive but they're also extremely racist. They think all non-white people should be shipped off to another planet. They can't go one day without making a racist remark. I'm so tired of all this shit. I hate my parents more than anything else.
"As a kid (ages 4-10) my dad gave us spankings as a punishment, but a detail of it really makes me feel weird about the whole thing. I know spanking is relatively common, but I recently learned online it was usually just a smack or two over a clothed bottom or hand. 

My dad's spankings would start with taking off our pants, then bending over. Dad would then hit us between 5-20 times depending on the severity of the offense (sever being something like breaking something or hitting a sibling). We did it unclothed because ""it hurts more on bare skin"". 

I understand this is abusive, but what kind? It gives me a sick feeling to recall and the trauma has caused major blowup arguments between me and partners who are interested in spanking in the sexual sense. I go ballistic when it's brought up. Is this normal spanking? Please help."
So a lot has happened since my last post. I’ve told my father in a text that I know he cheated and abused my mom in every way. And I guess since he knows his covers been blown he’s been absolutely awful to me. I recently paid off my car and the bank sent the title to his address since I didn’t change my address on my bank profile and he won’t send it to me. And tried to convince me that I can’t sell the car because he co-signed on it. And recently my little brother got his first phone. I don’t get to talk to him much since I’m active duty military and he’s never had a phone before. My father took his phone and blocked me and scared my brother into not speaking to me. On top of all that he has the nerve to text me and demand an apology… Apology for what? Calling out your actions? If he can treat his wife and kids this way imagine how he treats random people… how does someone come to be this awful. What hurt the most is he doesn’t want me part of his family. This is the worst heartbreak I’ve honestly ever felt. Any advice would be much appreciated.
"I actually hate my mom so much, sometimes I love her, and sometimes I hate her, she was abusive towards me when I was younger and now that I grow up she stopped beating me up, but still, she's very problematic I don't know how to explain, like, she sometimes support 🍇. In fact, she has the same mentality as some men. She always yells at me for something I really didn't do, she force me to clean my brothers room while he is playing on his damn phone, and when I ask her to ask my brother to do it himself since it's his room she said ""but you're a girl and he's a man!"" I sometimes wish I was a boy, I remember it was one of my biggest dream to be born as a boy when I was younger, not in a trans way, but maybe if I was born as a boy my mom wouldn't treat me like that in the first place. She also used to wake me up by hitting me on the face. And the day I started cutting myself and she find out, the first idea coming from her mind wasn't to help me, but it was to take the knife from my hands and beat me up with it"
"Selective amnesia - when your mind temporarily forgets/invalidates abuse you’ve experienced to lower your stress levels/risk of trauma.

While this is a very useful thing my mind does for me (I can literally be happy 5 minutes after being yelled at for something that’s logically incoherent), I forget the seriousness of the situation after I’m in a better mood, almost invalidating or downplaying it. This makes it hard to actually find a solution to the problem.

For context, I’m in foster care and I’m thinking of asking my social workers to move me placement. My foster mum is very emotionally abusive. Some examples of this are treating a child above everyone when they’re the “good kid” in order to make the “bad kid(s)” feel isolated and worse. They encourage abusive behaviour from the “good kid” to their siblings as well, in order to further this dynamic.

Another thing she does is uses the completely wrong approach when you make a mistake. I’m talking if you leave one breadcrumb on the side because you didn’t notice it, she will berate you, saying things like, “When you’re in uni, no one will put up with this” “You’re incompetent without me” and other damaging fixed beliefs, instead of encouraging a child to improve in a way that isn’t degrading or damaging to their self worth.

She’s also very gaslighting I’ve noticed recently. I started recording her as I kept doubting myself mid convo and she will accuse you of one thing at the start of the argument and when you prove her wrong she will say she actually said something completely different by the end. For example (sorry if this is tmi) she said that I left blood in the toilet and put the cardboard toilet roll IN the toilet and called me disgusting for it. When i said i wasn’t on my period she changed it to a number 2. When i said i didn’t do that either she pulled out the toilet roll (from the bin 🤮) and it had a water droplet on it and she acted like that’s what she was saying the whole time and that it’s disgusting and unacceptable. Now im doubting what she’s accusing me of half the time and whether the way she’s made me feel incompetent may have been complete lies sometimes.

When I go to my social workers about this, I’m not triggered anymore and I don’t feel that there is a problem despite logically knowing there is. I try to tell them I need to get out but don’t feel confident enough to defend why as she gaslights and changes the story and i don’t have the social competence to counteract this, as well as the fear of getting in trouble if i offend her. I don’t know how to deal with this."
Both my mom and dad have been verbally and physically abusive towards me since my early childhood. Theyre so dumb that i have to help them with simple things almost every day.  But they say that i'm useless without their help.
"My lazy eye gave me life long medical ptsd 

When I was 2 I needed glasses for my vision, not a issue. When I was 6 I was told I had a lazy eye and needed to wear a patch. I didn’t like the patch but not traumatized from it but never wore it because of this they recommend eye drops. Both me and my parents did not understand how this treatment worked and because of this they gave me no option to go back to the patch. 
When it was time to put these drops in I ran away from a freak flight or fight reaction. Both my parents chased me around the house like crazy, and then when my dad grabbed me he started running so fast with me like he was trying to getting me out of. A burning building or it was life or death it was not. He slammed me so hard on the couch it hurt, put all his body weight on me to the point I could barley breathe. Despite kicking and trying to get away, I could not, I was crying and in a absolute panic attack with no help!! 
My mom put the drops in me and afterwards I was given crap for it and told that I probably cried them out anyways and that I was a dram queen/ faker and was told how I just wanted to make a scene and how I was being a baby. It was the most scary traumatizing thing ever and I still have flash backs/ night mares to this day despite being 25. "
"I have an opportunity to move out in a year and live with my grandparents, while im moving out I still wont be able to cut off contact with family fully, but I feel like I might have a lot more freedom and less abuse happen to me.

[TW SA?]

I [22F] have only told one other person about this and they said it sounded like SA. I guess part of me is still coming in acceptance of the possibility that my own mother might've SA'd me. 

This happened when I was around 13 years old when I first got my period. I wasn't very educated on women's menstrual cycles at the time so I didn't know how to use a tampon let alone where to stick it. It was summer time so i would go to day camp at a local park every day to swim. My mom said I won't be able to swim with a pad on while on my period and suggested I start using tampons instead. I asked my mom how to use one, my mom seemed surprised for some reason. I honestly thought she was gonna show me like a educational video on YouTube or something I didn't think she would suggested putting it in for me. I know this is probably just normal but it's still felt gross to me. She had me set butt naked in the living room on the couch while she tried to shove the tampon in me but it hurt and I started crying saying ""stop it hurts!"" But she just told me to shut up and to stop being a baby. Again I cried stop and then she stopped rolled her eyes told me I was crying for nothing and went downstairs. I felt so disgusted and embarrassed. I felt so embarrassed I didn't talk about it til just this past year. Thanks to this event I refuse to ever use tampons again."
"im done with this life. its currently 12:03 am while im writing this but \~20 mins ago i woke up to my dad taking my door and the first thing i thought was ""fuck this im revenge killing myself."" i know this may seem dramatic but so are my parents, so goodbye. i thought this life was shitty but my friends were the only good part of it"
"I was bullied in high school, maybe I overreacted by skipping classes a lot to avoid my bullies. They found out and just told me to read the bible and pray. When it still continues they said I’m distracting them from their work by my constant bad mood. They also said I’m a burden to the family (word for word). I swore to myself to never talk to them about my problems again, but sometimes I just can’t help it and talk to them anyway. The next responses are not as extreme as that one but saying the solution is to read bible and pray is a regular thing they love to say.

Recently I move to another country for internship, I already predicted that I will not be homesick and missing them at all because whether they are here or not does not change anything. Sure enough, two months in and I don’t miss them at all. But recently my male roommate (Im female) behaviour troubles me. His mood is very dependent on me, he will get upset if I dont talk to him. One day, I told him to not get too close physically and he got upset. Of course I got scared, so I cant help but tell my mom whats happening. She said “Maybe he likes you🤭🤭” (word for word).

I think I have learned to depend on myself in most things. But there just some moments where I cant handle it myself. I dont want to handle things alone but I dont want to burden my friends and I cant ask my family because they will just hurt my feelings even more"
"He has SA’d and physically abused me, mentally tortured me I want him out my life permanently how do I actually go about this? Also especially when everyone is against my decision and keeps trying to put me at risk bc of the sake of family image. I need help in establishing and actually keeping those boundaries. 

He also has a horrible affliction where he blames me for anything and everything. My toxic siblings are never the culprit. Even though one of them engaged in the most disgusting, abhorrent and criminal behaviour I am still blamed and it makes me suicidal. Even when it is point blank obvious it is not me and I am in fact the victim I am still blamed . My dad is a terrible man who constantly tries to make me walk on eggshells for basic rights in my life and without whom I would never have suffered. He bullied and abused me as a child, then a teenager and now continues to as an adult. His posse of sycophantic nutjobs are not going to pull me back. I refuse to forgive him. I refuse to give in. I refuse to accept his twisted, disgusting and perverted abuse and mistreatment of me, all because of his extreme sexism. He is abusive to me when other people call me pretty/gentle, are nice to me, when men show me attention, when others find me sexually attractive because he is so narcissistic that he believes he is innocent when he’s actually bullied my mum and a lot of other people too. She nearly divorced him but her trauma bond made her stay. A lot of people rightly hate him and he has always tried to gaslight me into thinking that he is the victim in a scenario where he is mistreating others. 

He encouraged one of my siblings to actually continue and worsen the abuse towards me, and egged them on during it. He also blamed me for when said sibling began smearing their own sh*t on the walls and ceiling of the bathroom because of their special needs. That one fucked me up the most. 

I haven’t left right now honestly due to fear of the consequences. I need to get away from him and stop entertaining the controlling manipulation. He gaslights me into thinking there’s a problem I have that only he can resolve and so I have to keep being nice to him and stay around him and that’s not true. It’s just fucked up lies and games like usual. 

He’s a fucking awful person and the worst part is he’s a very powerful man aka a fucking CONSULTANT SURGEON. Which means NO ONE WILL EVER TOUCH HIM BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF PRESTIGE HE HAS, and that’s the reason I haven’t been able to get away yet. 

People only see the shiny fake exterior he presents rather than the monster he is beneath.

Im 18f I haven’t lived at home since I was 11 I got taken away because of abuse yet my mum still blames me for everything she won’t recognise it was abuse and always says it was my fault I’m autistic and had meltdowns as a kid I counted control it but every time we fall out cause of what she says she wants me to apologise I’m sobbing writing this cause she’s texting me now I just don’t know what to do anymore 
"My parents have been forcing me and my brother to look after are younger siblings 6 and 4 ,we do everything for them cleaning ,feeding we also do all the chores in the house and when we ever say anything they call us selfish and we should appreciate all the things they do for us and we should be honoured to be looking after family , Am 14 and and my brother is 11."
"So, for background I left my moms house a month after I turned 16 after years of abuse and manipulation it’s been about 4 months since then and I now live with my aunt and uncle but, my mom won’t give me my documents so I can get my license and work. I do plan on getting emancipated but I need to build evidence for that which is hard since I left abruptly in the middle of the night and every-time my mom contacts me it’s over the phone so it’s not like I can screenshot texts. Is there any legal action I can take as of right now?"

I am stuck all I want is my mom to be happy. This Reddit post is my last resort please I need help.
"So basically, I texted 988 and I was talking about my step and stuff dad blah blah blah. Im probably just overthinking it but apparently they said that they were going to report about the abuse and now im worried if anything bad is going to happen?  
Idk just curious."
"my mother had been getting into my space to much and it makes me sick so basically she’s been touching me and getting close to my bed (even though i tell her to not) 
And when i was little my mother would shame me and humiliate me and she always try’s to embarras me
And she always try’s to gain control over ne and i know she’s the parent she gets in charge bla bla  bla  but really it sucks.
She always talk about me and never her self (which is a sigh of narcissism).
And she would whoop me and say “why are you crying?” Aren’t i suppose to be the one crying?.” And she says shit like “i care for u” “i love u”  but deep inside i know she doesn’t. She can know stop acting and just tell the truth she thinks im a demon and a bad kid she’s also really judgmental towards me she always invades my privacy and she wants to know my phones password for some werid fucking reason but I’m not telling her cuz that’s pretty werid she never realizes what’s she’s doing also (This is only some of the stuff she’s done in my life there’s way more) but i want say it here anyways anything will help :)"
"I'm... a very silent person. I don't like conflict, I prefer not to engaged in arguments. I don't talk back if I can. That's my strategy after years of abuse and neglect.


I just don't give a fuck about others. I live my life, I work, paid my bills, buy my own stuff. I live my life quietly but it's always never enough to her. She's always complained about me, why am I alone? Why don't I date? Why don't I try other jobs? Why don't I find a man?

She's always picking fight about it, I'm tired. I tried to just brush it off as nagging but it fucking hurt. She screams and insults me but the next day asking help for this n that. Like, you can't do it like that.

A week ago, we had another fight, she just screamed at me because I didn't want to go on marathon. Literally it's just a small marathon in our city, I'm anemic, I can't go on things like that. So, I refused and she just kept going on n on while I stayed silent. And now I'm not speaking to her, not meeting her and just straight up avoiding her everywhere.

I'll probably move out soon and never want to step back in this house. It's a bit hard to find another place but I'll try to find one"
My best friend’s family wants me to move in with them and I gladly took them up on their generous offer. I’m getting everything sorted out but the biggest thing I need help with is telling my parents that I’m leaving as well as getting my things out of the house. My parents aren’t physically abusive so I’m not worried about that. Do I tell my parents a couple days before? The day of? I feel like they will try to convince me not to go and guilt trip me and make things as miserable as possible. I’m thinking of getting my best friend to help me move everything (not much) when my dad is at work so I will only have to deal with one parent. I’m thinking of slowly packing everything and giving things to be best friend secretly? Maybe that’s a stupid idea. Maybe I’m just overthinking it because of how nervous I am. Please give me some advice. How do I tell my parents that I’m moving in with people they almost hate and when do I tell them? When do I start moving my things? 
"i dont even feel like explaining my situation. im 16 recently realized i dont want to kill myself i just want to escape this place. live alone with my alcoholic mom who has some severe issues, in denial, so she takes it all out on her only child. my father is an absent superficial prick who pretends to care but really doesnt. sometimes i feel like what im going through isnt bad because its not like im being hit or anything maybe im just too sensitive. those are my parents, i dont have any other family, i only get two of them in this lifetime, i want to say i love them. they provide for me yes. yet is it normal to feel this unsafe and scared in your own home? i love them though. i miss how my mom was when i was younger. she never smiles now, i feel like a bad child for making her so tired. i have a lot of serious health problems shes in denial about, she has to take care of me all alone, id be suicidal if i was her. maybe she is. not like shed ever admit anything.wonder if she really does have issues though? how can you be so inhumane to the mentally weak. shes confusing. i wish i could hug her sincerely one day once we both work on our issues. i miss her. this mom feels like a complete stranger. i saw my doctor today, he validated my feelings. this suffering isnt normal in fact. made me feel better. im on new anti depressants now! i hope they work. he told me i could file a complaint against my mom if i wanted to. i wish, but im scared. i want to see her suffer the consequences, but shes also just human.. i want to help her so desperately, thinking about her makes me cry. she doesnt want that help though so its out of my control. i have made great progress with my mental health issues including separating myself from my family to help myself. but its been so difficult lately. i hope ill feel better soon"
"Hey I'm 17 and my mom is physically and mentally bringing me sickness I don't have a room bc our father kicked us out some years ago and now I'm forced to live with her ay the same room and sleep on a couch she's super abusive and want to control me not bc she care but bc I'm sure that brings her happiness. I was at my grandma's for a month today she got here the days before I felt so sick,she came today and now I'm sick out of nowhere and my depressive episode came again I'm so lost idk what to do. My mental health got sm better when I was away from her :/"
"For as long as I could remember my mother had an ugly temper. My mother mostly reacted with anger and suspicion or accusation to things. Like for example, if one of us came forward with bullying it was always “well what did YOU do” or “you SHOULD’VE done xyz”. Or if we voice how we don’t like the way she treats us it’s always anger and “you’re in MY house” “I CAN treat you how I WANT to” Much name calling, insulting and saying things she knows we’re insecure about. Low blows. Never can apologize verbatim “I’m sorry for what I did” can never just fucking own up to her hurtful actions. Whenever one of us, or even my dad, gets excited she’ll get annoyed and tell us to calm down  with an ugly look on her face. The worst thing she’s ever done is call me a f*ggot and c*ck sucker during an argument… (I am gay) 
I’ve just began to scratch the surface. Please ask questions to gauge. 

What is this? Is it narcissism? "
"I have grown up being Physically, Verbally, Emotionally and Psychologically abused by my mother ever since I can remember . She say's that it's my fault for being traumatized, and that it is my fault for not forgiving her for the years of pain and suffering that I endured under her. She also has the tendency to keep on repeating to me that I do not love myself because I won't forgive her. That the only way to love myself is if I forgive her. 

Does this count has Gaslighting?"

"Hello everyone, it's my first time posting on here and I just need a little guidance.  I have been bounding between my parent's houses since last September when my mom moved out after their divorce was finalized. Since then my dad (previous alcoholic with relapses about once every 1 or 2 months) has been treating me far better on a regular basis than he has been. This is great for me as it's allowed us to bond, however when we disagree or argue about anything he jumps straight to the end of the scale (screaming, name calling, berating, threatening violence, on some occasions he gets minorly physical) and it's mostly over nothing that concerns him, for example. Tonight I said I was expecting a phone call, and he asked from who and I said my boss. He then proceeded to fly off the handle about how it wasn't my place to make my concerns known in the workplace because I'm ""just an employee"". We then argued for about 2 or 2.5 hours on varying subjects of my worth and how I would never amount to anything even close to him. This is different to how my mom acts. Whenever I'm around her it's always some kind of argument. Usually it's over quick and without much to complain about, however she tries to pitch a sob story to guilt trip me into her views. This is a repeating cycle for me since whenever I argue with one parent the other becomes my friend hoping I'll spend more time at their house that week. It's gotten to the point that I look for excuses to leave the house or go on a drive whether it be to run an errand or two or just to visit my grandparents. I don't want to continue to walk on eggshells all the time with my mom or be forced to toe the line and take so much from my dad. Any advice is appreciated thank you all for your time 🙏"
"I’m currently shitting my pants. I’m taking this step because me and my therapist agreed it was time I get my power back. I had tried to talk to my step mom and father about SA they left me in when I was a child. Conversation is the images. My therapist told me I needed to finally confront my parents about denying me my social, birth certificate and medical records they won’t give back. I decided to do it Sunday I reached out they blocked my numbers my two younger siblings told me she was gonna be home Sunday and to show up at 9a.m to catch her before she runs errands. I am so afraid because Everytime I’ve tried to confront her in person she becomes very unpredictable. Laughing in peoples faces, spitting on people, trying to make them afraid with lawsuits. I followed what my therapist said and lawyer to make sure I don’t fall into her trap but I’m so afraid she’ll gaslight me in front of an officer or try to paint me as crazy. My bio father is in New Mexico and will not answer my calls and I’ve tried to reach out 4 different ways and I’m still being ignored. I know I need to do this so I can fully walk away from this relationship but I’m so afraid it’ll go south fast when I just want my legal documents."
"So six months ago, my ex cut me off after a two year long relationship. During that time, we argued and fought constantly, it was awful. We both constantly tried expressing our communication needs to each other but never understood. It's important to note that both of us had emotionally abusive parents (this is also a major factor in my depression and suicidal thoughts). My father has made good progress on improving himself since my childhood. He's definitely not perfect, but the difference in the way he talks to me in the past few years is vast. 



My mom on the other hand... Lately, I've been getting into the same huge arguments with her. I've been doing my absolute best to remain level-headed during these arguments, and by doing this I've managed to notice something extremely important. The way she argues with me is extremely manipulative. She gaslights, moves goalposts, and gets really nasty. And it all felt so familiar. Not just because it's the way she's always argued with me, but also because it's the way I argued with my ex. It's the way I've always argued with everyone. It's why I've lost all of my prior friendships and ended up completely alone. I realized that I picked up all of her toxic traits and used them to abuse people important to me in the same way. I've never felt so awful. But it's also given me motivation to improve myself and change my ways. I want to make efforts to manage my emotions better, become a better listener, be more constructive rather than destructive, and see my loved ones as people I disagree with rather than as my enemies. I'm also planning on further distancing myself from my mother. I think this will help with my mental state and personal growth, and hopefully it gets my mom to think more before she speaks, and maybe I could actually have a relationship with her in the future like I do now with my dad.



I'll never be able to heal the pain I caused my ex and other people I was close to in the past, but I can make damn sure it doesn't happen again. I will break the cycle of abuse, and I won't be defined by my parents' mistakes anymore. I will rise above."
"My dad is very controlling of food. I can’t get any food while he’s around the house, so I usually wait until he’s in the shower or left somewhere. I’ve tried even setting alarms for early in the morning to just eat but my house is old and the floorboards make enough noise to wake him up. He buys cookies and ice cream, but calls us fat and unhealthy if we eat them, so why even buy them?! I try to hide food around my room but I have no self control around food. At dinner (when he does decide to make me dinner) he usually makes huge portions of foods I’ve said I don’t like (I’m autistic so texture and smell is a big thing) I’ve stopped eating the lunches he packs me for school (not allowed to pack my own lunch) because I know I’ll not be hungry enough at dinner to finish all the food. On top of all of this he also controls the bathroom and has a strict 5 minute bathroom policy, which people who menstruate would know that’s not enough time. And only two sheets of toilet paper per bathroom visit. Anyways yeah I would kill for some pizza or anything with cheese right about now."
"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting on Reddit, and I discovered this forum because I want to find a healthy way to ask for help without trauma dumping people in and being judged for it.

For some context, my narc mom was always physically abusive up until about my senior year of high school because she attacked me so severely that my school got suspicious as to why I came to school late and in tears. She did this. I wanted to stay home from school for the first time in my academic career because I was so burnt out from my AP courses and preparing for SATs and college apps. Aside from this, my sibling recently passed this year, which has taken a toll on my family.

I now go to college in a city about an hour from my hometown and spend this summer taking summer courses, internships, working, and volunteering. Because of this, I've had to stay on campus all summer. Last week, my mother wanted me to visit the family home in time to see some family members. I initially agreed, but I had a friend who was leaving the country, and some of my friends wanted to throw a going away party for him. Due to scheduling issues, we had to have the going away party the day my mom wanted me home early. I called her to let her know I would be home late but still in time to see my cousins. She began saying, ""You think you're an adult"" (which I am; I'm 20) and other nagging words, but she never explicitly said no. After she hung up the phone, I thought nothing of it and moved on. She called me 20 minutes later, calling me a whore, and she explicitly said, ""You've been on campus for two months. I'm sure guys are rotating through your room, and you're giving yourself to guys."" I was utterly shocked when she said this because I've never had a boyfriend, let alone my first kiss, and the only time I've spoken to her about guys in my life was to express my disinterest in getting married. I kept asking her why she said what she said until she had no choice but to hang up on me. I then called her over 20 times because I wanted an explanation for this and have frankly grown tired of her insulting and degrading me and getting away with it. I called my father and asked him to pass the phone to her, but he refused and told me to calm down. I told him what she said to me, and he brought up the classic Muslim line, ""Your mother is your mother; you shouldn't even say oof to her."" which he often does whenever she wrongs me, to make me accept the treatment and write it off as the situation not being 'that bad.' but this time I couldn't do it.

I came home that night to confront her but fell asleep after a long workday. The next day, I waited till both my parents arrived from work and went to their room to confront them. I calmly said hello and asked her directly why she said what she said to me over the phone. My father told me to leave her alone because she was sick (which wasn't true). Instead of taking accountability for her actions or simply apologizing, she starts talking about a paragraph I sent her months before my sibling passed -this was a period when I refused to come home during the semester because she called me a b\*tch for accepting a position as vice president of an on-campus club dedicated to cancer research, she was upset because I didn't ask her- I will attach the paragraph to this post. She began yelling, calling me disrespectful, then lying and saying she never said that. My father, of course, confirmed, saying that he didn't hear her say that. I stood my ground and said that I wasn't being disrespectful in the paragraph I sent, and I wanted to know why she said what she said to me. She realized I would not let her get away with this and began screaming for me to go upstairs. I refused and she got in my face and slapped me and told me to ""get the f\*\*k out of her house"".

After this I lost it, I began yelling at her ""haven't you lost enough"" and went went upstairs to pack my things. My father followed me and blamed the entire situation on me, saying that I should've let it go and that because she is my mother, I should accept whatever treatment she dishes out to me. Luckily, I had a friend who knew about the situation and got me an Uber to her place. My father wouldn't let me leave, so I had to wait until my parents slept to go (around 1-2 am). From there, I didn't hear from them for five days, after which my mother called my job and lied, saying that my father was sick and that I did all this. I wanted freedom, Which was especially sinister of her because my dad has a chronic heart condition. I decided to call the local hospital and my aunts and uncles to check if this was true: it wasn't. I maintained no contact, but my father kept calling daily, demanding I come home. At the same time, I got a call from the people who cared for my siblings until they passed, so I answered when I found time. This individual only heard the version of the story my father told and isn't familiar with my mother's true nature. he ended up spitting Quranic verses and hadiths at me. He begged me to apologize to my mother and go home, which my father was demanding me to do. With the death of my sibling being fresh, my hand was forced to call my mother and father and give them a BS apology. After this, I said I would go home on Monday.

I've been watching a lot of Dr. Ramani to see how to address this situation when I go home. I am conflicted about whether I should grey-rock my parents. At this stage, I want my 20s to be about growth and independence. I am aware I have so much life ahead of me, and I don't want to be in this toxic family any more than I have to. I am also a practicing Muslim, and this has affected my relationship with the religion, and I still wish to maintain being a Muslim. I'm sorry about how poorly written this is, but I'm so frustrated about constantly being forced to apologize when I'm not in the wrong. I'm tired of them using my sibling's death to manipulate me because I was now ""their only hope."" I am tired of being so at peace when I'm by myself for people to tell me that I should go back to the hell that is my parents simply because ""they had a dream that Allah was upset with me."" I don't know how much I can take before leaving this state entirely and cutting ties with every family member. I have so much unspeakable rage about this situation, and I want to cut them out of my life, but I come from a culture that won't let me and a religion that frowns upon that. Help :(

**HERE IS THE PARAGRAPH I CANT ADD THE IMAGE:** Hi mommy, I'm sorry I've been very distant with you. I really didn't like it when you yelled at me on the phone the day you found out I had a vice president position for the X. I was really hurt at the way you insulted me and called me names, for something that I did to benefit my application to medical school and make you guys proud. You don't tend to be open to hearing other people's side of the story and it makes it hard for me to want to tell you what's going on, because I honestly don't feel like getting attacked. Which is why I gave you distance, because academics are already stressful enough. All I ask if for your support and positive advice. I don't blame you for anything, because I understand that you only want the best for me, and I'm very appreciative, but please if you can just be more gentle when you're critiquing me or giving me advice, it would go such a long way. I also understand if you are still upset with me, because not keeping you in the loop isn't acceptable. I take full responsibility for that, and it won't happen again. That was just my way of focusing on what I have in front of me (school). I'll call you this weeke if you don't mind. I love you"
"I was subjected to extensive physical and emotional abuse as a child along with my siblings. More recently, some siblings starting piecing together things that indicated there could have been childhood SA too. 

It has always been this way, but especially now, being around my dad has made me extremely emotionally distressed, I either have mini panic attacks before or after the interactions and just so much anxiety overcomes me anytime he calls and leaves me voicemails. I am pregnant and just moved in with my boyfriend (of 3 years) to get ready to welcome the baby and he makes comments that are really disturbing (“repeating how good I look and keeps begging to see the new place”). 

He also always guilt trips me into trying to visit my 90year old grandmother who I have no connection to whatsoever (she was also abusive in childhood, very racist in childhood toward me) (I am in a biracial relationship). 

He has addiction issues, and this year his affluence he has gotten him out of yet another DUI, and he has a rehab experience where I went to a “family therapy” session where his therapist literally told me to ONLY say good things that he has done for me and talk about how great he is because they use a “strengths based model” for recovery.

I feel really unsafe. I am in therapy trying to work through all of this, but it seems like I can’t break down that final wall to work through it with him still around in any capacity. I just don’t feel safe to talk about it or tap into any emotional material. 

I am thinking for the first time in my 27 years about cutting him off. I am the only sibling who really has a relationship anymore, but I have never been this distressed.

(((To clarify, the reason why we can’t prove certain types of abuse is because all of us siblings have very broken memories from all the trauma.)))"
"If there are any people who have or have had good parents and a normal sweet non abusive childhood here, what is it like? I'm genuinely curious, how do your conversations with your parents go? If there's ever a fight, do your parents actually acknowledge your feelings or ever apologize if they've made a mistake? How close have you gotten with your parent(s)?? How much are your parents involved in your education or future plans? As depressing as it might be, I kinda want to know what I've been missing out on. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for the life i have because of some aspects, I'm just curious is all :)) Hope everyone has great day "
"My parents just beat me to the pulp. My dad choked the life out of me. He pressed my face against the pillow and I felt suffocated and wanted to die. They took my spectacles away and I have a severe headache rn because of it. I have locked myself in the bathroom because I m afraid of getting out. I have a knife with me inside. But ik if they both attack me again, I will be dying. I can't handle their toxicity, my mom calls me a whore and slut ( she herself slept with her cousin) and my dad( cheated on my mom) keeps making me feel like shit. Its not even about the pain I m suffering with them right now anymore, they both have messed up my mental health for my future life and ik tht I will never be sane. I hate the person that I gave become and I can't do this anymore. My dad once bit me so hard on my arm that it left a big brown mark. I would attack the photo of it but it is not allowing me to? Because of them and somewhat myself I have fucked up fantasies( including being wanted to rape). I think it's because i understand tht nobody will ever love me and I don't deserve love. So getting abused is the only option I have. If in future my husband also beats me up, I think I will take it because i will beleive its ok to do so. Please I don't want to be this kind of person. I can't do this anymore, I would rather die than become this kind of person"
"My dad claims he went easy on me as a kid and that his spanking were nothing compared to what he got. Most of the people I know would not consider spanking to be abusive or traumatic. It's mostly regarded as usual where I am from, and even encouraged.  However, I do have a lot of bad memories from my childhood that involved spanking. My mother has Borderline personality disorder, and my father has anger issues; spanking and being forced to lie down in my bed and be quiet for time periods that ranged from minutes to hours were the only punishments my parents used on me as a kid. My dad spanked me with belts and cheap plastic flyswatters. My mom would spank me and my siblings hard with her bare hands. 

Many of the spankings I got as a kid did not make sense. I remember being scared of my parents and always on tiptoes because it did not take much to earn a spanking. I remember periods of my childhood when I was spanked nearly every day. I remember my dad spanking me with a belt a bunch of times on my legs and yelling at me when I was four because I accidentally walked in on him and my mom arguing. They accused me of eavesdropping on their conversations, which resulted in me getting the belt. I remember my dad spanking me a bunch of times on my legs with a flyswatter when I was 7 for asking my grandparents for a snack after I had already eaten. He was mad at me for wanting food after I had already eaten and for making him “look bad,” I think? I have another memory of my mom bathing me when I was nine, and she made me get in the shower when it was freezing cold. I squealed when the water hit my skin because of the extreme temperature. This angered my mom, and she slapped me so hard on my butt that her spikey diamond ring cut me, and I bled. 

I have several memories of my parents forcing me to get naked from the waist down and spanking me with a belt several times. I remember feeling humiliated and afraid. I did not like my parents seeing me naked and bent over, especially not my dad. My parents did this to me for everyday child things. I remember my parents spanking me with a belt naked from the waist down in front of both of them and my sister because I put shampoo in my doll's hair and lied about it because I was afraid of being spanked by my parents. They did this to me another time because I put a potato in the cat's litter box to pretend it was poop and prank my grandpa that his cat took a giant poop. They would also did this to me once because they heard me complain about a chore. My parents wanted to spank me naked from the waist down to make it hurt more and to see the redness from the belt forming on my bare butt. They may have also done it to humiliate me.

Most of the spankings I got as a kid did not result in injuries besides redness on my skin. However, I can remember at least three occasions where I had welts or broken skin from a harsh spanking on my legs. I remember having welts on my legs from getting whipped with a hickory switch. I remember another time when I had welts from the plastic flyswatter. I remember one time my mom stripped me naked from the waist down, or it was fully nude. I cannot remember, but she spanked me so hard that I screamed and cried from the pain and humiliation. I could not sit without pain for two days, but I had no bruising that I can remember, just a lot of redness that lasted days."
"My parents left me and my brothers in a mall in a foreign country 5 hours with no food and water,and when they came back they said we were being selfish and they had things to be do .I thought they got hurt in a car crash or something I was on the verge of [tears.Am](http://tears.Am) 14f and my brothers are 11 and 16."
I can’t give you my sob story about how abusive and horrible my mom is. i need help on knowing if i run away to my grand parents will the cops get involved? i dont wanna do this but i have to and im scared she’ll call the cops and get cps to take me and my siblings away again. tbh no one fights for us in court but she beats me and my siblings and we have no family or no good people. i have my grand parents but they’re old and my sister is a pre teen girl who thinks money comes from trees and a talk with her will make her shut down and lash out at everyone and my brother doesn’t have the same dad as me. i don’t know what to do i feel like my teen years are over. im tired of the abuse . the marks . the night terrors and feeling like a outcast bc i dont have loving parents how can i get away from this
"i keep having breakdowns and episodes of mania, delusions and hallucinations spurred on by how my parents treat me. i don't want to go into detail but im just so frustrated with where my life is. i cant get out because i'm less than a year from being considered a child worth helping, but i can't leave once i' 18 because they won't let me get my ID . its all so frustrating to be stuck with no way out but even if i try and make my situation better it only gets worse. my entire family just yelled at me-- one of them waking up to yell at me. its so so frustrating, i didn't say anything to anyone all day and they're still mad at me. im angry and im starving, im so hungry. i honestly don't know what to do, i feel like i'm lost and i'll never be happy."

My mom told me that she had ordered my mouth piece to my sax at the beginning of summer then like a week before school started she said that she had lied and she didn’t order it because she didn’t want to hear me practicing over the summer, then I told her to order it before school started and she said she did, then when school starts she said she hadn’t ordered it but it doesn’t matter because she has prime so wtvr she orders will be here before my first A day, my first A day comes around and I still don’t have my fucking mouth piece so I have to use Darriens tenor mouth piece, and since I wasn’t able to practice over the summer I forgot how to blow into my saxophone so I was put in beginning band, an entire week goes by of me telling my mom I need my mouth piece because dr kinder doesnt have one for a tenor and she told me literally two days ago that she ordered it and that the one she ordered wasn’t eligible for prime, I told her today that dr kinder said that she is going to kick me out of band if I don’t have a mouth piece by Monday, she left me on seen for 6 hours, then when I get home and shower she’s comes home and I ask her if she saw what I said and she said yeah then 15 minutes later I come out my room and ask if she ordered it and she said no and I said but you said she did and she said in this playful voice like she was fucking making fun of me “I lied” then turned her head and smiled, and my sister is right next to her, I leave the room crying because I know I’m going to get kicked out of band because my mom is never going to buy the mouth piece and I can hear her and my sister laughing and giggling and having so much fun after seeing their sibling/child cry knowing they’ve ruined the one fun thing I could’ve done at school that I was promised all year (I played 7th and 8th grade, was made to quit 9th, I’m in my sophmore year)"
"My mother likes to come to my house, with three small dogs.

I’ve asked her to not bring the dogs and put them in a kennel, as she refuses to keep them outside. She lives away from me so can’t keep them at her place when visiting. 

She is coming to mine in a week and has asked if she could bring one dog, and I said no.

She passive aggressively said that she would dagger bring them somewhere where the dogs are welcomed and hung up the phone.

What should I do? What can I say to her or message her? Am I in the wrong here? "
"last night i was sitting in an empty parking lot after getting off a 12 hr shift at one am with no where to go after being threatened and yelled at all day at work n getting warned not to come home unless i wanna have a black eye n another broken bone but everything will be fine in the morning. genuinely starting to believe they’re right n id be better if i was just gone. i dont even recognize myself, i hate everything about me. i dont even feel real, im living someone else’s life. i can’t believe im 18 and my whole life i was just trying to survive, i just want to feel safe and loved for just once, i just want to experience it just once im begging atp. i just dont understand. so tired of living this life. i’m so lost i have no idea who i am, my parents keep taking more and more money from me, im working 50-60 hrs a week and i can’t even keep the money, they already owed me THOUSANDS of dollars by the time i was 16. i just want to leave but i need to save up money but i can’t. i don’t know what to do. anyways thanks for listening to my vent so i dont crash out again☺️"

"almost every time i go out i get harassed or followed and my mom will always blame me. 

one time when I was 16 i did the biggest mistake which was go to her for support. 

we were on vacation and under the hotel was a mall, I wanted to complete my 10k steps so I told her id go to the mall to walk. I wore sweats and no makeup. I looked like shit and someone followed me and harassed me and I got really scared. i called my mom and received no support. a few days later we had a screaming fight and she told me that the reason why I got followed was bc I was 'asking for it' she said I wanted to get attention bc I'm a whore and if I wore the hijab then I wouldn't get followed. she said I wear too much makeup for men. i wasn't wearing makeup that day and my clothes were so baggy. she screamed that and she said so many hurtful things that I cant forgive her for. she told me shell pray that I die. my mom thinks I'm a whore because I get harassed. 

two years later, this still happens to me and I don't know who to call to when it happens. i have to deal with it on my own and that's the scariest thing.

"I (23 F) am getting married in January and I am trying to decide if I should let my mother come. My hesitation to invite my mom is due to concerns that she will yet again choose her husband over me. So therefore if I want her to come her husband has to come to, which I don't want because when I was younger my mom's husband would abuse me verbally and physically. This caused me to fall into a deep depression and have body dysmorphia. He would constantly sexually exploit and even though I had proof of this and would constantly come to my mom for help she would always tell me that I was lying and would never take my word for it. Now that years have passed since this has happened I have tried to have a relationship with my Mom (and I really want to), especially now that I'm getting married. I want her I be in those moments you need for, like going wedding dress shopping and helping put into it on my wedding day. I just want to have my mom at my wedding but she continues to choose him over me and proceeds to tell me that I've been lying all these years about what has happened. Now I can't decide if I should let the past be the past and be the bigger person, even though I have yet to receive an apology and yet to be told that she believes me and just let them come to my wedding or should I be petty and not invite them?"
"Hello, redditors. I just wished to ask what i can do if i get beaten by my stepfather and verbally abused. Just for a bit of example about how, i just got scolded earlier. I forgot to turn off one of the fans in our house and got hit on the back of my head by surprise. Due to that and many more things i was a bit stressed and hot headed, and my sibling came down and asked him with an angry face ""What do you want"" he said he needs to pee so yeah i cared no longer. He was still dawdling so i told him to go up. He snitched to my stepfather (his real father) and he got so angry he said ""never do that again or ill remove your teeth, one punch is all it takes and you'll go to school with a missing tooth"". I also get kicked and punched on the arms when i get scolded (it leaves no physical evidence which is my problem). During quarantine i also had a lot of due assignments and my parents found out (i was lying telling them i finished it all). It was because i was having a hard time adjusting to online classes and i tried to tell them that i was, but the didnt understand. I just ended up being punched on the solar plexus and it felt like i was gonna pass out. I don't know what to do. I know i was wrong but being treated like this makes me wanna kill myself.

"I (17F) live in india with my parents. The problem of having brown parents is that they won't let u work if you're a girl, even if they go entirely broke. We had been trying for an American visa for the past 17 years (before I was born) I have two more sisters now ages 14 and 6 both born in india. In November 2023 we finally got our visit visas and we were in America by December. My grandparents have been living in America since a long time and my uncle and aunt went to America and were settled there a few months before we went. After we were in America our grandparents started treating us badly (they have always treated my mother badly) it's just the same brown household story. My mom has been doing so much for them but they're never grateful for it. After 2 months we had finally had enough, we were suffering financially and emotionally. Our studies also suffered while being there, also we had a better relationship with my mom side, who were in india. Finally me, my sisters and my mom decided to come back home. My dad stayed for a few months so that he could help my grandfather financially and also help us here in india. My uncle started living with my aunt's family. And said that he won't help my grandparents financially. My aunt's, uncle, grandparents basically most of my dad side stopped talking to my mom. She was emotionally hurt and i couldn't see her like that. Fast forward to now, I'm giving my 12th board examination, as i missed them in February I'm giving them now in july, after my 12th i wanted to do a culinary arts degree, but that's too expensive and my parents won't let me work. Now I'm doing a baking and pastry diploma, which has been my main focus, they're paying for it by borrowing money from others, they have constantly been telling me ""we're paying for ur education so stop going out with your friends"", ""we're investing a lot of money in this you better be grateful"" and stuff like that. I really wanna do this diploma but if they're gonna do this to me I'm legit gonna break. Idk what to do for my graduation either, they wanna put me in an all girls college and I do not want that at all, they won't let me go out with my friends either, I don't get pocket money, nor do they let me have a job. What should I do??? Please help me😔"
"My parents are abusive parents in disguise, I hate it I wanna kill myself, maybe that would be more peaceful,my dad, never talks to me nicely, and if I don't talk to him nicely after he just mentally abused me by using abusive language, my mom would beat me up, and emotionally abuse me by saying it's my fault and would stop taking to me, last night she was yapping about how we as daughters have to give my dad a glass of water as soon as he arrives, I was doing the dishes, but she was just telling me this, my other sister was in her phone, when I told her why do you always tell me u have 2 more daughters, she lunges towards me hits me with a plastic bottle straight on my elbow, my elbow got an electric shock, i couldn't move it, and i was screaming in pain and all my dad did was stare at me with his hands on his hips while my mom continues to kick me further, I was screaming in pain and he said I was acting so that they don't take away my phone, he continued to say I was just over reacting, when I didn't stop screaming my mom checked my hand it couldn't move, she applied ice on it, I was still screaming and she said to not over react, i couldn't bare the pain I was in my elbow is not functioning since, they still say I'm acting, all I did was speaking dry to my dad, my dad used abusive language again, and my mother slapped me because of that. Now she won't speak to me and makes me feel like it's my fault, this happens every time, I have to beg for their forgiveness everytime and if I say that do u guys even realise YOUR mistake?, they say parents don't say sorry. I can't anymore, I have pent up all these emotions inside me I don't even know who do i discuss this with, I can't do this anymore, i hate this."
hi all. i feel like venting relieves all the built up stress and negativity. so i m looking for venting partner to talk abt my abusive parents and also to get advice of how to tackle them. dm me.
"I [21f] am at a dilemma, my abusive mother is still content on making me miserable even after cutting contact. 
She's a narssistic heavy alcoholic with a bad drug problem, she's [43] years old. unfortunately my little brother [now 15] couldn't move in with me and my dad because of his age she still has full custody of him. I moved out the day after I turned 18 and the guilt of leaving him behind eats at me everyday. My dad however has custody on the weekends so at least we still get to see him. I didn't cut full contact with my Mom for the first year I moved out because she'd find some way to ruin both my dad's and my brother's life out of spite if I didn't continue to communicate with her. She's also still mad at me for ""leaving her"" and blames all of her downfalls on me (which is nothing new). 

My problem is that somehow my mother always finds a way to manipulate me into submitting to her every will. I can't enjoy my life stuck as a puppet, because of everything she's put me through im mentally fucked for the rest of my life. I just wanna break away from it all. I just want to move on and live my life. [Just hearing her voice let alone being anywhere near her still makes me shake in fear]

But no I still have to play negotiator and hostage with my own mother. She knows I don't care about my own life but knows who I care about and so she will try to find ways to hurt anyone i care about without any remorse if it means it'll hurt me in the end. I've done nothing but tried everything I could to make her happy my whole life but she's just never satisfied with me. It's like she hates my guts and damns me for ever being born. I had to block her on my socials because she'd continue to send me things like ""How could you be so cold to your own mother"" ""Your mother is the victim and your selfishness only hurts her more"" and then messages that I'm a ""Selfish bitch"" and more.
 
Now she's harassing other family members with said messages about me and refuses to stop until I talk to her. I would love to talk and possibly finally find some kind of closure for myself out of it but it's like talking to a damn wall. [I've tried talking to her many times before i moved out but she'd immediately get defensive when I'd confront her about her actions. She cant admit that she's ever in any wrong. ] All she wants is to yell at me and talk about herself, digging for pity points from me and to make me feel like shit. Because of her harassment towards some of my family they have been pleading me to speak with my mother as if I can make her stop. I don't know how to make her leave me alone without it effecting my father and little brother. [Note: she has threatened many times that she'll ""kidnap"" my brother and move to a different state so that we'll never see him again]

"I apologize in advance for my grammar, I’m Swedish and English is my second language. Also I'm new to reddit, sorry for any errors!  
  
I really need some relationship advice! AITA if I ask my father for a paternity test?

My (F36) mom (F73) seriously dropped the ball on me this year. We have always had a strained relationship. To summarize, my mother are very immature and narcissistic. When I was a child my parents went through a really destructive divorce. There was accusations of grape, my abusive father selling explicit pictures of my older sisters to -those- kind of people, my equally abusing mother developing münchhausen by proxy and lots more. I ran away from home at 15 and haven’t lived with any of my parents since. I’ve been in therapy off and on all of my adult life, and had the chance to work though most of the trauma (or so I thought). At 26 years old I moved with my husband to the literal other side of the country and have since lived a calm and happy life. I’m the only sibling of 7 who keeps in contact with both our parents. Depending on life it’s been more or less contact, but at the start of this year I spoke with my mother on the phone a few times a week. Mostly about day to day life. I usually put her on speaker and let her talk about her dramas while I did household work or walked the dog. One reason being that she then usually didn’t bother my siblings too much, because she got the attention she needed from me.

In February mom told me she met someone (Let’s call him K). I was surprised. Her last relationship was over 20 years ago (with a man who tried to groom me and my sisters). She was somewhat secret about this new man until she suddenly got a cancer scare on a mammogram appointment. It turned out to be nothing, but she decided to spill a huge secret: That the man she started to meet is supposedly (no DNA test done yet) my oldest sister's (F45) father, who we’ve never heard of before. We’ve known all our lives that my oldest sister had another father (Let’s call him M). But suddenly my super prude mom starts introducing K to my siblings (the ones who still live in her town).

My twin sister, who is a bit of a detective, starts to research the guy and find out that he and mom went to nursing school together in the late 70’s. He lives in the next town over, is married, and have adult children. Which my sister tells mom, who in turn asks him about his wife. K tells my mom that he lives with his wife, and they’ve tried to divorce for years but due to super mysterious circumstances they never succeed. My mom, delusional as always, decides to believe his quite obvious lie and continues to openly date him. During this time I keep contact with mom and I’m stupidly enough trying to be some voice of reason for her, but I fail miserably. I tell her I won’t judge her for looking for love, but she at least shouldn’t lie to herself - he is married and if she choose to believe his lies it’s on her. Mom then asks me to contact K’s wife and ask her if K is lying, and I refuse to because me doing that seems bonkers to me! My oldest sister just don’t care about all of this and keeps her distance to both of them.

Fast forward to June. K and mom decide to drive all the way down to my county (about 16 hours drive) to visit family for a mini vacation (not visiting me and hubby, because I really don’t want a man I don’t know to stay the night at my house and I tell mom as such). Instead we agreed to meet at a relatives house, about 2 hours drive from my place. Mom is really excited for me to meet her new catch.

That fateful morning I got in the car and drove over. My hubby had work to do so I went alone. And the moment I step inside that door it’s…weird. My mom, who usually can’t leave me alone, just sits at the kitchen table and doesn't even get up to greet me. She almost looks close to tears. K does get up and give me a brisk handshake. I think nothing special of him. He looks and talks just like any 70+ man I’ve met and I’m not shocked that he didn’t turn out to be that 2m tall, strong harlequin romance cover photo man my mom described all year. 

Our relative (my moms cousin) makes us delicious crepes and I exchange pleasantries with her and her husband. In the corner of my eye I see K and mom running back and forward from the kitchen to the guest room, barely saying two words to me. When we sat down to eat, he just makes two super sexist and awkward jokes (which me and the relatives didn’t laugh at because eeeeew!) and then he storms off. I decide that enough is enough, thanks my moms cousin for lunch and begin to leave. K rushes to put on his shoes before I do, which feels odd. And when I get to my car he and my mom are on the front lawn obviously arguing. I don’t stay, but I pull off a bit down the road and text her asking if everything is ok and if she needs me to pick her up. She may have hurt me a lot in life but I’ll be damned if I leave someone to be abused! She never answered that text. I stop briefly again and call my twin sister to calm my nerves. And she suddenly tells me that she can see my mom on google maps, moving north. With her location, they’d had to start driving from my moms cousin the same second I did.

Then I get a text from my oldest sister, who asks if anyone knows whats going on. So, to conclude a long story: The day my mom and K left moms house, someone had sent a letter to his wife. When she received it, she called him, obviously furious. And he rushed home, with my desperate mother in tow. 

I was furious too. I had been so worried about her when they just took off like that. When I spoke to mom again I asked her why they did that and she gave me a BS excuse of K’s son having some gambling habit and they had to go save him(?). Me and my siblings are convinced that my mom sent that letter. But it doesn’t matter what I ask my mom she won’t tell me the truth (so for my mental health I don’t ask her anymore). I understand that he was so disrespectful to me when we met was because he knew about the letter then and assumed that I had sent it!

The letter his poor wife got was horrible! My oldest sister got a photo of the thing from K, so obviously I’ve seen it too and It is basically a hand written note that translates to something like:

‘You should know that your husband is with my mom. I’m very protective of my mom. Are you still married?’

Included in the envelope was a badly printed divorce paper.

I’m so SO angry with my mom. I can’t describe it. I’ve been angry, sad and disappointed with her many many times (especially when I ran away from home at 15!) but nothing compares to this. I’ve set up and had a few appointments with a therapist, but it’s slow work. I just don’t know how to handle this. All my childhood traumas just hurricaned back into my body and I have the worst sleep paralysis and night terrors! I’ve worked for years to have a civil relationship with her and she just throws me under the bus like this!

I feel like I’m questioning too much at the moment. When my twin sister came to visit me the subject arose about our own parentage. Are our dad really our dad? Mom is adamant that he is, but she (presumably) kept quiet about K for 45 years. And we would really want to do a DNA test with our dad… but my dad is super abusive to my siblings (not me, I’m his golden child) when getting the chance and I really REALLY don’t want to subject them to that. I don’t know how to ask for a test without having to explain why...and if I do I’m afraid he’ll turn his attention to my oldest sister. And if he is’nt my dad…was all that horror of my childhood just… I don’t know!

Please, if anyone out there got any advice - I really need it right now!

"throwaway account

I'm from the UK and recently turned 15m my mother is 38 leading up to this starting from the age of 10-11 I wasn't in school my mum took me out and put me in ""homeschooling"" lasted about a month before she got tired of it and stopped havent done any schooling since I should also say my mum doesn't hit me often when I was younger till around 8 or 9 she would but then stopped idk why but it changed to things like making me drink soap or locking me in a room and verbal things saying I wish you were never born,your worthless,that I didn't help enough she is a drug user weed cocaine excessive amounts of alcohol casually she could drink a litre bottle of vodka in 2 days anyways to the day of the incident

did I cause it I don't know what to think anymore"
That's it. That's hopefully it. My sister and I have left the house. My parents put up a fight but we fought harder. We are currently the airport. We have booked  early morning tickets to our home country. We have somewhat of a plan but yeah. I'm happy. We're somewhat elated. It's somewhat weird because I feel so many things rn. 
"This is my first time posting so hopefully I’m doing this right. 
I (17 F) have already had a rough childhood with my dad being an abuse alcoholic, being held at gun point, SA so on so forth. After my brother passed we moved to Pennsylvania and my parents were fine for a while. Till about two years ago I’ll say, my dad tried burning down my house with me and my sister inside. When I called my mom about it, crying to her she told me to get over it and she’s busy. (When she means busy she meant she was fucking another man) so I called the cops on my dad. My mom THEN came home and explained that I, Was being dramatic and my dad would never do such things. (He was the one that put a gun to my head) 
Luckily my dad made the decision to go to rehab, which helped a lot. 
Fast forward to this year 2024, my dad left because he couldn’t deal with my mom anymore. She’s only nice to my younger sister. She makes me clean up the house when literally nothing is mine. My mom’s UNDERWEAR is on the floor. Why the living fuck would I pick that shit up? OH AND I’m Christian (not perfect) but she’s always telling me My God isn’t real and I’m delusional. That I could be over dramatic about but it makes me mad. She complains that I do nothing with my life and I’m fat and useless. I work at a hospital and I do assistant nursing and work 12 hour shifts. My mom told me the other day that I should kill myself or she’d do it for me all because I forgot to do that dishes. She has put her hands on me. Yesterday she came into my room as I was changing and I told her to please knock cause that’s just the nice thing to do. She yelled at me saying it was her house and she can do whatever she wants and I need to get over it. Then she looked me up and down with a disgusting look and said “you need to lose weight my god your ugly” 
..I weigh 104😐
The only way I’m getting through all of this, is from my boyfriend and my best friend. Mainly my boyfriend and his family. My mom is no longer letting me eat and I have to start paying rent and buy my own groceries. My boyfriend and his family pick me up from work, make me dinner, give me a place to stay when I can’t be home. My best friend helps me get to my doctor appointments and helps me do homework when I’m unable too. And with their help Im saving enough money to move out. I’m turning 18 in November and I’m making 19$ an hour, my paychecks are 800$ and I work almost every day. I’m going to school for aerospace engineering next year at the best aerospace engineering school in the country and im already a pilot. So am I set? 
please give me your opinion. Am I in the wrong? Do I need to fix myself? Should I move out while still in high school? "
"(Sorry for any bad grammar, or misspelled words) 
I was sitting with my parents in our lounge room, and they were talking about “funny memories”, (which I in no way found funny) one of them being a memory from when I was SIX which they’ve brought up a couple of times where I’ve been able to fight my emotions, but this time I couldn’t. The memory they were mentioning was a time I was throwing a tantrum as a SIX YEAR OLD in the car and I wouldn’t let my mom buckle my seatbelt, where she had shouted “What the hell is wrong with you!” And after giving up she screamed “Fine, I don’t f**king care if you die in a car accident!” And I just started crying my eyes out. It wasn’t just the memory, but the fact they were just laughing about it like as if it didn’t change my childhood at all, it stung. She never even told me she was sorry.
I know it’s been seven years and I should get over it, but I just can’t seem to forget about what she said. It doesn’t help I have photographic memory.
 I’m sorry if this came off as over dramatic and not enough evidence to tell if they’re abusive, but I’ll probably make a post in the future trying to show more evidence."
"So I have limited memory of my childhood. Significant memory loss due to trauma. And the fragmented memories I do have aren’t exactly good memories. 
My father and mother screamed at each other and it often got really violent. One memory I have is them arguing while I was at a friend’s house. I heard yelling and things breaking in the kitchen so I went to see what was happening. I turn into the kitchen to see my father choking my mother against a wall. Luckily my friend’s father stepped in and got him off of her and the police was called. I was about 7.
The arguments and the violence continued. They eventually separated. And a while after that, I was at home with my mother. She was helping me with my homework. And there were knocks at the door. We looked to see and it was two police officers. She said to ignore them so I did. But they kept knocking more and more. It was scaring me so I went to the bathroom to get away and when I came out of the bathroom the police officers had my mom on the floor of the living room and she was fighting back. They kept tazing her over and over until she was down and they put her into the back of a police car. My father showed up and took us away. Turns out he called the police on her for DV. They eventually officially got a divorce, starting the years and years of custody battles and what my mom called “The War” But my mom had us practice what we were going to say and the abuse that happened. 
But my father kept fighting for custody. No matter what. My mom, brother and I all legally changed our last names when I was 15 so that we didn’t have the same last name as him. And we moved across the country. Once I turned 18 my mom seemed so happy saying that he finally couldn’t fight for custody. I hadn’t seen my father since I was 10 years old. And I haven’t had any contact with any extended family on either side because of my mother. And when we moved I thought everything was fine. Until I finished high school and moved away. I joined the military. I then came out to my mom as bisexual and told her I had been questioning my gender. I thought she’d be supportive. I was very much wrong about that. She told me I wasn’t allowed home. That she’d kill herself because of me. She then told me she threw out all of my personal items (my stuffed animals and my artwork). She also had my birth certificate and title to my car and said she won’t give it to me unless I “let this go”. And I told her I would not. 
A week after I came out, my friend took me on a hike to cheer me up and on the hike lost his footing and fell off a 30 foot cliff. I called 911 and directed the first responders to his body. He was paralyzed from the waist down. I didn’t know who to call after that and I needed to talk to someone so I called my mom and she told me that it was my fault. “You shouldn’t have been doing something stupid. It’s your fault your friend is hurt.” I hung up. I then didn’t speak to her for a while.
I didn’t speak to her for months actually. I attempted to kill myself twice. Took sleeping pills. It was the lowest I had ever felt. And then I was sent on my first deployment. I wanted to go. Anything to not be where I was. 
And honestly the deployment was shit but it was what I needed. No contact with the outside world.
I came back and I continued the no contact with my mother. Not talking to her honestly felt like a breath of fresh air. It was like feeling happiness for the first time. Until I started getting messages from her.
The messages were all over the place. Anti-trans articles. Her telling me how horrible I am. And then begging me to come back. Every single message broke my heart all over again and brought me right back to the dark place I had gotten out of. 
And then I got news that my family cat was sick and dying and I called her to say goodbye cause I loved that cat to pieces. And honestly that conversation went so nice. It was the first conversation in years that we had that we didn’t end up in an argument. It gave me hope that we could have a normal relationship. But I was being deployed again so I couldn’t have consistent contact. On top of she refuses to apologize for what happened. She said she will not apologize for something she thinks is right. And that she thinks “this LGBT stuff” is mental illness and she’s not going to support that or apologize for hurting me. So I told her that I would need an apology before I think about having a relationship with her again. She refused. And so I went back to not being in contact with her. I occasionally still get emails about how I’m horrible and ungrateful and how she wished she never had me and how she’ll kill herself because of me. 
And then she calls me. I decided to pick up for some reason. And she yells at me for an hour and a half straight saying I needed to “let this go”. And how dare I throw away this family. That she is still my mother and I needed to talk to her. And then she said something that I haven’t been able to get out of my head. She said “I should’ve left you with your father if I knew you would turn out like this”. And instantly I was just…. dumbfounded. And I said “You would’ve left me with an abusive father?”. She said yes. That he “would have never hurt me”. I hung up. I remember the abuse he inflicted upon her. And the abuse also was directed at me. And she would’ve left me with him if she knew I was queer? 
I then went on a little self investigation. Found him on facebook. And found years and years of posts about me. And in these posts he says that I was brainwashed by my mother to believe he was abusive. That my mother was a narcissist who brainwashed me against him.
At this point I don’t know what to believe. I am 23 years old. It’s been 13 years since I last saw my father. It’s been 4 years since I saw my mother. Currently not in contact with either of them. Should I talk to my mother under the “but she’s still my mother” idea. But then wouldn’t the same apply to a father. And what happened in the past? The abuse? Or was it all a lie made by my mother?
I left a lot of details out cause it’s already really long but you get the idea."
"My father was very abusive up until when I was 17, and then he left with no words. My mother was only verbally abusive during this period, but her abuse was very light compared to my fathers, and I feel like I could kinda tell it was not really ""sincere"" and she never meant to hurt me (still did though). Now, I am almost done with college, and whenever I am home, she is always relatively nice, but I still feel anxious around her and cant make conversation, and I even find myself always sitting in a different room than her to avoid her. She really hasnt done anything bad in the past year and I cant get over the past in my head. I make up terrible scenarios in my head and I am so defensive 24/7 when I am home, but when I am at college, I feel fantastic, almost as if I can forget I was ever abused in the past. WHy is this? I want a normal relationship with my mother now. I feel like the biggest part of my resentment toward her is the fact that she never talked about what happened with my father when he left. You would think a normal person would mention that, but she completely ignored it meanwhile I suffered the consequences and had to suffer in silence. Can anyone help?"
"May I just start this out by saying my dad is the biggest college freak I know. I vividly remember telling him excitedly that I wanted to go to art school and pursue a career in script writing and animation as I had fallen in love with a show called gravity falls when I was younger that deeply inspired me. For the next three hours after that he would lecture me and tell me how art school would turn me into a stripper begging for money. I understand it's an unrealistic dream but I was in middle school, barely even thirteen. 

Now as of recent, I might have dug my own grave here. I have always been an A-B student. Sometimes I get all A’s but then just a B in math and it's been like that my whole life, up until my junior year which plummeted my (unweighted) gpa down to a 3.6. I never told my parents this. They know I practically flunked math but they only know that my gpa (WEIGHTED) is a 4.0 so they're pleased. 

Before I proceed I just want to say my parents have high expectations of me. My mom went to NYU and my dad went to Duke both as immigrant students (we aren't rich btw every time I say this everyone assumes I'm a legacy who's parents are able to donate millions of dollars to institutions when in reality we barely get by). And I obviously have yet to live up to all of that. 

My original plan was to raise my marking period one or semester one grade to help my gpa prior to early admissions which my dad wants to help me apply to. The only thing is I just found out this isn't possible since early admissions happens before semester one ends. 

I'm so fucked and I know this is only months away but I can already feel the beating my father is going to give me and I'm so scared I can hardly speak. I can feel him digging into my hair and hitting me and I just want to sob and hide. I don't know what to do. "
"My parent has been physically and verbally abusive to me and my siblings, once almost sending my little brother to the hospital. (Nosebleed). He's the one who taught me how you roll a blunt (He didn't give me the drug) and how to take advantage of other people and how to charm them. But he acted out of anger towards us. He's still my dad though. He is not angry all the time. He doesn't act like this on a daily bases. He used to be like this. These days he's kind. I can tell that he's getting older and weaker, but it's killing me. I feel guilty for even calling him abusive. Even though technically he very much so was. It makes me feel even worse when he talks about buying us stuff. Like yesterday he showed me something very expensive and I suspect he might actually buy it for me. I just feel guilty for my resentment sometimes. I keep telling myself, at least you have a father not everybody has that, my father didn't have one either. He is trying his best. I feel like an ungrateful brat. Am I ungrateful? (I have parental controls on my phone so I'll delete this pretty soon)"
"Soo I was living at my brother's place for summer holidays , because I couldn't stand living with my mum , there are around 6 people inside a 3 bedroom house not counting me, and two of those people don't even work and do nothing in the house, and one of them even threatened to hit me, he even almost slammed a door in my face once but I dodged it , (this has been happening to me four a couple. Of years I always tell my mum but nothing changes) Soo thats when I decided to move to my brother's place just to relax on summer holiday, I stayed there some weeks and I asked my mum if i could live there. We had a discussion I told her she didn't care about me, cuz if she did, she would actually change things inside the house. And she didn't let me live there, Soo I went back home a couple of weeks later. And as soon as I stepped inside the house I just had a full blown panick attack, I was crying and shaking and just couldn't talk to anyone, my mum got mad cuz I wasn't answering her and she just started hitting me, and then she ''passed out'' and woke up 1 min later. Long story short everyone was blaming me, for this and no one even asked if I was ok, and if I needed help they just started swearing at me for ""making her pass out""
And now I will need to support this hell hole until I'm 18. I'm just venting thx if you actually read it"
"Hello, so I'm 18M with long hair (for reference my reddit avatar pretty much has the same hair) I decided to start growing it about a year and half ago because I just like it better, but it has been constant struggle with my parents, I had to make many compromises because they kept telling me stuff like ""cut it just once more because we have to go to X and later you can just leave it be"" but that was just a lie, I refused to make ""compromises"" anymore and my parents became even more enraged (especially my father), last night my father got drunk and threw temper tantrum at me, berating me for having long hair and told me that he'll stop my allowance until I cut it because in his words ""I bust my ass working for you and you can't even cut your hair for me, that's it you won't get a penny more"" and now I don't know what to do, I love having long hair but I'm unemployed student and I can't afford that"
"This is a bit long but I want to vent here rather than continuing to talk about it with my spouse. My mom has been abusive to me for my entire life. I have a half-sister I was raised with as well, and my mom never treated her the way she treats me. Anyway, my mom had a huge abusive blow up toward me and my spouse last year and I've avoided her since. She reached out last year and I told her exactly why I didn't want to spend time with her and she turned it around on me and basically defended being abusive. She's been asking me to meet for lunch for over a year and I've declined each time. She asked again a few days ago and I said no. She then asked me to ""send her a letter"" outlining why I want nothing to do with her and that she thinks someone is trying to ""mind control"" me into not talking to her...LOL. 

  
I've had enough of her. I've been in therapy four about three years now. I tried going when I was 19/20 but the therapist suggested I share an article about gaslighting with my mom and when I showed my mom, she flipped out and threatened me so I wasn't able to share all of the trauma I had endured from her with the therapist because I was scared and still trying to get on my feet as an adult. Anyway, my mom is the biggest ""Karen"" for lack of better word. She loves reporting people, ""writing her congressman,"" speaking to the manager, reporting people for breaking the law, etc. So after her text I told her I would be happy to type up a letter with all of my grievances and have it notarized and file it with our local county courts so she could reference it if she had further questions, which I am actually still considering doing. 

  
I typed up and sent an email outlining most of the instances of abuse I could remember, and identified all illegal instances, and emailed it to her, which was very liberating. Afterward I blocked her from all accounts, phone numbers, etc. and I told my spouse I will take legal action against her if she continues to contact me. I've had enough of her gaslighting me. She would tell me I deserved the abuse and ""made her do it,"" and if I told people what she did, that they would wonder what I did to make her behave that way. Zero sense of personal responsibility. If she wants to continue to play dumb (which is one hundred percent the case because she talks of concerns of child abuse for others, which is insane because she is a quintessential abuser), then I will play with her. Sending the email made me feel liberated. There is way worse stuff that I didn't include, but will include if she continues to try to mess with my head. 

  
I've went on so long not writing down or reporting the abuse to anyone but my therapist or friends. My mom loves to start ""paper trails"" whenever someone does something she doesn't like, so I decided to give her a dose of her own medicine and it actually feels amazing and empowering. 

  
I want to add that I don't recommend anyone who isn't completely out of an abusive situation with a parent and can support themselves to do this because it could lead to retaliation, but in my case I'm not afraid of her anymore and I'm not afraid to share what she's done. "
"Hello there.

I’ve kept quiet about the hell I’ve been through for the longest time. But today, I’m done staying silent. I’m the oldest of two children, and I’m gay male on the autism spectrum. These things shouldn’t matter in a loving family, but they made me a target in mine.

Over the past five years, my mother has systematically torn me apart. It started small—little digs at how I didn’t listen to instructions or “too sensitive.” She’d put ideas in my head that I was the problem, that I was broken somehow. It was always subtle, but it was there, like a splinter under my skin.

But it didn’t stop there. My mother also made me believe that my father was the abusive one in our family. She’d tell me stories, heavily exaggerate situations, and twist things to paint him as the villain. As a kid, I didn’t know any better—I trusted her. I grew up thinking my dad was the reason our home felt so tense, that he was the one to fear. But after my parents divorced, everything changed. Without him around, her true nature became impossible to ignore.

Suddenly, I saw her for who she was—the one who was always in control, always pulling the strings. The more distance I got from my dad, the more I realized he wasn’t the monster she made him out to be. He had his flaws, sure, but he wasn’t abusive. It was her all along. She was the one who used manipulation, fear, and guilt to keep me under her thumb. She turned my world upside down, and for so long, I didn’t even see it.

To make things even worse, I’m pretty sure she never really understood me being gay at all. When I came out to her, she didn’t ask how I felt or try to understand what I was going through. Instead, she turned it around and made it about herself, like she always did. She acted like my being gay was something that happened to her, something that disrupted *her* life. It was just another excuse for her to play the victim, to make everything revolve around her needs, her feelings, her damn world. That’s exactly who she is—a narcissist through and through.

As time went on, the abuse escalated. She’d complain constantly that I never did things “the right way.” If I didn’t understand something immediately or needed extra time to process it, she’d lash out instead It was like living with a ticking time bomb; I never knew what would set her off. And when it did? She’d unleash all her frustration on me—physically, emotionally, mentally. There were times I was genuinely scared for my life, times I thought, “If I don’t get out now, I won’t make it.”

The emotional abuse was the hardest to endure. She knew exactly how to twist the knife, making me doubt myself, my worth, and my right to exist as I am. She’d tell me I was a burden, that my struggles were my fault, that I was lucky she didn’t throw me out. I started to believe her. I started to think maybe I was the problem, maybe I didn’t deserve better.

There were nights I’d lie awake, thinking about ending it all. I came close—too close—more times than I’d like to admit. But somehow, I held on, even when every part of me wanted to give up. I couldn’t let her win. I couldn’t let her destroy me completely. She was like this even before the divorce happened.

It took hitting rock bottom for me to realize I needed to get out. I’m on a self-healing journey now, one step at a time. It’s extremely hard, and some days I still hear her voice in my head, telling me I’m worthless. But I’m learning to drown it out with my voice, telling myself that I am enough, that I deserve peace, that I deserve to heal.

What’s helping me most right now is my music. I’m a musician—a composer, conductor, and entrepreneur. I’m working on building my own orchestra in my hometown, creating something beautiful out of all this pain. Music has always been my refuge, my way of expressing everything I couldn’t put into words. Now, it’s my way of healing. Every note I write, every piece I conduct, is a step forward in reclaiming my life. It’s what keeps me going, what makes me believe that I can find happiness again.

This post is my way of breaking the silence, of taking back my power. To anyone who’s gone through something similar, I see you. You’re not alone. You deserve better. We all do. You are valued, your feelings are valid, you are worthy. Thank you for reading my story; much love. ❤️❤️❤️

"For so long I thought I wasn't being verbally abused, and its still hard to accept. First I found it hard to consider differences between parent/child arguments to parent/child verbal abuse and then to accept that verbal abuse can occur in many different ways not just full emotional neglect/abandonment

My mother was verbally abused by my father for a long time and I never really gaged it, but she has told me that now he cant abuse her (divorced) that this will now go onto me. Background about me is im F(19) and that I have anorexia for which I was hospitalized two years ago for (healthy weight now) and to this day it makes different things very hard for me that would seem totally unrelated i.e. travelling and going on vacation, having normal routines, functioning in basic day to day activities when I have bad body image

My father comments on my food intake to this day and its never to do with eating too little its more thats unhealthy or no thats too much so I havent felt confident to properly explained how things are difficult for me but have clearly said repeatedly that some days I can't do some things and that is unfortunately that and its not because im being stubborn or inconsiderate

But when it comes to these situations I am met with verbal abuse. The most recent example being that we are about to go on holiday for a week with grandparents and cousins which is a privilege may I preface but I asked if I could come one day later than planned due to feeling genuinely ill and already unsteady having just come back from somewhere else. I offered to pay for new flights and transfers my self.

I was met with, you don't care about other people, you won't be able to start university next year because i wont pay for this is you come a day later, if you do this then I dont want to see you for a long time, man up, sometimes you have to do this you don't want to do, you are incredibly selfish, you won't be invited to anything, i bet your friends don't do this. For hours on end with him shouting done the phone and me crying on the other end. Its so exhausting, I have said that this day would make such a difference for me and he said he didn't care whether i was happy or not on the trip but it was for everyone else.

Writing this I feel silly, as I realise I am so privileged to still have my grandparents, go on multiple holidays a year and be able to (hopefully) attend a university but he gets me in such a state of stress, guilt and upset that I can't engage in it anymore. I guess making this post I'm looking for support or validationt that it is verbal abuse but if you had a different opinion, I'm of course open to hearing it"
I am a 14 F and have five siblings 4 brothers and 1 sister. My parents are both doctors and my two oldest brothers are in college to become doctors. My parents have always pressured me to do well in academics and want me to take over their practice when I am older with my two oldest brothers. I have been told I am smart but I really don’t feel like it. My parents are always disappointed in me and this whole situation has given me really bad anxiety. If I disagree with anything my mom says she will hit me then she will tell me it’s all my fault and honestly I feel like it is. It might help to say that it is more my mom then my Dad and most of the time I will get into trouble it’s just her getting mad at me. I have tried to just not show emotion when she hits me but it hurts physically and emotionally. I have thought about suicide multiple times but each time my friends got me not to and I have talked to the hotline as well. The only coping mechanism I have is to hide and do SH. I don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice I would really like it.
"Hello, I (22M), feel stuck and miserable after my dad yelled at me while seated next to me when I was driving him to the station. He later succeeded to have me feed him cake on his birthday ( which was 2 days after he yelled at me) despite my decision to not see him. ( English isn't my first language but I will try my best ) 

For context, I have a missing tooth and I went to consult a dentist. The dentist suggested 2 treatments, which are braces and a dental implant. I was convinced because my previous meetings with other dentists suggested I remove 3 tooths and braces, which i disagreed. However, I don't have money ( I am a full time student ). 

Ever since I was a child, I always turned to my mom if I wanted something. I don't ask my dad because he makes me feel guilty for asking him to buy things. We are a middle class family. I learned to be considerate when asking for anything. When i was 8, I played alot of video games and I used to ask my mom to buy me playstation 2. My mom told me to ask dad. I asked dad and he said he will buy me only if I do well in the exams, which I did. My dad went to the shop alone and bought Playstation 1 cuhz it was cheaper. I told him this is not what I asked for and he replied he didn't know about technology and I should be grateful, and started comparing me with my sisters and the girls in my school for not having a playstation. ( They don't play video games so they don't need one ??) Ever since then I only ask my mom everything, eventhough she will tell me to ask dad. 

The problem is my dad always accuses my mom of spoiling me, yells at her, resents her and gives her the silent treatment. Thus, my mom needs his approval if she were to buy any gadget for me. When I was 12 i did well in the exams again and asked her for a tablet. She told my dad and my dad agreed but was reluctant. My mom bought a tablet for me and I spent 7 hours on it daily. I learned alot from the internet and the games i played. My dad yells at me and mom occasionally bcuhz of my tablet addiction. 

My mom does shopping for me. My dad is reluctant when shopping and would want to go home and leave unpleasant remarks as to why we take so long. My mom does shopping for him as well. It is apparent that my dad doesn't want to participate when it comes to fulfilling my wants as a child. Even if he does it he will do it reluctantly, or asks me to do well in school, only for him to spend minimally as possible. My dad doesn't talk it through with me either. I understand its his money and he can do whatever he wants with his money but why say yes and do it reluctantly later? He isn't genuine and I feel like I'm eating his money away for my own pursuit. Why isn't he happy to see me happy? My mom was happy, why can't he? He yells at me whenever i spend too much time on the tablet, or if I misbehave, and it took a toll on my mental health. I started to stay silent more.

My mom passed away. Her passing crushed the whole family. As I was growing up watching my dad yell at her when its about me, I started resenting him. He also abused her verbally but that's a different story. I resented him alot after my mom's passing. I couldn't stay with him and i pleaded to stay in my granny's house. They agreed. I did well in school now i don't see my dad anymore. But my dad does the groceries and will visit my granny's house. He still has contact with me. 

Fast forward to 22, I didn't learn my lesson. I don't have mom so I asked my dad to fund the treatment. He suggested to go to a family friend dentist but it was far and i insisted to see this one. He reluctantly agreed. My father is retired. He took a 5 hour public transport to my place and i brought him to the dentist. The dentist explained to him the pricing. It was about RM13k for both treatments. I was afraid my dad couldn't afford it. My dad said to not worry and do one treatment first before moving to the second. However, we have to meet the specialist dentist to finalize the price before having the treatment. My dad said i wasted his day for bringing him to a general dentist. I wasn't aware about the procedures. I was ignorant. But why can't my dad see that I'm trying? He always point my flaws but never praise me for trying. 

I felt disgusted with myself. I realised at that moment that my dad doesn't want to fund me anymore. I am like a burden to him when i ask him for anything, and my childhood is proof. I thought of applying to a part time job then, since I am burdening him. He disagreed, saying that it will be hard to follow up classes and the job. I agree with him but why he couldn't see that I want try? 

Later in the car he told me to not on the AC immediately as it can crack the hot windows. I lowered the windows and he still insists to not on the AC? The AC was hot since the weather was hot. How will it crack the windows? I got so angry I bursted at him. No matter what i do its always not good enough. 

Me: U always find fault in whatever I do and I feel invalidated by my own father. The flaw is always the first thing u see and say. I don't want to listen to ur ""opinion"" on whatever i do anymore. 

He yelled at me 

Dad: Then whats the point of me being a father if I can't have an ""opinion"" in what I do. ""Opinion"" is something not right or wrong. You don't listen to it but I can tell my opinion. I only asked u to lower the windows. Instead of saying, ""ok I'll do it, Dad"", u talk unnecessarily. What for u ask me to come to the dentist if u don't want my ""opinion"". Look at the car. It's so dirty. U don't even have time to clean the car. 

Me : U can have a ""opinion"" but everytime u give one its invalidating. Its very discouraging to hear and it hurts me alot. I'm telling u it hurts me but why do u keep doing it? I don't want to listen to ur ""opinion"". Life has been hard for me I'm struggling here with uni and my feelings. I am human I have feelings. But the car is more important. I am like a robot to u to wash the car and go to school while pushing aside my emotional needs. 

Dad : Bloody, I bought the car with my blood and sweat. Its my money, ofc I have an opinion on this car. U don't talk about feelings when U disrespect me. U called me ""idiot"" for being computer illiterate ( he didn't know how to log out my account in the family pc, instead he deleted all my chats permanently, but he uses WhatsApp for 6 years already now ) . U called me ""f**ker"" too ( I wanted to clean my room the day after tmr as I was tired but he didn't respect it instead he forced me out embarrassed me infront of my sis and took away the mattress. I couldn't sleep I felt violated and I turned violent and started cleaning the room despite feeling tired doing what he wants not what I want. Living my life for his like I don't matter. I hurt my limbs but i still cleaned the room with all the pain). 

He yelled so loud when saying that I was so scared he would hit me as I was driving the car. I thought i would die there and then. 

Me : U are giving me reasons to disrespect u. U think I like being like this. Saying nasty things. U brought this to urself. U only care about urself and invalidate me. So how can i still respect u? 

We argued more and I left him to the station. I told him I'm not coming back home!

His birthday was 2 days after our fight. He told my aunt and uncle (his brother) that i didn't come back home for his birthday dinner. His brother called me and urged me to come back home as my aunt ""cooked"" lunch for me and it will go to waste. My aunt gave me and ultimanium that If I don't go back she won't cook for me again. I went back home reluctantly. I got to know my dad told them i ""give him a hard time"". They told me to apologise and wish him birthday or they won't talk to me/will beat me. 

During the dinner, I didn't wish him at first. They got upset and gave me the stares to wish and apologise during cake feeding ceremony. I did, dishonestly. My dad was ""happy"".

 I felt disgusted of him. I lost respect for him. I didn't want to see him. He gets away with everything. I don't blame him entirely. His environment is filled with enablers to boost his ego. He looks like a narcissist to me. I wanted to go back to uni so badly after the party. I didn't look back at him. 

After the whole incident, I decided that I don't want the dental treatment. He is right. I am leeching off from him. Its his money, he can do whatever he wants with it. But I don't understand why he agrees to spend for me when he is reluctant? Why can't he say no? I feel disgusted living from his money. I hate myself. I am applying for part time jobs now. 

I learnt that he is not happy seeing me happy the hard way. He is in victimhood. He won't take accountability nor address his part. I had to apologise to him for feeling invalidated and for having my own feelings and not in favour to his feelings. I have to play the ""bigger person"" altho he is 40 years older than me. His whole environment thinks that way too. All because he has money and he funded my life. I feel so disgusted on how u can get excused because u have money even in father-son relationship. I don't want to build any relationship with money as a basis. I want genuine feelings of connection and respect. I have rights to be respected as a human being. That is taken away by my own family.

"14F , 

I live in an emotionally/mentally and physically abusive home. (My mother mostly) I’d consider her neglectful in teaching me a lot of things she should have. Or helping and supporting me with my Sexual assaults and trauma

I wouldn’t go as far as to say she’s sexually abusive but she’s given me such a weird view of it. I remember showing her RHERE probably because I just started puberty and was excited about getting older , (she barely told me about puberty I just literally had to figure it out myself. Along with most other things ) I remember her poking me there for some reason..(maybe I was concerned about there or something?) and she said “one touch and your already wet” and she laughed, I don’t remember if that’s exactly what she said because ir was. A while ago

 ber how I reacted and I don’t feel this was SA but as I said she was very weird and too open. She’s talked about her sexual experiences and generally been kind of weird. I remember at 12 It felt so normalised I said something very personal (around that topic) about someone special to me (bf) to her because I thought it was normal. She compared what I said to her ex bf and weird stuff. I won’t get into it because I feel disgusted at myself for saying that so randomly , literally just copying her because I felt it was okay got to the point I’d randomly start talking about sexual things and sex.

She never taught me hygiene or how to do things , so puberty and things around that was difficult, rather mood swings or stuff or just well everything. Periods especially as all she told me was how to put a pad on and take paracetamol. 

She even has sex when I’m in the house . Like she doesn’t have a care in the world that I’m literally a few doors over. I remember doing really weird things.

She’s joked about how my private places looked weird and laughed about it. She’s bodyshamed me and humiliated me

She never dealt or took my sexual assault and abuse throughout my younger years seriously. She used it because she just didn’t like those peoples families . 

She never really monitored what I watched or taught me anything at all, I grew up hypersexual due to my trauma and general situation around the internet 

She knows about my ME TIME. And has even mentioned it during an argument . She’s even touched my things and randomly cleans my room and moves everything into places I don’t know and will call me disgusting for being 

She didn’t care , she knows i SH, she slapped me in the face when she first found out then never cared ever again, she’s read my vent journal and brang it up but doesn’t care enough to do anything . Her main concern is my scars showing in summer.  And she’d randomly touch them or lift my shorts to see . 

She doesn’t even give me an inch of privacy and doesn’t knock when she enters.  She’s removed every lock I had , whilst every room in our house even the kitchen has a lock on it and I don’t even have a simple one. When I did she still peeked in through the window at the top of my door.

She downplays what I went through then will randomly cry or rant about her relationship to me .

I remember sucking my thumb when I was  younger because idk comfort? And she looked at me weirdly and I think she was implying I was thinking about something sexual.   And told me to stop (even though I wasn’t)

She hits me when she’s mad and says very mean things to me .

I’m tired of this, my behaviour is so out of control and I never even knew until now. I’m so unstable and feel so much guilt . I feel so disgusting

And I still can’t hate her.  
I can’t wait to leave 

Fuck you mom, even though I can’t help but love you I really want to hate you.

One of the many things that makes me fight or put me in situations with my parents is when my dad calls for me and i can't even ask why. He just expects me to obey without hearing the reason. It's always been something that annoy me and an hour ago it happened again but this time i (26) didn't budge and my dad (64) came up to me and hit me while saying that when he calls for me i should just obey without question. I genuinely don't know if I'm just a stubborn dumbass or I'm right.
"when i (21y/o) was a teen i lived with both my parents and both were abusive, my dad was much more explosive than my mum (53y/o) and it was so difficult to cope that i became cold, angry and antisocial with my parents. when i look back at my teenage actions and behaviours, a lot of them were shitty. i used to criticise my mum a lot for things that were invalid like the music she used to listen to or how she dressed and i think some of it was learnt behaviour or resentment as she used to ridicule me as a child. 

i still struggle with reacting in the best and healthiest way but i have come a long way since then, my actions/behaviours have improved and im a different person to my teenage self now. she has always had abusive behaviours but its been getting much worse these past several months. 

i don’t think she even realises that this is a likely reason for why she behaves so poorly towards me. "
"kinda just a rant.


this is only the tip of the iceberg to what my father did to me, but as i get older i see more of how fucked up this is. naming a kid jezebel. the amount of times i’ve had people look disgusted upon hearing it, call me a slut as a 12 year old. i’ve had people laugh in my face when they heard. his excuse was he heard a “prophecy” that i would “reclaim the name jezebel” but like seriously?? you didn’t think that through?? not only am i not a slut, i’m fucking ace. 
if you’re reading this gabe, fuck you."
"REALLY LONG ASS POST.


i don't remember much about my childhood. for some reason, my brain did the opposite of a defence mechanism, and ""deleted"" most of my happy memories. they only come to my mind when others tell me about it or similiar experiences. i remember most of the bad stuff tho.

my mother has always been aggressive to me (i'm 15 f) and my sister (18f). she hit us often. i remember a couple of times her grabbing us by the hair and dragging us around. my sister was definitely more in trouble than i was, since she didn't study. (this was happening in elementary school) she hit us if we made a mess (mess could also mean not making the bed right, leaving toys around, accidentally breaking something exc.)

she hit me when i talked about things i wasn't supposed to. 

when i was 7yo i talked at the dinner table with my uncle about my grandma not knowing that they had an argument. later i asked my mum if she could come with me to the bathroom, and when we got there she hit me. quite often during functions she would take me to another room to scold me/hit me.
""hitting"" usually meant slapping in these superficial situations. 
that one time who stuck with me the longest was when in third grade i didn't finish my maths' homework and the next day when my mother found out that it wasn't done (the teacher didn't even see it) she grabbed me by the ear, dragged me to my room where she slapped me, bit me, pinched me, pushed me to the bed where she continued to beat me up for a few minutes. i don't remember her leaving any bruises or if she said anything at all. she then locked me in my room for the whole afternoon; she used to do that a lot. 
she would also scream at us and call us names (stupid and stuff like that). sometimes she threatened us to kill us and other times she threw stuff at us. i remember her hitting me in the neck/head with a wooden spatula while i was in a fetal position. she mostly stopped hitting us at about 10yo. (btw nor me or my sister ever threw any tantrums nor asked for things. we were really polite, and never talked back). 

 i also remember her forgetting me at school, birthday parties or other activities. sometimes she'd pick me up two or three hours late. she still does that. she used to put a ton of academic pressure on me. if i got an A- (so even if i made one mistake) she'd tell me that i should study more and that i'm lazy exc. also, she is really contradictory. sometimes she'd say that the most important thing was me to get perfect grades, sometimes that it was to clean around the house, sometimes she'd say that i didn't need to clean around the house and that i just needed to have a clean bedroom. once i mentioned this to her, and she said that i had to be perfect in everything. 

all this made me develop sh and suicidal tendencies. i also attempted multiple times. (this happened from 2020 to 2023) over the time she became less strict, but the damage was done and i was obsessed with perfection. she found out about sh in 2020-2021 (srry i can't remember) and never mentioned it to me. 

In 2020 she made me cut contacts with my bestfriend bc she wasn't popular. she made me hang out with the popular kids in elementary and middle school but they hated me and spread rumors. in 2022 i was tired of the daily suicidal thoughts and my mother was well aware of them. i distinctly remember that after an argument about an unrelated stuff, while i was going to my room she said ""yeah right, go cut yourself"" in a sarcastic manner.

she NEVER apologised for ANYTHING at all, she'd buy us clothes instead.

anyways, in 2022 i begged my mother for a therapist. she brushed me off. in August i called cps. they didn't do much, but now my mother was forced to bring me to a therapist. after about a year, i was diagnosed with severe depression and ocd. when the therapist suggested antidepressants, my mother refused and didn't take me there anymore. so i don't have a certificate for ocd nor depression, but i know i have it. my parents and i had a huge argument when i called cps, and i still kind of regret it and feel guilty about it, but i'd probably been dead for a while now if i didn't call them. to this day i hate my mother. she doesn't tolerate mistakes. from September to june she lived in another city for work reasons and only came in weekends. my sister isn't any better tho. they're the same. my sister sometimes hits me, and she said that i'm ruining her life. my sister and my parents are aware of the diagnosis, but they don't believe in it nor acknowledge it.

most of my friends are sorry for me, but at the same time my generation (me included) is really weak and always talks about trauma. i also know some people who have really strict parents, like taking phones and stuff. my parents always let me hang out at any time and have very few rules. 

btw, i'm slowly getting better so i don't need any advice and even if i'm the one exaggerating i plan to go nc with her. but my mother never asks me if i'm alright, she tells me to stop crying if i'm crying, and sometimes she doesn't even notice if i'm crying beside her.

still, i know other kids who had it wayy worse than me. so i feel a little bad."
"..This is my first time writing on of these so I'm F14 I just turned 14 I have 3 other siblings F2,F5,M10 so my dad comes over my house monthly or weekly sometimes my mom was 19 and my dad was 29 when she got pregnant with me my mom was on a full ride to become a doctor until my dad came in her life and messed everything up my mom always grew up poor her mom boyfriend would r@pe her every night to the point she'll have to keep a knife under her pillow but let's go back to tonight every time my dad comes over they scream and fight mostly him she's just defending herself but everytimes that happens I send my 2 year old sister to go walk in and everything will calm down my dad calm over a little later today and my little sister was sleep I think I might delete this but my dad always touches me while I'm sleep so I like to close my door with my little sister on there bed and me on my bed and it makes me so uncomfortable but back to tonight I spent a extra time on my phone doing what normal teenage girls do texting and scrolling tiktok so I heard something but it sounds like it was getting close to my room but it wasn't so I turned my ac off and all he keep emotionally degrading her ""You're broken, your mom or dad probably did that to your useless dumbass or maybe it was your stepdad fucking that stupid ass pussy of yours"" I can't remember all of it but it was going on and on and he was trying to guilt trip her and my dad got out of jail for attempted murder but he only got caught because he had a friend with him but he was saying stuff like "" I'll slap yo bitch ass to sleep stop disburing my harmony and listen"" and "" you're so controlling you're not control me like you control those stupid ass kids of yours"" my mom feels like if she leaves him she'll never be loved agained and she soul tied to him HE BASICALLY FORCED MY MOM IN A CAR AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING this is the first time I ever spoke about this.."
"i have never thought of my parents as abusive before. they argue with me and my sister quite often and love to pull the “we’re your parents, we have the right” card a lot whenever they do something we don’t like, but until last night i would have never considered the word abusive. last night, my sister let her phone die while she was out with her friends, something they have been very clear about not wanting to happen. we have life360, meaning everyone can see everyone else’s phone battery percentages at all times. my mom was upset, and called my sister after she had charged her phone. she raised her voice a little bit and sorta berated her in front of her friends. she was in tears the whole drive home, and she later said that her friends spent the drive talking to her “like she had abusive parents”. when she got home, my dad asked what was wrong, and she said she would talk in the morning, but my dad kept insisting, so my sister snapped and started yelling. she went into her room and was bawling. my dad was trying to talk to her. she was having a panic attack, which she told my dad at the time. my mom then came in and started yelling at her for her “behavior”, and spent upwards of fifteen minutes standing in front of my sister and demanding she hand over the phone. my sister refused. she wanted to call our aunt and go over to her house for the night, but our aunt was asleep. my mom kept asking and she kept refusing. this escalated to my mom following her around the house when my sister tried to get away, threatening to call the cops if she didn’t hand the phone over, and eventually, splashing a glass of water on my sister’s face out of anger. she claimed it was “to calm her down” and never apologized, even saying she would gladly do it again. she accused my sister of drinking (she is 16) and spent a fairly long time yelling at her about how disappointed she was. she heard the comment about her friends thinking she was abusive, and responded by saying that she should “find a more loving family” if they were that bad. 

like i said before, i have never considered my parents abusive, but i am starting to rethink that. "
"Hi, im 18F living with 49 years old father, 41 years old mother and two younger sisters . I can't complain about my mum, she's absolutely lovely and I'd kill for her. My dad on the other hand, holy shit-

Here's a list of things he did, didn't get to write all of it, but it's the things that I still remember:

- refuses to give me a key for the apartment 

- always yells at me to get out of the shower, even if my hair is covered in shampoo, and if i don't, he'll switch off the lights and shut down the water completely

- wakes me up in the middle of the night to go clean up my cat's litter because he gets up to pee during the night and he's the only one that is affected by it

- destroys my stuff (food related) I made a protein smoothie, drank some and left some for my sister, he went to the kitchen and let it flow down the drain to the very last drop. Also happened once with coffee, he poured it down the drain in the sink after i just finished making it, because I replied with ""you too"" at his awful comment that he made about me

- takes my stuff away that I paid for, so it's basically stealing. Took away my laptop charger, my Amazon Alexa Echodot, the charger for it, my phone charger. I had to go to look for it individually around the house in order to find my own stuff again. The Amazon Alexa I still haven't gotten back, and he refuses to give me it back, he even threatened me that he'd destroy it. 

- Calls me names multiple times a day, slurs, and tells me to go fuck myself. Talks shit about me with others. Brings me down emotionally all the time. (I ignore all of this, because I'm not at that low of a level and position)

- Pushes me out of the way every time he gets. I almost got my fingers stuck in the Silverware drawer because he pushed me into it while I was trying to get a fork out. Pushes me out of his room forcefully whenever i try to talk to him

- Doesn't let me have the stuff that I bought with my own money in my own room. I bought a new printer because the old one (he bought it) broke. It could be fixable, but I can't do it and I doubt he'll do it for me, so I decided to buy a new one, since I need it for school and other stuff. Threatened me not to move the old printer from there, and not to dare put the new one there.

- Hits me occasionally. I threatened to call the cops on him, and he got incredibly mad and slapped me on my face and proceeded to call me names and curse at me for ""don't you dare scare me off"", even though he scares us off all the time and threatens us to do the stuff that he wants every time. 

- Hits my family too. He once got into a heated argument with my mom, proceeded to hit her so hard her entire arms were fully covered in big blue bruises. We took pictures of it, but sadly, the pictures got deleted as we were forced to factory reset the phone, as she had forgotten the password to it

- Takes aways my mom's stuff as well, her own stuff that she bought, it's her phone most of the times, so she was forced to buy another phone that would be kept secret from him, in case he would take it away from her. He used to take my own phone away as well, my mom bought it for me, so it's not even his (over the stupidest things ever, he used to take it away ""as a joke"" and I'd have to kiss his ass to get it back, say please like 15 times and kiss him on the cheek = wtf?)

- he forcefully pushed me out of the way when taking something out of the fridge, he tried closing it while my arm was still inside the fridge and so crushing my arm, then yelled at me to get out of the kitchen while I was still making food for myself because I was hungry after work

- considers I always owe him something at all times, and if I couldn't fulfill his demands right then and there, he would take my phone away, and proceed to yell at me angrily, even if I would be busy doing something else

- destroys stuff around the house when something doesn't go his way. He took some bar and hit the light on the ceiling with it, and it proceeded to break and crumble into glass shards everywhere (all of this because we wouldn't turn off the light when he wanted to, my mom wanted to have the light on too). He almost destroyed the clothing drying rack because it was in his way. Overall very destructive and with serious anger issues

- always listens to facebook reels or youtube, or the TV on basically full volume, and gets mad whenever someone tells him to turn it down a little, this is especially true in the late evening, when I try to sleep, or when my mom is trying to get my little sister to fall asleep. Also disregards any remark about him turning it down

- calls my mom fat all the time, brings her down emotionally, calls her names, gets incredibly angry when she doesn't pick up the phone after the first time he called

- he always has to be begged to do something, even to come eat, my mom has to beg him and kiss him and stuff like that, like wtf, someone makes you food and you even want to be begged to come eat it?? Always takes very long to do something that we asked but expects us to complete his demands immediately 

Note that most of this has happened ever since I stopped talking to him after I expressed my opinion on everything I thought about him and how unfair he is treating us (about 3-4 months now).

I live in Berlin, Germany. Any advice would be pretty helpful. I'm pretty stuck here, I don't have nearly enough money to move out. I can move out in about a year, when I move in with my boyfriend in Belgium, after I graduate high school. But I don't think I can handle this treatment for another year, it's draining me emotionally and physically, and I've always been too scared to call the police because I'm afraid things may take a turn to even worse. 

My mum can't really do much about this either, I've told her multiple times to just get a divorce, but she keeps saying it's not that easy and she's just scared to raise 3 kids on her own (well more like two because I'm pretty much independent now). She hates him just as much, but still takes his side sometimes, like today when I asked her if i could have the money the state gives me (500€ a month) to find a room to stay in, she said that if she was me, she would let her guard down and go apologize (???)

Thank you for your comments!

"im a 21 year old male. i live mostly by myself and live off of ssi disability. i have autism and adhd, and i wanted to post my story.

both of my parents were abusive in different ways. my father was an extreme alchoholic while my mother is... an extremely stressed out person. i have a brother too but he isnt abusive just... he is just my brother. ever since i was young i have seen the sides of my parents that no one else wants to see. my dad would repeatedly get a job, then quit it for various reasons. then drink himself pissed and talk to me and my brother about various things. my mom on the other hand, would get extremely angry at anything she explicitly sees as, being bad. failing a test, lying, or getting into trouble. she would always get extremely pissed off. to the point sometimes hitting me and my brother. pardon me if i dont go into detail it... i dont like thinking about back then. we were always poor. either due to my mother, or to my father i dont know.

however, my father is dead. he has been dead for almost a year now. mostly due to the divorce, and my mother sending child support after him, even though me and ty were basically 18 at that point. but... well, my brother started smoking weed. then mom found out and got extremely mad, losing trust in both of us. then she got really strict, making me get up at 6, forcing me to run a mile every day, trying to get me into the military. she... the last week, i forgot to do one chore, she punished me, and i was delirious, i knocked over some of her stuff, and she lost her mind and started locking me out of the house.

grandma then asked for me to live over at her house, which i accepted and... well, thats a different story.

i signed up for ssi, and mom was the one to accept the responsibility, even though i was strongarmed into choosing her. now, living in my own apartment, im getting punished for things again. things like forgetting to send a reciept. i dont know how much longer i can take this..."
"I (22 F) come from a conservative mexican family. I would describe most of them as judgamental, hypocritical and nosy to some degree, but my mom takes the crown. Ever since I can remember (and the stories I have heard from other family members), she has had anger issues, and likes to lie, manipulate and cause harm if she doesn't get her way. She's a drama queen who never apologizes or even recognizes her wrong doings.

The worst part is that I seem to be the only one who sees that and won't take her shit, so therefore I'm the problem. My dad and sibling enable her and won't do shit to defend me or even themselves when she goes on a rampage. Some examples of what she has done during her little outbursts (besides the obvious yelling of obscenities): threw and broke a set of china and a lamp, ripped apart a cupboard door, almost smashed my phone and the incident that led me to seek solace here, but before we get to that, have some context around her behaviour:

She has looked through my belongings, read my diaries and conversations a couple of times, taken away all my devices despite my age and me not having even raised my voice, given me the silent treatment, threatened to call the police on my friends for harassing me because she didn't want me to hang out with them, threatened to cut me off and kick me out, threatened to ask the rest of the family to not support me financially anymore (I heavily rely on them because my parents won't give me more than a few bucks for public transport), called me lazy, a whore and all the variations of idiot, made backhanded compliments and passive-aggresive remarks... To sum it up, she's a bitch and a control freak. She also has to have my location at all times or else she will freak out (once I was out and about without my location on and she called me six times, sent ominous texts to worry me, and when I picked up my dad told me she was having a heart attack and she won't calm down until she sees my location), and if I go out with friends I have to share their full names and phone numbers at the very least. I know it's a safety measure but I can't stand it.

Anyways, to the incident in question. I've always wanted to be in a rock band, to perform and make music, but my mom and dad have never been fond of the idea. Mostly because they don't like the scene, the environment, the ""weird"" people, and the affiliation to drugs musicians have (which I can understand). I am in a band now, and while they don't like it they sorta support me... Or that was until what happened some days ago. The band had the oh-so-wonderful idea of accepting an sponsorship/collab with a guy who sells pot, and my mom caught wind of it. To say that all hell broke loose would be an understatement. My parents said that while they trusted I don't smoke anything or even drink, they don't trust the bad people I am surrounding myself with, and began yelling about how I'm not safe there, that I'm going to get myself killed, that If cops ever came around one of our shows I was going to end up in jail and blemish my record even I didn't do anything, that a cartel would send hitmen to kill everyone thanks to that one guy selling pot, that I'm going to get kidnapped, that I was stupid, naive and careless for trusting my bandmates and the people around us, and a myriad of other messed up stuff. In all honestly, while I understand where they're coming from, I think most of that shit is borderline ridiculous and very extreme.

My mom told me she would have failed as a mother if she let me hang around places like that (meaning the seedy bars and venues in which we host our shows) and that she was going to save me before it was too late, and demanded I quit the band in that instant. I refused. The argument and her reactions kept escalating until she took my guitar from my room and put it in her bathroom. I laughed at her feeble attempt of keeping it away from me and tried to take it, but she quickly got right behind me. She tried to rip it away from me and a physical fight ensued. She said she would destroy it if I didn't quit and did as she said, that I know she's capable of such, and threatened to throw it out the window and run it over with the car. She kicked the guitar a couple of times and tried to rip away the tuning keys. Mind you, my dad was right in front of us just looking at us with a lost stare, didn't do shit besides telling my mom to calm down. At this point, I know I am alone in this. I let go of the guitar and told her to do whatever she wants and locked myself in my room. Some minutes later, I hear her locking the guitar up in the car. It's been days and I'm afraid of the damage the heat and my mom may have done to the guitar. My mom no longer leaves her keys on the table besides the entrance.

This is something I need to solve ASAP as I have an event with the band in some days, but I don't know what to do. I feel like everyone is acting against me, even my own sibling is telling me I should let her win or she'll make my life miserable. I feel like I was backed into a corner. I can't go to the rest of my family for support because they are just as messed up in the head as her and will try to tell me she's right and convince me that I am better off being ""normal, behaving and acting like a lady"". They want to ""fix me"". I think it's all bullshit. I don't know what to do or say that will make my mom change her mind. Everything was fine until that stupid collab. I know I should have put my foot down and not let that happen, but I didn't want to come across as a goody-two-shoes. Anyways, I can't change the past... But I don't want to leave the band.

Any advice? Take into account I'm a college student living with my parents with a whopping 50 bucks allowance per month, and that if I runaway or move away right now I will most likely recieve horrible backlash from my family.

What the fuck can I do or say or compromise to make her change her mind and see how ridiculous she sounds?"
"This happened years ago, but I’m only just now realizing how fucked up it is. 
So about 8 years ago, my mother who neglected me for years showed up and stared being a part of my life again, only to announce that she had cheated on my dad was pregnant but didn’t know who the father was. At the time, (I was 10 btw) I didn’t understand and was just happy to have a sister. However, when my younger sister was born, I discovered something terrifying. The first thing my mom pointed out to me when I met my half sister was that we have the same name. We don’t have the exact same name, but in the original language the names are derived from, they have the same meaning. My mother thought this would be a way for us to bond. However, I realize now how terrible that is. My mom abandoned me when I was 5, and didn’t contact me for almost 6 years, missing a large majority of my childhood. In a way, I felt like she did this because she saw my half sister as a replacement or a do over child for me. It still hurts now because she devotes all her time into being a good mother for her and gets to watch her grow up, meanwhile my mom hasn’t been here for me at all since. She didn’t come for my birthday, left early at my graduation, and won’t bother to see me before I leave for college but will constantly post her other daughter online often and spend every day with her. On top of that, my half sister is a brat because my mom lets her get away with everything and I have to deal with her ex-husband, my dad who manipulates and abuses me verbally because he thinks that just because he stayed and my mom didn’t, that makes him a better parent than her. Maybe it’s just jealousy, but sometimes I just feel straight rage and I wanna scream. 

So there’s my story time lol

"He can be extremely nasty one day and very nice another. When he's mad at me he says really hurtful things, even accused me of being an animal abuser (I've never abused animals) and said I'm the most selfish person he's ever met. As a kid he told me things children should never ever hear from anyone. He told me people like me get bullied when I felt anxious after encountering a middle school bully. He's threatened to beat me up multiple times and he was a martial arts champion. He even gets verbally aggressive with my cats over small things. However, he pays for most of my things and says he wants to repair our relationship. I don't have much respect for him, but when he's nice I feel guilty about it. Also my family gives me crap for assuming the worst from him. How do you guys handle thing sort of relationship?"
"I (16F) dont know if my parents are abusive, and i was hoping the ppl here could help me find a definitive answer. 

  
My dad used to scream at me and my brothers when we did something ""wrong"". This generally meant that if we were annoying him, he would start shouting at us, even though we were very young. One time that i remember because of what he did afterwards i think i was about 8, making my brothers 5 and 9. I was being sulky and in response to him saying i needed to do something (stop fighting with my older brother, i think?) and i said ""okay"" in a disrespectful tone and he, without warning, shouted ""NO IT IS **NOT** OKAY"". I think this wouldn't be too bad, but when i was 14 i lived alone with him for some months, and when he would laugh or raise his voice (as in speak slightly louder than before) when he was on work calls, despite him being downstairs and me being upstairs in my room, my heartrate would rise noticeably and roughly once a week i would pause what i was listening to to listen to him to make sure he wasnt angry so i knew i was safe. I still get scared sometimes when he clears his voice bc its a similar sound. The reason i remember ""it is not okay"" is because while he was screaming at me he threw a plastic tub filled with wall plugs, boxes of screws, etc. at me, breaking it and making the contents spill out. while he didnt hit me, when it broke part of the plastic scratched my leg. I don't recall any other times when he (tried to) hurt me, but i think he might've broken a cup in our living room when he was angry (my memory's fuzzy), and my older brother said that he used to hit us, specifically our younger brother, but i dont know if thats true, i dont remember any of it (if i was too young to remember being hit, when i can remember as far back as my 4th birthday, my brother who is 3yrs younger wouldve been incredibly young). The reason im not sure if this is abuse is that i think there needs to be a pattern, and i only remember him trying to hurt me once. Since i was 14 he has improved a lot, and he hasnt shouted at any of us since and is just a regular shitty father now.

For my entire life my mum has made me feel like theres something wrong with me and nitpicked my behaviour, while also being quite neglectful, she has threatened and once has stopped buying food for me and my brothers (she doesnt let us eat her food, we were never taught how to cook, my older brother has EDS so might not be able to walk to the nearest supermarket and back, i am agoraphobic to the extent that i cant use public transport without being told a week in advance, and my little brother was 12 at this point, and i wouldnt trust him to not just buy sweets for himself), although this lasted for less than a week, she stopped doing her job as a parent who quit her job to take care of us bc we were backtalking to her. She also makes very odd comments abt my body and has since i started puberty (as an 11 year old), talking abt the pajamas i wear (she thought the shorts were indecent to wear at the dinner table.... when ur sitting down.... my older brother regularly wears underwear at the table but she doesnt complain about that and humiliate him in front of the rest of us), my figure and my weight loss in a way that if a boy did i would think he was trying to flirt and failing BADLY. She has also called me ""attractive"" when i was 14-15, and i have asked her to stop commenting on my body multiple times bc its fucking weird, but eventually i stopped asking since i know it wont stop her. I asked one of my friends if she thought it was sexual harassment and she did, but take the words of a 13-14 yr old girl with a grain of salt.  
  
I've left out some details of their behaviour bc its 11pm where i am, im tired and i dont think they amount to abuse any more than what ive already described. So yeah, i think a lot of this is grey area stuff, but id really appreciate some input from this subreddit "

"33f living with 68m abusive father. He has been physically, emotionally, verbally, and psychologically abusive my entire life.

I’m at a point where I don’t know what to do any more. I just had a son 6 months ago and I feel desperate because while I was pregnant I got fired from my job (already sought litigation and got some money from it) but I am now* working part time again, need the money to save to cover expenses like food and bills since my partner isn’t working because we have no help with childcare*. Partner’s from out of state and has no family here and I’m from where we’re living but I have no family because they consist of abusive people and have hated me since I spoke up about my cousin inflicting sexual trauma on me when I was a child.

Because we are not financially stable, we’re living in the house I co own with my dad and he has always tried to say he’d help me and be there for me and do anything he can. And I stupidly kept believing it because he’s literally the only family I have and I would have no one and so the hope that he would change went over the logic of reconciling he won’t. And I feel like I’m losing my mind.

Two weeks ago my dad was shaming* me for creating boundaries around being able to touch or pick up my son. My dad is constantly out around so many different people from where he works and I only asked that he wash his hands before touching my son and he says this thing of ‘get over it’ or ‘don’t worry about it’ and when I tell him he’s my son and I have a right to ask that people not touch him after touching surfaces that random strangers touch all day, and that my dads complaints of having diarrhea or a stomach bug don’t make me feel any better about him not washing his hands, he tells me I have too many boundaries and I don’t need them. I get frustrated and say the conversation is annoying and I’d like for him to just leave me alone. He responded by threatening to slap me because I’m a ‘disrespectful little bitch’ and ‘he’s my father’ and ‘I don’t respect him’ and he goes and does it. 

He attacks me and hits me and then I’m trying to push him away and keep him away from me while also trying to think about how to keep my son safe and I’m screaming for my husband while he’s inside making a bottle and can’t hear me. Then my dad hits me in my face and grabs my shirt and rips it as he lifts it up and exposes my breasts and stares at them. I’m humiliated and he still isn’t letting me go and I wind up screaming for help and essentially going feral trying to bite his neck because I’m so afraid and feeling unsafe. I called the police and because he’s a retired* officer himself, the cop just said ‘okay well you should move* out’ yeah no fucking shit I should move* out, if I had a place to go or any fucking money to do it I would be gone. I would have been gone. But I’m stuck here and can’t fucking leave and my family all knows how he is and just tells me to call the police but they don’t help.

I am at my wits end and* I am in a state of fight because I am so tired of being afraid that he is going to attack me again and hurt me or rape me or kill me in front of my son. And my husband wouldn’t even know until it happens and might find me. We have no where to go and no one to help and I’m supposed to be starting school again so I can get my degree to be able to move my career across state so that I can finally go no contact.

I feel so fucking alone and he’s done shit like this to me my whole life and I truly don’t know what to do because now it’s extending to my family and it feels like it’s my fault because he’s my dad. He keeps saying he doesn’t wanna fight and he loves me but then he threatens me and my husband and just walks into our home without an invitation and then responds by telling me I need to ‘get over it.’

I know most of you will say get a restraining order (in the process of doing so) call police (done that already, several times, and filed police reports) or move (no money and can’t uproot my career because it would set us back financially even more).

Im more so just venting about all this because I have no one to talk about it besides my partner and he’s exhausted from dealing with my dad too so it’s not like I can expect him to be there for me 100% when he’s feeling shitty too. 

I don’t want my son to be subjected to this and seeing his mom feel and look crazy because I’m responding to my abuse with an intense reaction. I literally have no patience left, no grey rocking method left in me, no accessing my inner Cilian Murphy because I am so fucking tired of being gaslit and dismissed and shamed and told because I’m someone’s daughter I deserve to be small and not have a voice and shouldn’t speak up because only bad people have boundaries or defend themselves. I feel like I’m fucking going crazy and I’m so tired of feeling unsafe. And I’m so angry to the point where I’m yelling at my father to just leave me alone and go fucking die because he’s a useless abusive piece of shit. But because I can’t keep it together because I’m so mad and reactive from him hurting me my entire life that I just look like the crazy one. 

I don’t know what to do. I just wish I had someone. I wish I had a friend I wish I had a place to go to and feel safe and I wish I wasn’t born into a family that uses me as a fucking scape goat just because I’m the cycle breaker and I let people know of the generational abuse in our family. I’ve blamed myself for their treatment of me so long because I started to believe that I must* be a terrible person if my family treats me this way, right? I must* be a piece of shit for my father to rip my shirt and stare at my breasts and slap me and for my aunt to call me a 9 year old promiscuous slut because her son raped me, right? If I wasn’t a piece of shit then why would they treat me this way? 

And now I’ve gone to being angry and thinking you know what I don’t deserve this so I’m just gonna traumatize him right back. But honestly aside from fucking yelling and crying all the time I feel like he’s gonna wind up killing me or vice versa. I don’t know what to fucking do. The loneliness makes me want to kill myself because it feels like I’ll never escape."
"I’m 23F and have been out of my parents house for about 5 years now (since going to college and moving away as soon as I graduated)

Basically, my dad was very verbally abusive growing up (screamed and berated me constantly) and my mom only enabled his behavior and never stood up for me (would use the classic “I’m telling your father” threat). My dad rarely talks to me now so I don’t have much of an issue with him; I think he understands I don’t want to be close with him.

My parents and I never once talked about my awful experiences growing up and I have a very estranged relationship with them. I live about 5 hrs away in another state now with my partner. The issue I’m facing now is particularly with my mother…

She texts me every single day and freaks out worrying when I don’t respond. She’ll call me on the phone and go on about mundane things. Its just becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with this act of talking all friendly with her knowing I can’t forgive how she treated me growing up. She never once apologized. I don’t even know how or where to begin to address it.

And I feel terrible sometimes for feeling this way because she’s so friendly on the phone sometimes. Just chatting away about whatever. It just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth because I know how she truly was to me growing up. These conflicting feelings are really whats affecting me the most.

I guess what I want to ask is, how can I set further boundaries with her? I’m not comfortable texting her every day, especially knowing she will panic when I don’t respond. I can’t even understand why she acts like that because we have not been close since I was a young child. Could it possibly be that she’s afraid or expecting me to fully shut her out? I really don’t know. 

And if I even attempt to set any boundaries she will probably cause a huge scene and guilt trip me. She would definitely drive up to my apartment too 5 hours from her. I just don’t even know what to do. Can anyone relate to this situation??"
"So in the many arguments my parents have had, my mother would bring up the fact that my dad’s actions, his abuse, would lead to me sobbing about wanting to end my life.

This is true but I have never been able to fully go through with it. Always too scared. 

Today, my dad was picking out clothes for me as I have a college visit at a very prestigious university tomorrow morning. I didn’t want him to go into my room because it’s a depressive mess right now and I know he’d only make snide remarks to make me feel bad about myself. But he didn’t listen to me and went upstairs anyway. 

For some reason this just made me crack and I fell to my knees and started silently sobbing. My mom was upset that I was stressing her out, my brother was instigating to make me feel worse, and my dad was just being himself. 

I tried to go downstairs to breathe and be alone so I could recollect myself but my dad ordered I go to my room and help him. When I did he just started complaining that I have no nice clothes (he doesnt buy me clothes) and I just started shaking because his wave of insults and stupidity was only just starting. 

He later started rambling, asking me what would I do if I lost my memory and he was the only person I remembered. I dont know what I was thinking, but I lost it and said I’d kill myself. I gave him details, telling him the exact way I used to think of doing it and he told me to stop talking.

He got quiet and ended up leaving me alone. I dont know if he cares, I don’t think he ever will care. But what I do know now is that I hate this crazy family. College couldn’t come any sooner at this point and I’m sick of waiting. "
"this is weird I’ve never posted on reddit but I don’t know where else I could even begin to ask these questions.. how do you even begin to get a foot in the door in your life ? 
Bit of backstory, back when I was a child my father lived with me- till the age of 15. I’m 17 now.
My father was abusive sexually, physically, mentally and emotionally until he had to move out from a restraining order along with my brother ( 19, 17 at the time.) because they were found out for sexually abusing me and siblings, along with cp. 

They moved in 2021, so it’s been awhile. I should mention my mother was also heavily abused so this next part makes any sense

After my father and brother moved out, it was just me , my mother and little sister, and immediately my mother fell into depression ( as you would ), but ever since things have honestly amped up and she’s became the abuser. My mother isn’t half as bad, no sexual abuse, very limited physical abuse like she may kick me once or twice but the emotional abuse is insane. 

She gaslights me everyday- over stupid things, then says I’m gaslighting her.

Some examples: 
“where did you get the toilet paper from?- mum” , “
the one on the handle”- me , 
“there isn’t one on the handle” - mum,
“Well? There was?”- me
“You’re lying. You got it from the basket”
“No I didn’t.” 
“You’re gaslighting me !”- mum

Or, she’ll scream at me that I don’t care about her and how I’m a manipulative psychopath because she asked for a can of coke so I gave her one instead of pouring it into a cup, thinking she wanted the can of coke as is, and when I tried to communicate and ask her to specify next time so I don’t mess up again she screams at me and accuses me of being just like my father.

She takes it so far to say outlandish things like 
“You’re intelligence is too low to be able to do *insert normal thing*”
“You had a part in your childhood rape with your father”
“You’re hiding something from me about your father”
“you’re secretly running me down to all your friends”
“You’re manipulating me all the time just to get whatever you want”
“you’re planning on running away”
“Everyone at your university hates you”
“All your friends mothers hate you”
“Everyone is going to leave you once they see how abusive you are”
And the list goes on. I’m not saying the worst of it because if she ever finds this she’ll deny it anyways .

It even came to the point where I told my mother about the 11k fee on my uni, considering I’m 17 and have no job ( due to me not being allowed to have one , even tho I’ve begged) she said she’d pay it, BEFORE I even applied. Then when I applied she said she refused to pay it. She made me forge her signature, I have proof of her texting me to do it. She made that loophole so she didn’t have to pay because she didn’t sign. She held it over my head and refused to pay until last minute and proceeded to scream at me that she never said she wouldn’t pay it, and I’m gaslighting her, even though both my psychologist and boyfriend witnessed her saying she refused multiple times. I called her at uni stressing because she refused to pay and made me sound like a gaslighter in front of everyone on the phone. And even now she says that I manipulated her into paying the 11k and I never even told her she had to pay it before I applied, I have audio of this.

She’s attempted to kick me out multiple times, and then gets mad at me when I leave and guilt trips me saying how sad I’ve made my sister. The most recent time I went to my friends ( now boyfriend’s) house for awhile and it was good but I eventually always have to come back and face this abusive shit again. 

I’m also very much blind ( need glasses to see 99% of things) and my mother promised to get them fixed for me, they’ve broken in all ways they can. And she’s ’too depressed’ to help me. 

I’ve recorded many many audios of her screaming and my friends have pointed out she sounds slurred in her speech and isn’t making much sense , and I agree.

I don’t have my own bank account, I’m attempting to open one, I cannot fix my glasses and I am in extreme need of glasses to do much of anything, I have untreated health issues, and practically no form of escape.

Does anyone have ANY tips of what I may be able to do? I’ve been thinking about just sticking my head into uni and I’m trying but she’s taken away my uni work at points, and I’ve been talking to my psychologist but I haven’t told her all of it because I’m scared of what may happen. I’ve had friends recommend doctors and social workers so I am looking into that but does anyone know any tricks on how to make my mother not blow up about random things? It’s honestly so crushing every time I have to go home, from school or friends places, It’s been years now of it and I’m turning 18 next year, I know once I’m 18 she’s kicking me out for good so I’m preparing to go overseas for uni. I’m an artist- should have mentioned that, art uni. I’ve been thinking about commissions, and getting paid for those. Or talking to teachers at uni and getting extensions on work so I have more time to get my things together. 

The shitty part of this is she’s my only parent left and I’ve watched her go from abused to abuser and it’s horrifying thinking about my future with her - or lack there of because I cannot exist near her without her blowing up. I have many pets I adore and refuse to leave behind so I know I’m well trapped for many years to come, and my friends have warned me there is no way of stopping the abuse, only escaping. I just really need a foot in the door to fix things. Cleaning the whole house is never enough- being kind isn’t enough, being successful in school isn’t enough, nothing is enough for her. She refused to care even when I was struggling with self harm to the point of my muscle being visible. Nothing works, she beats down my self esteem so much so I can’t leave . “Your friends hate you, they’ll kick you out” so I feel extremely uncomfortable reaching out for help, she lies to my psychologist so I feel odd trying to express myself there. She’s drowning me in all this shit and I need help..

"The title is pretty self explanatory.
My mom and I had the typical fight which led to her yelling about how awful and painful her life is... All because of me being an over demanding bitch.
Cue a long fight later she couldn't name one thing I demanded. I didn't demand any food or drink, I requested something once in June 😶‍🌫️ and she happily agreed because she liked the food product. I specifically was ready to quit therapy despite trying to work on myself because I can't drive yet and she was yelling at me for wasting time on therapy (she doesn't pay for it). I just can't understand??? Why have a kid if you're going to throw a tantrum every time said kid needs something???? I get it's annoying but again that's the fucking point? This is ignoring the fact that throughout my childhood she didn't let me even act like a child ( I wasn't allowed to be loud or messy, or even have hobbies she didn't approve of) and to this day she still judges and insults my hobbies.
Sorry for the post I just needed to rant , badly"
"I’m not really sure what to do anymore, I still live at home with my narcissistic/alcoholic mom and it’s heavily weighing on me mentally to the point that I feel stretched extremely thin.  And about every week she gets super drunk and says the most nastiest thing imaginable, getting in my face and occasionally getting physical (pushing/grabbing etc). When I was younger my dad was extremely verbally abusive, not to mention extremely narcissistic, this has caused a lot of issues for me and I’m still trying to work through it. That’s why when this happens with my mom it triggers me even further. I can’t afford to live anywhere else at the moment and with each argument she raises my rent price. I word two jobs and I am in my last semester of college, I work extremely hard and push myself because I know I deserve the life I want to live. My mom knows this and still threatens making me homeless if I don’t do chores to her pristine liking. No one knows what I’m going through besides my boyfriend and he helps as much as he can always listening and opening to his doors in the nights that it gets so bad that I have to leave. I guess all I’m really looking for is some type of community so I know I’m not alone, I don’t know all I know is that I am really hurting. I’ve called the cops on her before, didn’t really help much and I’m just at a loss. I’ve tried complying and not talking back when she gets like this and to no avail. I’ve tried to just not engage and then she gets upset because she feels like we don’t have a relationship anymore."
"before I go and type away my thoughts, I would like to give a trigger warning, as this pertains to my experience with sexual assault, rape, abusive relationships, and victim blaming.

I'd like to preface that I'm not much for lying - I'm bad at it and I think it rarely serves a purpose. If this isn't a mindset that makes sense, that's fair, I'm autistic. Also as of writing, I'm f20. I apologize that  it's so long; I wanted to give full context and honestly just talk about all of it.

Today (14/08/24), I decided to go to McDonald's with my mother. She had been bothering me about how late I stay working at the desk and wanted to go out with me; hungry, I obliged. While inside, we noticed a rather uncomfortable situation - a mother with her two daughters and a man that we assumed to be her partner or possibly her children's father. This man was all over her and seemed generally unhelpful despite the mother dealing with her children, his posture was one I later called the ""broke baby daddy stance"" (if you know you know). Once we had finished eating and left the restaurant my mother commented on how she didn't like when men relied on women to pay. She specified that although men don't need to pay for anything, she finds this weird (I would like to clarify that my mother's opinions are not automatically my own). I went on to recall how my ex-boyfriend, who I dated when I was 18-19 (\~3 months) did this - to the point that the day he dumped me he had made me drive us to McDonald's, pay for our food, and drive back to his parents' house before he broke up with me. He was 19, ""broke"" (not really), and unemployed. I told her how when we first started dating he would pay for everything, leading me to believe he was more well-off and more generous than he actually was. It's hard to remember the exact unfolding of the conversation, but she asked if I really was staying the night in a guest room when I stayed at his parents' house, and I admitted that I had lied about that. For context, my mom is a conservative catholic woman who believes sex is strictly for marriage. She then interrogated me, asking what his parents thought (they didn't care) and what kind of example I was setting for his younger sister (she naturally assumed we must've been having loud sex - something I do find concerning as I feel she frequently sexualizes me in unnecessary ways). This led to the topic of how in that relationship I felt pressure to have sex early on. I told him I wanted to wait - I had felt used before and wanted it to feel right. This didn't matter and he was persistent. My mom asked why I didn't just leave - after all, I had a car. She said, ""It's not like he would have forced himself on you"". That is not something I know. After all, he didn't seem particularly against coorsion, something that happened frequently while we were dating. She told me how she ""taught me to say no"" and to not be pressured. I disagree; if that were true maybe we wouldn't be here. I mentioned how I feel as though I never learned how to set boundaries properly, and that I never felt comfortable saying no. We then discussed how she adamantly didn't like the man I dated before him; he was 25 when I dated him. I was 18. I'm not a fan of him either; he was equally manipulative and didn't do well with boundaries. My mom mentioned her fondness for the man I had just broken up with. He was 24, and a very sweet person on the surface. But just like the others, he was manipulative, although perhaps not intentionally, and I was tired of feeling like I wasn't being listened to. When we pulled into our driveway, I mentioned how I may choose to only date women after this failed relationship (I'm pansexual). I mention how I am scared of sex and intimacy and being with women these issues can be more easily navigated. She asks if I've ever been forced and I don't answer. She asks this because in her mind that could be the only reason I fear intimacy now, despite what I've just told her. When I choose not to answer she begins guessing who it was until I tell her - it was the 20-year-old man I dated at 17. She asks how, and why I didn't tell her, and I say it was at a party I wasn't supposed to be at. She continues interrogating; was I high? Yes. Who was there? him and his friends. Why didn't I yell, scream, get someone to intervene? I don't know. I think I was too scared to tell her I didn't really know what was happening, I was high and confused and maybe to me it felt like the closest thing to love in a while. So when he threatened to do it anyway if I said no I didn't fight it. I didn't fight his hand on my mouth as I made noise from the pain. I was a good victim. She mentioned that maybe I should talk to my dad about this - he might have some perspective. I wasn't looking for advice or perspective though; I was simply answering the questions she threw at me at this point. She gave a couple, ""This is why I didn't want you staying over"" and other I told you so like remarks. She eventually gives me a, somewhat unwelcome, hug and I carry on with my work in the presence of my cat. Fast forward to later this evening, I am called down to eat and as to not upset her I abandon the movie I had been watching. As I finish eating, my mom begins, in front of my dad, mentioning how now on I'm not allowed to have any sleepovers with anyone. I would like to remind you that I am a full adult, who has been living with the trauma from my mistakes for up to 5 years now, because as my parents are currently unaware of, my brother's best friend assaulted me when I was 15. This wasn't my first experience with assault or harassment, but it was the first that was deeply traumatizing. My mother said that if I disagreed with this I could move out. I currently live (rent-free) with my parents while I go to university and although I do appreciate this it doesn't give my parents the right to control my life outside of the home (in my opinion). Also; these exact rules are what got me in trouble in the first place. The night I was raped when I was 17 I wanted to call someone. The night had started with a lighter assault; him touching my breasts inappropriately while I was very crossed (weed & alcohol). I wanted to leave. But I was more scared of my parents' reaction to me being where I wasn't supposed to be than I was of what was happening. I stayed adamant that being assaulted WASN'T my fault. But although she agreed, she said it was my fault for getting in that situation and being high. I'll admit that it was stupid - I was naive and honestly just excited to be seen and wanted the way I felt like I wasn't. But I also mentioned that I didn't learn comprehensively about consent. My mom said I was trying to blame her and my dad - and the truth is part of me does. If I felt safe talking to them about things maybe I would have reported. Maybe it wouldn't have taken me so long to realise what happened was wrong. She said that she hates seeing me hurt - and that's why she's being like this - but she didn't see me hurt. I made myself heal and get better on my own. She wasn't there for any of that. And no, she didn't teach me to set boundaries, since she has been violating mine constantly. The fact that she even brought up the issue to him without even asking me proves it.

I guess I just want someone on my side. I have therapy tomorrow but I'm not sure I can wait that long to get this off my chest. Please someone just tell me I'm not crazy."

okay this is just a rant that i really need to get off my chest so please ignore this or don’t it’s completely up to u. me and my dad got into a verbal and physical fight a few days ago and my mom was there she didn’t do or say anything which is pretty normal when this happens but after i went to my room. she came to my room and told me that she didn’t know how this would effect me (meaning the fight) and if i could stay a live till friday bc her birthday was Thursday (this was on a tuesday btw). Im just baffled like verbal and physical fights are normal so i don’t know why ur saying this now but why would u say that.

I was unaware she did this and suddenly she put it on the back of my arm and it was scorching hot, I still feel “ghost burns”. There is a dark mark on the back of my arm but I was taken a back and shocked and a let out a scream. My dad scolded her for a minute and then went and sided with her after she started acting like the victim and was bringing up past fights as damage control trying to pin me as the bad guy and that it wasn’t so bad and gaslighting and manipulating me saying she wish she boiled it longer, put it on my skin for longer and telling my family members it wasn’t even that hot, and tearing it on their skin after it cooled, it left a dark burn mark. I don’t deserve this treatment. Am I a human or animal? An hour later i had a meeting with my manager I had to act normal and fine even when I was not and burned by my mother, he was scolding me in the meeting. I also quit my job because of the stress, my life sucks. Today they are acting like everything is ok and nothing happened and still trying to gaslight me, it’s very unfortunate.

"For my whole life, my father has abused me. He's shown he doesn't care for me. Today, my Grandma told me about how my dad worries about me. I don't know what to believe anymore. If he was worried about me, why does he hurt me?"
I am 17 years old and I graduated high school last December almost a year ago. I wanted to go to college at first and then decided I didn’t want to go because I already have a full time job and in my opinion is a waste of time and money. My grandma asked me about it and I said that I didn’t want to go and she started saying that I needed to go to school and I needed to be excited for it and to be honest thinking about it stresses me out. Now she is currently forcing me to enroll after i have told her multiple times I wasn’t going. Sorry for the rant. 
"This is long, sorry. Using my throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I lived with my mom growing up. We’re NC now and have been for years. I knew she was abusive and thought I remembered a few particularly horrible things she’d done but wasn’t sure if they were real memories because they seemed too extreme. 

I’ve been NC with her whole side of the family for the last 20 years but recently got back in touch with one of her brothers. I remember liking him when I met him as a kid but I only met him about six times in total. 

We’ve ended up in similar jobs and we connected on LinkedIn, got talking and decided to have a zoom call. He’s been going to therapy recently and has been processing a lot about his childhood. I asked what had happened to him and he described his mom doing to him the exact same horrible things I’d thought I remembered mine doing to me. So either both of us have independently come up with f’d up false memories, or it all actually happened and my mom got it from hers. 

Then he told me his mom had poisoned him several times. She was a pharmacist (so is mine) so knew what she was doing. She apparently mostly just made him really sick but one time nearly killed him and his stepdad saved his life by rushing him to the ER where they confirmed he’d been poisoned. 

This was a lot to take in so I was debriefing with my best friend from childhood over a G&T a few days later and she went “Moll, I hate to say this but remember all those weird sudden-onset illnesses you had when we were kids? That stopped when you left home?” And I was like… oh SHIT. We looked up the symptoms of poisoning with the specific things we knew my grandma had used on my uncle and the symptoms all match the mysterious “illnesses” I had as a kid/teenager. 

Anyway TL;DR my mom picked up a bunch of severely abusive behaviours from her mom and did them on me. I’ve just realized she probably also poisoned me throughout my childhood. 

Dunno what the point of this post is really, just in a bit of a 🤯😳🫥 "
"Yesterday I (23F) hit my mom for the first time in my life. My sister and me have been constantly abused by my parents , my mom is severely narcisstic and she has been abusing us mentally and physically for years. My dad usually just keeps himself out of it but there was 1 time at the age of 12 where he grabbed my mom by the throat and i remember trying to protect her by hitting him and she telling me I'm a bad daughter because i hit my dad. Yesterday i got an immense trigger because i heard my sister telling her to stop and when i went into my sister's room i saw my mom laying on her with her full body weight trying to snatch her phone just because she said she was hungry but didn't end up making any food.
So i hit her on the back to get her off of my sister and she immediately slapped my face telling me that if i touch her again she will put me in a coma.

I feel guilty of hitting a human but i don't feel guilty of hitting her because I was protecting my little sister."
"Background: 21f and my 24f sister have had to deal with a severely abusive mother and an abusive/neglectful father. Mother has tried to villainize us in front of our dad, and vice versa, which is why he never took our side when she verbally, physically, and sexually assaulted us. 

Current situation: 

We thought it would get better after we graduated because it would prove to our parents that we were capable. Things were initially okay but quickly deteriorated in July and we have been trapped in our rooms since. Our mother makes up scenarios to villainise us to our dad and our relatives. We try to avoid her to minimize conflict which means we get to eat only at odd times whenever she locks herself in her room. She hasn't been cooking any proteinaceous food so we have been losing weight and have constant brain fog which is worsening every day. She cooks food we specifically do not like, is too bland or too spicy which basically means we don't ever have a full meal. She has called us cancers. She keeps urging our father to have us kicked out. Our father doesn't take her side and thinks we are provoking her to behave in this manner. We just want out. But we don't have uae currency to get a way out and don't have that many rupees to securely start our life in India. Our health is deteriorating. I cannot focus on anything. I live in constant fear of her pulling some new trick or barging into our rooms. I am hyper aware of every sound she makes because if she goes into her room, that means I can't go drink water or eat something. I can't live like this for too long

We need to know what our options are considering our age and situation. We only have money in rupees because we have only earned in India. Our father only tries to keep the family together to keep up his image in society. No one interacts with us. If we leave, authorities will have to be involved or we need to run away without most of our belongings. Our aim is not to present a sob story to get money out of people. We need to know our options. We need to have a plan. What are some things that we should/should not do?"
"This is going to sound stupid but I'm not sure if my parents are abusive or just conservative with some mental health issues. 

Sometimes they call me a liar and irresponsible and talk about my body negatively. They've slut shamed me in the past and even called me an attention seeker after i fainted at the dining table. they belittle me, call my partner prettier then me... and say i express myself as ""poor"" to get people's pity. Once they've even yelled at me in front of a hundred or two students after the school called them to pick me up because i was sick (with strep AND mono).

but this isn't all the time. sometimes they're nice and gift me things and do things for me. there's good moments and because of that i'm not sure if they're abusive.

i'd really like to know if this would be considered abuse?"
"Hello! I was looking for advice on how to help someone who wants to leave an abusive household but feels too guilty to do so. My (f19)s boyfriend (M19) lives in an abusive household. I won't go into details as it is not my story to tell, and he is an avid reddit user. I'm not the greatest at wording things, so I'll just try and explain how he said he feels. He said he feels guilty to leave and that a barrier is stopping him. He says even the thought makes him feel sick and horrible. He knows he needs to leave but at the same time can't bring himself to. I'm not sure if this is normal or what to do. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he just breaks down and says i can't do it, i won't ever be able to do it, and I don't even know why. Any advice or tips?"
"She made fun of my things because they're for children and childrens toys. I said they're collectables. They were high end Barbies that accumulate in value over the years (see Silkstone Barbies for example). She said bullshit and rolled her eyes. About the clothes I asked what people? She wouldn't answer that

I so fucking wish I could move out

I'm really trying to lose weight but she keeps sabotaging my attempts."

"(Trigger warning suicide and abused)

Well I've never done something like this, never said what I'm going to say. 

When I was growing up I was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome quite young infact I was in pre school, from what I remember as a kid I was hyper,couldn't sit still, cause trouble ,lashed out.

My father not a nice man left pretty soon after I have few memories of him but what I do remember still sits in my mind, he once ripped a chickens head off infront of me because I left the pen door open, another my parents separated and he promised to take me to the local show (like a county fair for the usappl) but never showed I waited in the window for him to come but he never did, my mum, aunt and grandmother took me instead and I saw him there with a new family.


My mum while she tried so hard she sadly also had flaws one of them her rage.  Now I don't doubt I was hard, harder than anything she had faced in her life before but I was a kid and a broken one at that, my mum would get angry not alot but often enough. It could have been my behaviour at home or school or while out. It could have just been a bad day and I added the last tipping point, the point being happy to someone I never recognised, 

The sound of her voice for ever lives in my mind strained forced through gritted teeth, saying things that cut my soul in half, idk why or what it was  but I would feel this feeling just above my sternum and  just below my throat this feeling it wasn't pain but it hurt it felt like a balloon I couldn't pop filling that area id want to cry but all that would happen was little gasps of air, I haven't felt that in so long but I can remember it vividly. 

The feeling of her fist or palms and later legs, we all got smacked as kids it was inevitable part of life but not like this, this felt like a champion kick boxer rocked my shit for the world championship belt and you best believe she won. Her blows laying seeds in my mind to never strike people unless I had to because inflicting this sort of pain on people is terrible, 

As I grew it became accepted In my mind I guess, I thought it was normal to be treated this way that it was punishment for how I was, that I deserved it for being different, my diagnosis got defined in my early school years to ADD/ADHD, meds got introduced at first it was a horrible new drug Ritalin turned me into a living zombie, no appetite or emotion tired while the effects lasted, I was manageable (I don't blame her for meds hell I sought them out as an adult) I hated it I hated what I became on them,  

I think she did too but with them we could go out, go shopping or other stuff and I'd just follow blankly, until they'd wear off and I'd start to be me again, not always but sometimes me being me would flip that switch and I'd just know when we got home I'd be getting it, I could feel it in the air thick with rage, 


Into my teen years puberty and I know see as acute depression and a hatred for my meds, I'd skip or spit them as much as I could this would lead to situations at school, where I'd be a fool a clown a spiteful shit or rageful myself with words, 

So calls home would be made suspensions detentions the works  all leading back to the rage, 
A cycle on repeat until I broke. After countless nights of cutting words or sudden right hooks my brain just imploded on itself, I attempted I stole my grandfathers 22lr walked to middle of nowhere loaded a round put it in my mouth and pulled the trigger...... no bang ( pa removed the firing pin didn't know this)  with the taste of metal and gun lube in my mouth I returned the items and went home.

I'm 26 now live with my partner a cat and a dog, work an ok job, I see my mum a decent amount and despite above I love her never spoken about the past but  everytime I see her there's a part of me that remembers wants to run away, but sadly I see in her that she remembers too and wants to take it all back.

Well shit that was a wall huh "
"My birth mom and dad were a loving couple and had 3 of us kids together. They moved to California for the naval base my dad was serving for. I was born in cali and shorty after my dad honorably discharged from the navy due to martial discrepancies(birth mom cheated). Anways, fast word to meeting the demon. So apparently she was also on the same naval base as my parents and was in a relationship and pregnant with my step bro at the time. When she first met my dad she wanted him and would stop at nothing to get him. For context this woman was not the type my dad would go for she was really manly and would burp and fart she was bigger and was not into exercise. I’m listing all those things because my father loves fitness, very handsome and he had high standards because he kept amazing care of himself. Cutting back this woman took it upon herself to let my father know (while being away in another country )by writing him a letter of my birth mother’s unfaithfulness. After my father arrived back at the base the navy gave him an ultimatum which forced him to honorably discharge. After we left California the loud obnoxious Philly woman followed. And that’s where the horror story begins…"
"I suppose this would fit the topic. I'm a 21[M] living with my 17 yearold Brother and Mother. [We live in Thailand, and my father is Japanese] My parents didn't officially divorce but they split.

I'll cut it short because it's not the first time. When I was a child and teenager I did horrible things that I don't even remember, and somehow it led to destroying my mother's life because I was close to my father [Who was involved with a lot of criminally things]. I've always loved her and cared for her even though she never believed it. She has her good moments, and worse ones. 

I had a knack to journal my feelings, overly share things when I was younger, and she never liked it. Even though I changed, she never seemed to have changed her view of me. 

When she starts to rant, she'd grab the most ridiculous things from the past, and bring it up like it's so hilarious, including my mistakes. I tried to reason with her, deflect her insults and kept trying to make her understand that her arguments are ridiculous. She can't have a normal argument without being incredibly vulgar, or insults. And I was an idiot for even trying. 

The last time I told someone, they ratted out on me, or abandoned me. They all said, including her, that I was ungrateful because all the sacrifices she did for me, and all those meals she searched far and wide just to make me happy. 

It has been going on for all my life, and it's not the first time I tried reasoning with her, or defending myself then ended up injured. I developed some kind of continuous seizures lately, and she was the only one who 'Saved' me. 

Yesterday, I was in the middle of a call with my long distance boyfriend when my mother suddenly started her usual rants over a frozen towel that was for my seizures I took out [I didn't know she wanted it to be completely frozen so I took it out] I stayed quiet for a while, then I started trying to defend myself, reasoning with her ridiculous assumptions. It all went downhill when my boyfriend chimed in, and insulted her. [It was my fault on that, I didn't want to hang up the call.] 

She started going manic, absolutely insane. With every attempt I asked her for evidence, she retorted with vulgar insults, after insults For 4-5 hours. Things went south when she got physical, I blocked her with my arms, but I got scratched pretty badly, and my right arm is still sore after everything. She kept repeating if I wanted to die, making disturbing deaththreats while waving the knife. She made my boyfriend apologized publicly Infront of her via call or else she'd hurt me. 

We haven't spoken after that. Though she still continues her rants and her insults. I wanted to tell my father, but he's in Japan. Not to mention, he's old and sick. I was forbidden from telling him of any information about my actual current situation, or else I'd be homeless. Even now I still put up the act for money. 

I'm afraid, that if I told him the truth, he'd leave me and abandon me behind. If he abandons me, my mother would catch on, and I don't want to get hurt or lose my life. 

I know what I have to do. I'm still waiting for my job application so I can afford an apartment. I can't leave right away because of finance. I can't tell anyone because I know they will turn their backs on me. I don't want to be homeless either, but I don't know how long can I take this treatment. 

She's not entirely a good mother, she has her ups and her downs. I know she sacrificed everything for me, but is it enough to say, that this is all my doing? My fault? 

I don't know how to feel..I don't know how to cope with her..I don't know how to cope with my own emotions. I'm scared, Tired, exhausted, confused, sad? I don't know how to handle this anymore. I tried to talk with my brother but he just ignored me. I was warned, I had it coming. God dammit.."
"What can I do, I am not able to support myself yet and I live with my mother post father’s death. She has become more physically and verbally abusive, and the physical part is really bad. I used to assume victims could get out of the situation easily but now I see the complicated nature of abusive households. How do I continue to live in here, if I call the cops my life is completely ruined? "
"What should I do, I’m not able to support myself yet, my mother turned very physically abusive and verbally abusive, after my father’s death. I can’t go out to live by myself, but if I call the police, the life I live will be seriously affected. What should I do, I always thought victims could do simple things and be fine, but the nuances are very complicated I see now."
"my mom is forcing me to drink and consume unpasteurized dairy products. i'm lactose intolerant and she claims it will ""fix me"" (i'm the only member of my family who has lactose intolerance). i'm really scared of getting sick and i don't even like dairy.

she claims that if i do not comply she will take my phone away permanently (meaning never getting a phone until i buy one myself which she will probably take away too), no longer give me rides to work (i dont have a car or a license), and won't help me with getting into college, or anything else really. basically disowning me apart from still letting me live in her house and eat. but she has tried to kick me out multiple times over smaller issues, so I wouldn't be surprised if she did.

what should I do? she made me drink it twice and my stomach is *killing* me. i also really dont want to drink it because the idea of drinking milk with tons of bacteria in it is nasty. should i just comply and wait until I'm 18 to leave? i'm 17, turning 18 in dec"
"My mom kicked out my ten year old sister. 

Okay, small TINY backstory. My mom is... She's loving, she can be generous, I love her to pieces, but it's complicated. 

She's very in her own head. It's always about what she wants and feels. I've been sculpted into such a person, that I have a dog complex. I related so hard, that in my adulthood I've cried and put myself in the dog cage when I believed I was in the wrong, because it's what I deserved. I was turned into an insanely loving and doting person, with no regard for myself. I don't matter. I only exist in the context of what I can do for others. 

My sister is stronger than I am. She isn't allowing herself to be molded. She isn't rolling over and submitting like me, and she isn't playing the game back like my middle sister (who became physically abusive to both me and the little one). She's FIGHTING BACK. 

And it's causing problems. You can't get along with them if you don't play the game. They'll team up on you. 

Mom always ""kicks us out"". It's a thing. She threw me at the grandparents, Middle at her dad, and Youngest to me. 

To me. 

Who has recently been crippled due to suspected seizure activity. 

Me, who can barely walk anymore. 

Who lives under the poverty line in a broken trailer with a collapsing floor and holes in the walls. 

Me, who lives in an area with cartel, trafficking, and drug activity, in a home that was burgled twice in the last two years. 

Me, with my husband who is already at his wit's end caring for his deteriorating wife. 

With our single income. 

With no car. 

I knew it would happen. We had been planning in case. But I thought I had time. It's just. 

Oh my god. It's happening. 

This is no place to raise a child. These aren't the conditions I want for her. But, oh my god... As if I would ever turn her away. 

Mom's in one ear, complaining how the youngling isn't affectionate, is cold and unfeeling, doesn't care about anyone and would rather be with anyone else but family. 

My baby is in my other ear, crying how they make her feel powerless, like she has no privacy, no agency, how she's afraid of getting yelled at all the time, how the middle child constantly lies about her, how they touch her (non-sexually but in ways that disconcert her) against her wishes, how she feels like no one wants her to exist besides my husband and I. 

Meanwhile, my husband and I adore her. We think she's the most amazing, perfect kid. Me and the husband lived with her a good deal, and I spent most of her life co-parenting her. I was a stay at home mom until she turned two. She's affectionate, helpful, thoughtful. She's absolutely respectless when it comes to roasts and humor, but husband and I are similar. Bullying each other is a love language, and the kid is fluent. We warn and correct if she goes too far, but I don't really see the need to correct her teasing. It's fun, and the husband and I enjoy it.  

Husband and I are both ADHD + Autistic, so we're very... Particular. She's witnessed both of us go nonverbal multiple times. We're big on boundaries and keeping each other (her included) as comfortable as possible, and it mystifies her.

My husband gets visibly upset watching my mom and middle sister interact with her... He's ready and willing to keep her indefinitely. 

I tried talking mom down. I tried to talk her into family counseling or therapy. She didn't want to hear it, and quote, said, ""Tell her I don't want her, anymore. I'm done with her."" A nervous laugh and telling her I wouldn't be passing along that message, her threatening to tell her herself, me pleading not to do that to a ten year old. 

And. Um. 

My crippled ass is a parent. 

So yeah. 

My neurology appointment is tomorrow, the same time as meet the teacher day. 

Oh goodness. 

Wish me luck. 

I'm happy, I LOVE her, she's my baby. But I am so worried about keeping the damage and fallout minimized. 

Fuck. "
"I have a trans, autistic sibling whos in 7th grade, and I actually feel so damn bad for him. He's 12 and our mom is 51. He ordered a binder at some point since he's more 'developed' than other kids his age and wanted to hide his breasts for obvious reasons. When he got the package, my mom pressured him to open it, and then she interrogated him, and then said that she can't let him wear it, and that he needs to accept being a girl, and refused to let him have the binder that he paid for with his own money. She yelled at him and hit him over it.   
  
Before this, when he cut his hair and felt so happy, he felt like he looekd good, just for our parents to scream and him and just ruin that small bout of joy he had. Now, ever since the binder incident when he was forced to come out to her, she's been making comments on his breasts or butt, sometimes she just outright tells him he looks fat, and he feels horrible.

This actualyl fucked him up so goddamn bad. He genuinely hates himself. He has really bad memory and forgets things that our mom tells him to do, just for him to be screamed at and feeling like he can't do anything right, like he doesn't even deserve to be in this house. He feels like he isn't deserving of food or water because he forgets to pick up something as insignificant as a bottle cap or a paper towel and just stopped eating, he feels like he doesn't deserve to be clean and outright stopped showering. He thought of overdosing on his Risperidone because he believed he wasn't even deserving of life.

Not to mention, at some point our mom got so mad at him that she called his damn middle school and made sure he wouldn't pass, as an all B-student. She even changed his 504 plan to sit close to teachers even though he told her feels extremely uncomfortable around adults because of the way she touches him, and told him that ""Maybe he'll learn his lesson"". She even calls him the R slur because he doesn't talk to others, and she just overall does things that make him feel like a piece of shit. I want to help him so bad, but I don't know how."
"This is really strange. I started crying about it unexpectedly and can’t tell if I’m being overly dramatic, which I might be—I've always had a flair for the dramatic.

I was scrolling through my mom’s Facebook account and came across some very old pictures from around 2008 or 2010 of me and my parents.

I looked so happy, especially with my father. I don’t remember having any good memories of him growing up; they’ve all been overshadowed by yelling, fighting, and beatings. Yet, in those pictures, we looked so happy. I don’t understand why, and I don’t recall what our relationship was like back then. We just appeared so content together. When I got home today, my dad was speaking harshly about me, saying how disappointing I’ve become. I feel like a disappointment, and he has every right to be angry. I just wish I could have my dad back. I wish so deeply that we were different people with different lives and then maybe that way I would finally be able to love him and he would love me as well. 

Just now, my mom told me to go to bed because my dad seems very angry with me, and it feels like everyone downstairs is having so much fun without me. They’re literally watching Wolverine knowing I love marvel more than anyone else. No one even asked for me besides my baby brother and they’re about to order dinner while I haven’t eaten anything but a turkey and cheese sandwich my grandma gave me. 

It just seems like things would be so much better if I was gone. "
"So I’m 29F   I have had to cut out all family. I have my mom, dad, step mom, 3 brothers and 2 sisters. I am literally the most dogged on one. My dad and step mom take my half sister and brothers side 100% of the time. For instance, my sister got pregnant at 16 by an almost 40 year old, (after accusing my dad of assault mind you) I was actually assaulted by my father and never got the chance to stand up while my sister dropped her charges against him and said she made it up. My step mom use to put me in cold showers to “punish my rebellious behavior” but it’s like a let’s stay by them because they are “their kids”.  My mom has been a constant abuser, I remember so many things from my childhood with her such as smacking us in the shower so she didn’t leave marks, standing us on the wall while the family ate because we spilled glitter etc. 
She continues to do it in my adulthood by calling me hateful and a bunch of fuck yous when she doesn’t like something I do, and even downs me as a mother. Her son (my other half brother that she praises) is also an abuser of mine but according to her I made it up to play “games” but I have vivid memories at 29. My point is, I’m losing all hope as a person and a mother. I feel like I’m constantly the problem, unloveable, and don’t understand why out of all my siblings and with my parents why I’m looked down on. I raised my siblings, was essentially a maid for both parents and had my own kids at 19 and have done nothing not even asked my parents for a penny since having my children.  Sorry for the ramble and there is so much more but in this can you answer am I the problem? If not, why did they choose me to abuse?"
"I just watched the movie Big Fish for the first time because my girlfriend loves it.  We just ended the night with an agreement that we needed to stop discussing the movie because I was getting too upset. It's okay - my GF is great, we just couldn't see eye to eye on the movie, and I took a hard hit to the feels.

SPOILERS: the movie culminates in an adult child basically (in my opinion) playing into his father's self-egrandizing fairy tales as his father dies.  My girlfriend saw this as him healing and recognizing his father always loved him, even if he was bad at showing it.  All I saw was a child yet again accommodating their narcissistic parent.  His father never apologized for the fact that he was rarely around.  He made every event and situation about him boosting himself with his tall tales.  I couldn't see this as a narrative of reconciliation, rather one of a child adapting for an absent parent again and again.

My mother died in May.  I hadn't spoken to her in years because she was a narcissistic abuser and wasn't safe to keep in my life.  She entered end of life and it took nearly a week for her to pass.  After 5ish days of declining, I chose to go see her because I felt that she might need closure to move on.  So I sat with her.  Played a favorite song of hers.  I told her I loved her.  I told her the good things I was doing with my life so she could know that she'd at least raised kids who put good out in the world.  These were all true.  They didn't mean I had forgiven her, but I had enough love in me to try and give her that peace so she could move on.  She died about a day later.  I'm proud of myself for doing that, because I think it helped her and it felt like the right thing to do.  But I didn't owe her that, and I deserved so much better.

I watched this movie and I didn't see the parts where this grown child grieved that their parent had largely abandoned them.  I didn't see him get an apology.  I didn't see him rage about the worthlessness it instills in a kid to know their parent considers them an afterthought at best.  I just saw the forgiveness of this asshole who never once acknowledged that he'd always been focused on himself, his story, his grandeur.  And wouldn't you know?  He'd been something of a hero for the downtrodden.  Cool.  My mom worked for years with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and was quite lovely to her clients.  She was still an awful mother.  So watching this movie, all I could think was, what about being a hero for his fuckin kid?  What about expending that effort and energy at home?  It's less exciting to be a hero to your kid - admiration earned is tastier than admiration owed.  

I feel bad because my GF loves this movie.  And I feel like I shit all over it.  I know she understands my perspective, but I also feel badly that I couldn't just enjoy a damn movie.  It's frustrating and I feel simultaneously silly and sad and hurt.  

It's been a rough night.  Thanks to anyone who gives this a read.  Just needed to vent."
"[Sexual Harrassment warning]

One year for 4th of July weekend when I was in high school my mom planned to take me,my bff, my little brother and her bf to go camping at the beach. Me and My bff was 16 at the time. We stayed at a camp grounds close to the boardwalk. My mom basically made me and my friend babysit my brother the whole trip while they got high and if we didn't do what my brother wanted my mom would yell at me. Both me and my friend didn't get any say over anything during the whole trip as well. It sucked ass, And ontop of that it gets worse. 

Our second to last night of our trip me and my friend decided to walk to the playground at night to cool off and to get away from my mom after her trying to instigate an argument. About a few minutes in of us talking and just chilling at the playground a group of guys that was around 18-23 years old approached us. They kinda just budded Into our conversation, At first we went along with it because they kinda seemed chill and funny intill they all circled around me and my friend and started demanding us to suck their dicks. Me and My friend started to get extremely uncomfortable as they continuesly yelled stuff like "" Suck our dicks!"" ""Bitch suck my dick now"" ""dumb bitches suck our cocks"" ""You want my Dick!"". 

Me and My friend was trying to walk away and go back to camp but they kept following us and cutting us off. We tried to hide in the pirate ship in the playground but they found us and blocked the exit as one of them pissed on me a little as they called us names. We just ketp trying to walk away but they continued to harass us. And then my little brother (11 years old) comes out and joins in and makes fun of us along with them. At that point me and my friend ran back to my mom at camp furious. 

After explaining the whole situation to my mom instead of her helping us she blames it all on me and said ""They could've stuck a needle into your brother and took him! Something could've happened to him because of you!!"".(we could've been ra*ed mom but thx for caring>_>)After saying that she kicked us out of camp so we had to go back to the playground and wait till she went to sleep to have been able to go back to camp to sleep. And top it off all that we almost got into a car wreck due to my mother and bf fighting over the wheel on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge :)

It was a pretty shitty vacation."
"I'm actually so tired of this, my dad is terrible and my mom makes up new situations to make my dad to be in the right and for me to get in trouble, also they physically hit me all the time, my dad once gave my baby brother bruises, so how to run away, I'd rather commit suicide tbh, so how to do that to?"
"16f, this isnt my main account since i dont have my phone but yesterday was my boyfriends birthday and at 8pm i went to dinner with him and his family. my mom wasnt home when i left but i texted her an told her where i would be and why. when i got home she was trying to start an arguement about it but i ignored it and went to my room to sleep i got home at 10:30 which is usually the latest im allowed home but i didnt think it was a serious problem since i was with his parents and not alone roaming the streets. the next morning (today) i went downstairs to feed my cat and wash dishes (im the only one who cleans) it was maybe like 3 plates and a few cups an she yells an says why i hadnt done them last night and i ignored her bc i knew she just wanted to argue so i sat down away from her in my living room so she wouldnt be close to me, she kept asking so i said the trash was full and i was waiting for my brother 20m to take it out (his only job in the house). she then said that i couldve still done it but that i was being selfish an that she knows i lie about where i go everyday (my job/ non profits im in) and i continued to ignore her then she said that she will get me deported for being a bad kid and i said that my greencard just expired so its gonna happen anyway and she kept yelling and saying she couldnt wait to send me there an i said im still waiting (shes been saying this for years) she said i was talking back and started hitting me (im 5'4 115 lbs and shes 5'7 roughly 170-80 lbs"" i was sitting down and shes on top of me hitting me since she is stronger than me i was trying my best to push her off but barely could and she kept hitting me for around ten minutes then she grabbed my phone (i pay for) and started slamming it then went to the kitchen to put it under the sink, i was angry at this point so i threw this candle in a glass container (i was in livving room she was in kitchen so it could not even be close to hitting her)  she started yelling and breaking my phone with a hammer. she told me that she no longer considers herself my mom and to leave so i started packing all my stuff and texted my bf on my computer(he wakes up late so he still hasnt seen it) im really hoping his mom lets me stay because i have no one else. she contiued to yell around the house and started lying telling ppl that i was ontop of her and hit her when she knowsim barely capable of that, she lied and said i threw the candle at her and that i was haunted by the devil. my room doesnt have a lock so i put my dresser in front of my door until hopefully my bf can pick me up. Another thing was that i use my bfs cashapp acc that he doesnt use bc mine wasnt verified and his mom verifried that one (she knows i use it) and it was in my phone case so my mom started saying that she wonders who i stole it from an that shes going to the cops with it and that shes gonna figure out who ive been stealing all the money i have from (i get it from my job) which obviously she knows but was being delusional she also starte calling me a delinquent and a whore/prostitute. right now im in my room waiting for a response from my bf i really cant take this anymore i just wanna leave already i dont know what to do i just wish i had a mom who loved me . i just wanted to vent since i have no one to talk to and the only person i can contact though my computer is my bf. also important to note that my sister 22f has gone through a similiar thing with her in december 2022 and now doesnt live with us. does anyone have an advice i just wanna feel better "
"My parents are kind of people who use fists to keep their child quiet. I can go on and on about the things they did to me. But rn, i want advice for what just happened. My dad got angry at me for not turning off the lights so he came over beat me with a bat and then tore my books for which I have an exam tommorow. They will forcefully send me to scl tommorow while they have already tore my books and will beat me up so badly if I don't go. Sometimes I just want to run away from here but I can't. I really cant live here anymore"
"Ever since I (24f) got older my parents have progressively gotten more abusive, more my mom than my dad. My mom has hit me, thrown things at me and has called me worthless. My dad has told me to off myself and has now been weird with me and has made odd sexual remarks. 

Last month, they have installed security cameras. And just recently my dad has installed a double deadlock. I am worried for my safety since the only way to leave the house is to unlock it with the one key. My fear is they might take the one key and prevent me from leaving if I feel like im in danger. 

Is there any precautions I can take to protect myself if anything were to happen? I can't move out because I'm not finically stable yet. "
"This is for a friend, and I don’t know what else to suggest to her so I thought I’d share here.

My friend recently moved in with her father overseas, and always loved him very much. They’ve always had a great relationship, but now that she’s 19 she realized it’s too much.

He claims she’s unhealthy, and won’t let her make her own breakfast. He gives her food she doesn’t like, to the point where she threw it up in front of him.

He takes her laptop and phone away at a certain time, and tells her to go to sleep for her own good.

He will get jealous if she talks to her friends or her mom for too long, because she should be spending time with him.

Let’s not even mention she can’t stay out past 11pm, make decisions about college, or wear what she wants without him saying it’s too revealing.

How can I help her and get it through her that this is abusive behavior? She sees something is not okay, but it hasn’t fully hit her yet."
"Hello i am 19 and i really need advice.since i was a child my mom would abuse me mentally and physically. She would constantly call me a cow, and keep making me feel bad about my age(at the ages from 7-13) she would always mention my weight,and compare me to my other cousins and how they are skinny.she would always be so abusive towards me and until this day i keep having flashback of myself getting hit for only wanting my mother to help me out on my school project.i still remember every single time she hit me. What pisses me out the most is that my siblings never got treated the same way as i did .she still hits me and i am the one that gets abused physically and mentally between my siblings but now she would hit for being depressed,not wanting to tell her whats going on with me and for not cleaning the house properly while being depressed ,and now she just hit me cause i have been sick and couldnt get up and clean i really dont know what to do i am so sick of getting slapped.
"
"So I (22f) have been abused by my mum pretty much as long as I can remember. Mostly neglect and emotional abuse but I have been hit by her before (luckily not for a few years). And she’s a massive hoarder that refuses any help (and she’s been offered a lot) I can’t afford currently to move out and don’t have family I could move in with. I am working on it but I never got taught any skills required in adulthood (or in general tbh) by her and everything I’ve learnt outside off school I taught myself, so it’s probably taking me longer to be able to move out. Plus I want to know for sure once I move out I don’t have to go back. 

Problem is of course is that it is getting increasingly hard to cope with, especially as I’ve gotten older and I’ve realised more how badly I’ve been treated, and how stuff that id consider an unobtainable luxury currently (having a fridge and an oven, not having to shower at the gym, having a clean-ish comfortable space) is just normal for the majority of people and not something they’d even think about. 

As I’ve gotten older I’ve become quite conflicted, on one side I recognise that my mum was abused by my dad quite badly, and that she’s got mental and physical health conditions that’d make it harder for her to do certain things but on the other side I know how much help she’d been offered but had refused in the past, and I know how easy it is to do some of the stuff she just never does. And the fact that she acts like she’s done everything for me but like I have barely any skills? The few skills I have I taught myself and when she talks about how she should’ve aborted me or put me up for adoption all I can think is “yeah you should’ve you’re the last person who should be a parent”.

How do I keep calm while I plan my slow escape? Both for my own sanity and to prevent the emotional abuse from getting worse because the second I get mildly annoyed by anything I get insulted and belittled so badly. "
"Im 23 (F) and I have been suffering from financial, verbal, and emotional abuse for the past 4 months and I dont think I can take it anymore. My life got turned upsidedown overnight and I was not prepared (financially, emotionally, or in anyway). I spent the next 4 months clawing out of this dark hole and the first step of gaining my freedom was to get a hold of my finances once more. After job searching for 4 months, I finally landed a job!! Heres where my dilemma comes in.

My parents know that the only hold they have over me is finances. Therefore, while they did allow me to find a job to support myself, they limited my job search to Niagara Falls (which is where they live). They did not want me to find a job in Toronto (which Is where i was prior to coming home - finishing up my first year of medical school), because they know that finding a job far away meant that they wouldnt be able to control me anymore.

I have to preface that I do not have any siblings or extended family, and I have exhausted my friends for the past 4 months with my issues + they cannot support me financially because they are also all broke medical students with their own issues.

When I finally landed a job, I realized it was in Toronto and i knew that they would not let me attend my first day. (They made it very clear that if I go against their wishes, that I am no longer welcome in the home- and that I am on thin ice with them). I really dont want to end up homeless, and while finding a job in the city that I want is promising, I do not have the immediate finances to allow me to move there now + im too scared to initiate my no contact.

My problem is that this job starts in 2 days... and I am scared to go. Its in toronto (which is almost 2 hours away), and my family is crazy. I thought about telling them that I landed a job in niagara so that they allow me to leave the house, but knowing them, they might choose to show up to my pretend job in niagara (whereever I tell them it is), and demand to see me immediately. The danger here is that the only way for me to attend my job in 2 days is if I lie and say that I am going to work a job in NF, because there is no way I can reason with them, but if they catch me in this lie, then I am officially homeless. I want to leave, dont get me wrong, but I want to arrange my ducks in a row (so to speak) before I leave. I need to ensure my financial and housing situation, and I really need this to work out.

I thought of contacting another job that I got in Niagara a while back but stepped down from for the Mississauga, and ask them to vouch for me in case my parents decide to show up.... but I think thats crazy ( I didnt do it I just thought about it) + they probably would not want to be involved in my situation anyway.

So my question is: how do I attend my first day on the job on monday without them knowing where I work... and how do I convince them that I am working in Niagara so they leave me alone? Is there a service I can call to help me properly arrange my escape plan? is there a smarter way of going about this that doesnt involve risking homelessness? there is not enough reasoning in the world that I can use to try to get to them. They are dead set on ""only working in NF or get out."" Any advice is appreciated (please be kind to me Im very emotionally fragile)."
"I have spent years questioning why me? Why are they screaming at me and abusing me even more than they did with my brothers (God bless them, it is just that the difference is huge and weird) ? What did I do wrong? 
I am the polite one who listen and smile and don't insulte them nor scream, so why? 
I had several ideas about the reason those last years 
But I think that's it, I am their punching bag 
My mom screaming at me yesterday morning and not talking for the 2 days and now when my brother did it, she is coming to me.
"
"i (F15) am finally realizing that my mom may be abusive but im not sure and i could just be dramatic. for one im black and ik black parents discipline their kids differently, but if im a parent in the future im sure id take the more gentle parenting approach 

she would say “i brought you into this world and i can take you out” when i was young, like 9. she would hit me pretty often when i was around that age as well + yelling that im too used to to the point i dont even remember

i would wear diapers until i was 10 because of bed wetting (unsure why) and i was like 9 or 8 and forgot to throw it away once (i think??)  and left it on the bathroom floor, maybe i was in a rush and she shoved me on the floor and made me put my face in it like a dog

gave me a black eye once in the morning before school cause of something to do with my laundry. forgot what it was 

would destroy my ipad for being on it all the time. which is understandable i guess, but my stepfather would always be at work (plus i didnt like him), and my mom would always be sleeping, too tired to spend time or working, and i didnt really have friends.. so i spent my time on my ipad. (Which wasnt all wasted. i loved looking at animation and art which is what i like to do) my stepfather is/was also a horrible person and i spent like years begging her to leave him even though she always agreed cause she didnt like him either but we stayed for 10 fucking years. caused me alot of unnecessary trauma and stress cause they would always physically fight and i was young and didnt want anyone to get hurt so id try to put myself inbetween them

says im selfish but im just neurodivergent and clinically depressed. like for example sometimes she’ll tell me to turn the tv on for my baby sister and i do but walk away and forget to turn up the volume to go back to what i was doing. this is because i have adhd and kind of have trouble following directions or doing them correctly. if she said “turn on the tv and turn up the volume” id do it cause thats what she ordered but since im kind of on airplane mode i just take it literally and do exactly that. hard to explain but i dont do it on purpose- and she’ll yell at me and call me selfish for not helping her clean the house when its literally a executive dysfunction nightmare and i can barely find the energy or physical strength (i feel weak most days) to clean my room or bathroom. and i know to her it looks like im sitting on the couch all day in my phone but im not and my mind is constantly thinking about how to get better and other things like that- but its rlly annoying because if she did research on adhd and my condition she’d understand but she never does and judges me like im completely mentally fine when my psychologist had to warn her that i had plans of suicide at one point.

feel like i dont really want to talk to her or anything to do with her. when i had thoughts of suicide i put off telling her for months and she had to hear it from my school counselor just cause subconsciously i have a fear of telling her anything. i just.. hate telling her stuff.

called me obese for the first time (under 200 pounds at the time, im 5’8) a while after i told her about my weight insecurities and thats why i dont like telling her things

one morning she saw i had took a poop in the toilet and it wouldnt flush, so she got mad and plunged it but spilt poop water everywhere. she started beating me and made me fall into the water, and then cause i think i forgot to wipe my hands after cleaning something when i cleaned my bathroom that day she hit me again. think i was maybe 12 or 13?

when my grades were slipping and i had to get them up she made me sit in my room and do my work all day (understandable cause i had alot of missing work) and my adhd adhd’d (though we didnt know it at the time) and i couldnt focus so i wanted to take a break so i went onto youtube for second (i think i was in 7th grade) but she came in and saw it and started beating me, she was 9 months pregnant at the time and started saying if she went into labor cause of me its my fault

says i have nothing to be depressed about, and that im a spoiled brat cause we live better than most people and i act like a victim

she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and says my disabilities are no excuse and that im soft for being depressed all the time cause she went through it too her whole life (she doesnt have a adhd diagnosis) but shes like literally twice my age 

expresses regret for having me and my two year old sister when she gets mad sometimes

calls me the b word and a narcissist, and says “f you” , calls me a slob and a bum and also dumb and slow cause my neurodivergent brain has trouble registering sometimes

says i always whine about my disabilities when i rarely ever bring them up (once again I hate telling her things), and jokingly said she would take away my adhd meds which was kind of weird. says my disabilities dont “define me” when im struggling which makes me so mad because she doesn’t understand at all

also doesnt really take my mental health all that seriously clearly, but going back to the weight- im trying to lose it but she keeps buying snacks despite knowing about my binging and just says “excercise and burn calories” but thats not how i work with my urges, and then later gets angry at me for eating alot of the food and shames me for my habits, saying im a “user” and im like a bottomless pit. she’ll also be empathetic ab my disabilities one moment and then shame me for them the next when she gets angry.

oh and also acts like i cant have mood swings. not diagnosed but i was recommended for bipolar when i got diagnosed for adhd (were waiting for the appointment.) whenever i have them which is most likely cause of the depression (and im a teenager???) if were going off of diagnosis, she’ll get really mad as well despite her literally always having an attitude. I remember when i was obviously dissociating at the dinner table and she was just badgering me with the usual shaming and telling me that i was a narcissist cause i had a blank look on my face when i was really just.. not all there at the moment and not in the mood. just insensitive to me in general, like she’ll sing to the top of my lungs in the house but i feel like i can’t tell her to stop despite it hurting my ears and getting overstimulated, or she’ll say “i can touch you if i want” when i dont want to be touched or im feeling overstimulated or angry and then jokingly berating me for it and saying “i dont love her anymore” and i used to be so sweet

shes rlly odd with her parenting and blames me for not knowing how to do things… despite not teaching me them. for example she blames me for not knowing how to do my hair when she did it for me growing up and says “why dont you look on YouTube and learn how to do your hair” but i dont have any interest in it. i dont know why she expects me to one day just be interested in learning how to do my hair which i admit is maybe a little spoiled but i dont know what else to say. or how she blames me for not getting into the kitchen and learning how to cook but once again its something she did for me growing up so im not gonna randomly one day be interested in it unless she forces me into the kitchen like.. an actual parent. i told her this because i may not be motivated all the time and she just got mad and said “so you want me to be violent is that it” .. ok. she even jokingly said “tell her to let me do her hair mom” to my grandma and my grandma just side eyed her lol

she also makes fun of me alot which is maybe me being sensitive but it hurts cause she’ll jokingly compare me to my baby sister and say she’s more interested in cleaning and helping her than me and stuff like that. tells me she doesnt know how i think anyone can love me if i dont love myself and im stupid for wanting a relationship (not something i crave but just a human want i mention sometimes) and on the topic of me being suicidal she said to just go ahead and keel over (die) then 

im kind of counting down the days i can get out of her house and even look forward to going to college far far away. but i feel a little dramatic or spoiled because i know its probably not THAT bad despite all of this like this only happens sometimes, atleast now. she mostly just screams and yells at me but she doesnt rlly hit me anymore. and i know this list is just the bad but i mean shes a good mom for a good amount of the time to me and my sister most of the times and she says im her best friend, and we do happen to be really close with the fun stuff. but i do wish i could run away sometimes

i dont know. everyone else that isnt in my house says im a really sweet girl and i try to help everyone but sometimes i wonder if im a bad person. maybe i am. and i want to try to fix it. it does make me happy to help people, for example i used to help my ex boyfriend with his panic attacks and comfort him, and how i stayed up late to help my friend who was going through spiritual psychosis and she said i saved her life, or even how my friend thought his friend committed suicide at the time and i spent most of the afternoon helping him feel better and he said it worked, but i guess i should do more… and maybe even if i am selfish the reason i do it is to feel better about myself i guess. i dont know im really tired"
"Just thinking here after my dad tried to guilt trip me a couple of nights ago… he mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically hurts me but pretends he’s just playing around. It makes me sick to my stomach to think I’ll have to come back from college and live with him once I graduate. I don’t have enough money to live on my own yet. 

I’m wondering if I could get away from him by checking myself into a mental hospital… I never hear good things about it but if it’s to get away from him, I want to keep my options open"
"Trigger Warning: Mentions of Abuse/Physical Violence.

Maybe this will help someone: A letter to my inner child.



I think for me, the saddest truth that set me free was that deep down there was always going to be a part of my father that wouldn’t/couldn’t like me. Because he didn’t like himself. And that that has/had nothing to do with me.



I think there was a part of me that loved my dad when I was a kid. But there was a part of me from a young age that always felt mildly uncomfortable around him. Like I always knew that there was something wrong. There were a lot of demons he faced, and this has been shown in multiple physical cases that occurred throughout his life. (He beat the shit out of his first wife because he caught her cheating).



Also, I do believe that there is a high chance he was sexually abused. From my deepest inner knowledge, my father didn’t molest me, but there was always something “off” about my dad.



I also believe that my father was made to believe that he was worthless and or stupid at a very young age/throughout his life.



I also believe that my father did indeed, do a lot of stupid and somewhat morally indecent and nasty shit.

My father has, and always will have a nasty violent streak to him. That had nothing to do with me.

My father is and was a physically abusive man with a Christian spirit. The true definition of Dr.Jeykll and Mr. Hyde.



There is a sick (or hopeful) side of me, that is (wants to be) grateful that he tried. While I also know that that was unacceptable and not good enough. I was always good enough. I was deserving of a love that I did not get. I’m grateful to have found a way to give it to myself.



I never deserved who he was and any of the things he did and said. His actions were the reflections of his own extremely diminished sense of self-worth. My father has a Christian smile and demeanor that is responsible for deeply hiding the bruises that he’s left on the hearts as well as the bodies of several different women, myself included. 



My father has issues with women, and that will never have anything to do with me.



I also believe that he went through other horrific, violent hardships that his neuro-divergent young-minded soul had no chance of fighting against.



Therapy wasn’t a thing for Black people in the 50s-70s. And that also was a huge era of crack/coke usage. And being from the projects, I’m sure my father was lucky to get food on most days.

I have to hug my inner child and tell her that these are not excuses, but these are facts. And that she can’t argue with them. 



I also tell her the truth, that he will never fully be able to love her. And that this is not, never was, and never will be her fault.



She deserved worlds better.



But her parents were two somewhat broken abused and deeply traumatized people, joined together in a codependent relationship with Christ, who attracted each other, and due to religious judgment, probably felt that they couldn’t get a divorce.



 Even though my dad physically abused his first wife, and then my mother, And would later on go ahead to physically abuse me. (Their religion was incredibly strict about divorces/my grandfather was a deacon.)

Again, a fact. Not an excuse.



Also, when my father physically jumped on me, my mother protected him, and my grandmother protected him, because in their religion, black men, but more so fathers, “active fathers” at that, are seen as holding almost the same importance as God.



My grandmother would often piss me off by saying, “You don’t talk to your father because you hate him.” Or “It’s not like he molested you, did he molest you?” Which translated to me as, “Be grateful that your father didn’t molest you.” She would also tell me, “You have to excuse him, Deanna. He didn’t have a good father. He didn’t have a good upbringing.” And that sentence alone assisted in me suppressing years of anger and deep pain that I am grateful to have now dealt with, through therapy and time.



I love my grandmother dearly. I always have and I always will, but there was a part of my love for her that was dead for a very long time. I’m grateful that this love has been resurrected. She’ll be 99 years old in a few months, and she now has dementia.

I’m grateful to have deeply forgiven her, even if I have my days where forgiveness becomes a daily (or hourly) choice that I have to consciously decide to choose all over again.

She was a woman from the south who had a father who loved her. A husband who loved her. She was never going to be able to understand. She loved me. Maybe she thought I could protect myself because I fought him back that one Thanksgiving. I was a 14. Maybe a police report would have made my father look bad.



My mother blamed us both. Her words were, “You both embarrassed me in front of my mother.”

I was a child. My father was a 55-year-old, 5’10 350-lb man.



I’ve forgiven my mother. She’s been dead for six years.



Grief and acceptance, and the acceptance of immortal grief, with softness, rage, and beautiful sunrises and rainbows in between.



My inner child and I pray for peace for my father, and for my heart to continue to choose (in an act of self-love and in the spirit of deep healing and specialized self-compassion) the acceptance of facts. Forgiveness comes and goes, and that’s okay. I’m grateful that he is far away from us. We breathe easier now. We’ll forever have healing to do, and things to learn. Deep Introspection has become a friend to my loneliness. I’ve developed a deep level of self-compassion that for the longest time I didn’t realize existed.



That I didn’t know I deserved.



I continue to learn self-grace. I continue to learn self-love. I have CPTSD. I’m grateful for the level of healing and self-acceptance/understanding that I have developed because of that.



I am returning to myself. I’m grateful for the gift of solitude. I’m also grateful for Oui’d, and for my good-hearted cousin that sells it. I am grateful for love. I am grateful for strength. I am grateful for boundaries. I am grateful to have been given the knowledge, help, love, and divine assistance/guidance that has gotten me to where it is that I am today.



I am grateful for the force that has kept me mentally/emotionally sane (for the most part).

I’m grateful to be able to afford therapy. I’m grateful for medication.

I can breathe easier now. We know we (We as in me and little Deanna) deserve true, supportive, honest, and fun love from someone who will deeply love, care for, and cherish us. We know we do not deserve to ever settle. The man for us will be the one who will be fully invested in being a friend, a partner, and a lover.



He will be safe. He will also be the one to naturally allow the protection of love for myself I’ve fought insanely hard to build, accept, and hold on to.



It will be an honest joy, as I deeply know that it is already a joy. A joy that I deeply deserve. That I have always deserved. Until then, I am grateful to hold space in my heart for the creation of my own joy."
"This didn't happen to me or anyone I knew. But  If say, a mother hits a child repeatedly, and the child one day hits her back, is it allowed? Or is considered, morally wrong?

(I'll censor the parts that include violence just in case. It isn't *that* horrifyingly violent, just some hitting, and grabbing- and some threats.)  
  
So, let's say there's a girl named Susan. Susan is a thirteen year old girl, and her parents- most specifically her mom gives her a lot of academic stress, and would hit her a lot regarding it. Not when she gets a bad grade, but when she wasn't trying hard enough, or if she got a question wrong. She would >!throw whatever textbook (Not the big textbook, but the A4 ones with the thickness of maybe 250 pages) it was at her, or would hit her head with it. Sometimes, she would pull her shirt, and hit her head. Sometimes she would threaten her that she would kick her out. When she one time slack on her homework, she had thrown bags at her to she could ""Leave the house and die on the street""!<.   
  
Susan also had a brother and was fully convinced that the brother was the mother's favorite. She one day also told her that right now, he was more important and that he was way lovely and cuter. Most of the time, Susan defied her mother, and sometimes talked back. One day, her brother was constantly pestering her with weird, and somewhat >!perverted!<dances, and was kicking her despite her telling him to stop. So >!she hit her brother on the knee!<. Then the mother started telling her to stop, and walked towards her and raised her fist, telling her to don't hit her brother. She complained that her brother was keep pestering her, and that she had every right to hit him. On a regular basis, >!Susan also hit her brother- sometimes without or with reason as normal sibling do. !<  
  
Her mother told her that she had also seen her hit him without reason as well, and that Susan should just ignore him, because he was just joking around. Susan then told her that she had told him to stop multiple times before, and that he wouldn't stop. So the mother also told him that she would hit Susan when she hit her brother.  
  
 >!The mother than hit her, and Susan blocked it. She also tried to hit back, and gave a small kick- very, very little since it felt wrong!<. The mother exploded, and screamed at her about what a >!foul creature!< she was. >!""Are you a creature? Hitting your parent like that? There's kids on the news that kills their parents and hit them. You wanna go on the news?""!< Of course, this made no sense to her, because to her eyes, her mother was also a monster who hit her- was Child Abuse not on the news then? Susan then told her that she had every right to hit her brother when he kept pestering her even when she was telling him to constantly stop. 

After a while arguing about that, the mother than >!pulled her shirt once agian, and told her to ""get out of her house"", because she was ""scared that maybe Susan would kill her when she grew up"". She then asked Susan if she wanted to experience ""being beaten up so bad until the brink of death"", and that it was very possible for her. !< Susan was pushed to stand in front the front door, and took two bags out of a closet nearby. She threw it down at Susan's feet, and told her to pack winter and summer clothes so she could go outside and die. Susan by this point, knew that it would be hopeless, and promised to maybe hit her back when she was a little bit older, when she had more power. So she apologized, took a few threats, and went into her room. 

  
So based on this story, was Susan wrong for doing that, or was she defending herself?

(Thanks for reading my loooongggg post)"
"Throughout my entire childhood my mom has always beaten me. After I turned 18 she stopped. She never beat any of my siblings ever even though they had done worse stuff than I had. (the bad stuff I did was getting depressed and sh). This one time she beat me til my skin turned green and blue and I was bleeding on the floor. My sister used to clean me up after but she never said anything. Then after a few days my sister and my mom would ask me “you’re still not over that?”

My mom would often call me various slurs and tell me how bad I turned out and how horrible I am. Meanwhile, my dad was never fully present and he often went to go be with his other family most of the time. Whenever i would try to talk to him, he’d either yell at me or ignore me. I used to tell him about how bad my mom was treating me and he said “she’s your mother you can’t talk about her like that”. I don’t think I’ll be keeping in contact with them after I move out. "
"Till now I was just holding on because of my love for my mother (for context my father has been abusing me all my life and parents were separated but then mother insisted to get him back) Today I had enough and I just can’t pretend that I’m okay with everything when I’m clearly not. My mental health is in the gutter. Ever since my father came back I’m not able to sleep well, my eyes twitch because of taking too much stress, I don’t want to eat anything I don’t want to wake up or study anymore i just feel so pathetic all the time. Father broke my brother’s phone headphones photo frames etc day before yesterday cuz of a fight. Mother forgave him today morning. I’m just so tired of everything. I’ve been begging my mother all my life to divorce him but she always tells me that I’m overreacting. Today I was crying alone in my room, I never bothered anyone nor did I talk to anyone just in my own room then she barged in and saw me crying. She told me that even  if I become a drug addict or kill myself, nothing will make her divorce my father. I’ve never been so heartbroken. She called me melodramatic when I started crying. I was crying because my mama is the last person I’d expect this from. I’ve always considered her to be the only person who gets me, the only one who I can talk and relate to. I can’t talk to my best friend because she broke my trust, defended her brother who insulted and threatened me. I could only trust my one friend from school and told him everything. Turns out he’s been telling my personal stuff to his friends and laughing and making fun of me. This is why I only had trust in my mama, and she told me it wouldn’t matter even if I killed myself. I have no one who loves me, no one who truly cares about me, only one person and even she doesn’t love me. What do I do, I feel so lost. I can’t escape because my country doesn’t have cps and police doesn’t take domestic violence or especially violence against children seriously. Whenever I open up to my mother about my trauma she laughs and tells me that I’m dumb as I’ve never had any “trauma” and that I’m exaggerating stuff. My father has beat me for the most mundane things such as not being able to massage his feet properly. He has been mentally abusing me ever since I was 5 , he has told me to kill myself even suggesting ways to do so and my mother knows every bit of it. I only had her, and even she doesn’t like me.i wish I could talk to a therapist but my mother would never let me."
"So I’m so high and it’s late and I don’t wanna talk to anyone but I wanna have this. Back story, i my parents where assholes, my dad was just like an asshole x10, like I had to wrap a bandage around my stomach so my bruise wouldn’t show when I changed for PE, and my mom sucked too but this isn’t about her. I’m 21 in college about to go abroad, pretty successful as far as like good college, very involved, with a rly good internship and one lined up next year for on Wall Street, I swear I’m not tryna brag but like I think I did pretty good considering I slept in my car while applying to get into college. But anyway I have a like very odd, like I’ve convinced them our relationship is normal even though I legit go to therapy and have been(at one point in secret and with funding from my catholic high school, see they don’t just touch kids) seeing for years. I have like anxiety and relationship problems and like all that fun shit and like it’s directly related to them. Anyway I’m living at home this summer, and for like the 3rd time my dad and I got into it, he tries to do this shit were he acts like I’m still 12 and can’t fight back, but then he realizes I have like 4 inches and 20 pounds on him and if I wanted to I could brutally kill him so he just yells and this time he took away access to the car, I have to borrow his one for my internship bc I don’t have one, and threatened to throw me out and stop helping me, with the small but not insignificant (I got a good scholarship and the rest I’m just getting debt so he’s like paying for 15% or less which is still a lot bc holy fuck college is a scam). This rly fucked me up bc like I don’t have the car I used to sleep on when he would do this anddddd I’m like so close to becoming financially independent, like just 2 more years, I am a sophomore. But then like idc to explain but it ended with him being a weepy willow fuck and me just being mad asf and hurt. 

Ok big thing, while I was getting my shake shack from DoorDash at like 10pm on a night I decided I would get high as a kite. (I am high as fuck) my dad pulled me aside and apologized to me and cried and said he was hurt bc he hurt me and that his dad was shitty and he sorry for being a shitty dad. It made me realize idk if I’ll ever forgive em, like I’m so fucking sorry that ur actions hurt when u look back on them, like I legit did nothing and I hurt so much more, like that’s actually such bullshit, and like unfair and so so cruel. Like legit I need to use u like stop, like idk I’ve never wanted to like punch someone in the fucking throat bc they were crying apologizing to me, but like maybe now I may have been. like legitimately I’m so fucking mad and like hurt and upset, (and still high) like legit I was talking to my therapist this morning about not ending up like my dad and like how like I have to deal with 8 yrs ok the weekly (I volunteer at boys and girls club) and I’ve never fathomed of putting my hands on any of them, or even like the older kids, like seriously ur hurt cuz u hurt me, ppl said that u didn’t seem right (one of his employees said he didn’t seem right) bc ur actions caused u so much pain, Ive legit been going to therapy for years, so much shot but I’m so sorry ur hurt. I was fully expecting to be forgiving like I usually am but like this time I just got so fucking mad and I think it’s bc he said like all the wrong things and like idk. But ye this made me realize that in the grand scheme of things, don’t think I’ll ever forgive him, like he’ll be hurt as an old man, I was hurt as an 8 year old and I’ll always be hurt and have to  deal with that hurt, fuck you. No I do not forgive you."
my mom is so fucking pathetic im so sick of having to put up with my physically abusive dad bcs she doesnt want to leave him Even though he literally cheated and has a whole other family. im so sick of this
"I will choose to stay anonymous for this post in case a family member or someone I know finds this.

I'm currently 17(NB) and have been starting to break away from my parents and their control, and it feels AMAZING. They finally somewhat respect me, but only because of their selfish reasons...I choose to ignore it and continue on with my life.

When I was 12 I discovered I could express my gender in ways outside of what I was told I could! I was online a lot in elementary school but not to an unhealthy amount, I just really liked Minecraft. That evolved into being on TikTok and all that junk when I got to middle school. The influence of TikTok and the internet helped me realize I'm trans/nb. I came out as trans when I was 13. It is an understatement to say my parents hated me once I came out. I hung out with other trans/lgbt people, which my parents did not approve of at all. My parents didn't monitor my online activity so I easily got into things I wasn't supposed to.

They tried isolating me from my queer friends. They took away all my electronics, even my headphones for 6 months. This was devastating. I have autism, so removing everything that was comfortable, especially my headphones, was extremely detrimental to my mental health. I had to keep my door open except for when I was changing and sleeping and I wasn't allowed to see my friends outside of who my parents approved of (which was very little). I basically had no friends and was extremely depressed to the point I attempted suicide at 15.

My parents argued with me about being trans and how they ""wouldn't support this illogical thinking!!"" They were so desperate to control my life that they tried sending me to a christian high school. (Slight side tangent: I'm heavily into music and band. This high school did not have a band program. They knew this and wanted to put me into that school anyway. What were they thinking?) My dad once even told me he almost sent me to a MILITARY CAMP. I was 15. How could you say that to your teenage child?

I'm doing much better now. They claim to have done those things in the name of my wellbeing and protecting me from what they believe is bullshit. My parents are just hateful and completely unhinged, I truly don't understand their reasoning.

This was mostly just a vent/rant, but is there any logical reasoning to their actions? I don't understand.

(edit: grammar)"
"In this post, I will confess shameful, and also peculiar, aspects of my life, combined with actions that continue to haunt me. Before I do, however, I plead that all those reading attempt to sympathize with my upbringing first. Ultimately, I know that this also falls into my own hands and that I must first accept that before I can rid myself of years of self-inflicted harm. All I ask is that your judgment, which I am sure will follow, at least considers my reasons first, no matter how childish they may seem. 





Hello. For my privacy, I will not reveal my name, and it is worth noting to all those reading that this is most likely being posted through a burner account. I am posting this as not only a confession, but also as a means for gathering advice while I still can. To put it simply, I am turning 17 this year, but I believe my life is already ruined, and it is mostly due to my own actions.



When I was 11, my mom transferred me to an online school program based on my unpopularity at school. I was being bullied at school, and she felt it was necessary to enter me into an online school to combat this issue. At first, I went along with this decision, but a few weeks before starting, I swiftly began to change my mind. However, this did not deter her, and I found myself enrolled anyway. Prior to being an online school student, I would say I was an average student, and half of the time, I received good enough grades. This all changed when I was entered into the online academy that I am still, unfortunately, forced to attend. From the beginning, my family has offered little to no counselling when it comes to the work found within this program. As long as I do my work on time, and on time means in a period suitable enough to not have child protective services called on us, then they are pleased.



In the first few years of being enrolled, I, of course, happily took advantage of this. Instead of learning or prioritizing my education, I instead spent all my time playing games or slacking off on my work. Soon enough, it got to the point where I would have hundreds of overdue assignments piled up against me by the end of every semester. When this time came, I would have no choice but to knock them all out in a timely fashion. Thus, I began to cheat, which is incredibly easy considering you can find entire unit answer keys just by googling one question online. 



In doing so, I soon became reliant on cheating. I had not enough time to learn the material, and my parents seldom wished to help me. If they did, they constantly complained or berated me for my stupidity. I know that this is also my fault, but I beg you all to see that I know this. Unfortunately, this is a notion that has only come to me in the past few years.



One might wonder, Where are your friends or peers? Well, that is another issue. My parents are “overprotective” and “over-domineering,” as one might find. It is also worth noting that they are both mentally ill. They do not show much interest in my future or career, yet they claim to only want the best for me by practically isolating me from the world. 

We are also living off flimsy disability checks, and struggling with transportation issues. I have not a single person I can call a friend outside of the digital world, and I now find myself struggling with social anxiety and depression. 



I would say about two years ago, I began to realize the gravity of my situation. It has gotten to the point where I have forgotten almost everything I learned in the years I spent in public school, and I continue to cheat on my online work. If I were to stop cheating after 6 years of relying on it, I am most certain my future would be ruined beyond repair. For subjects like English and history, I would eventually find my footing. However, for subjects like science, math, and other things.. I feel the years of education and experience I have missed are crucial to my work, and therefore I would fail miserably. 

I realize my mistake. I cannot stress this enough, I'm blinded by it. I would do anything to go back in time and reverse everything I’ve done in the past 6 years of my life. But, I do not possess a time machine, and I am soon to be an adult. I have cheated for the past 6 years of my life on most of my school work, yet I have no intelligence or experience to show for it. To the eyes of future employers, I am a well-educated individual, but I know now that I am nothing but a childish crook who has forgotten everything in math besides the most basic forms of addition. 



The worst of all, however, is that for years I have implored my family to let me go back to public school before it’s too late, to tutor me, or to find me a tutor. These pleas have been ignored time and time again, and in some cases, my family has even encouraged cheating, just to silence the teachers who threatened to call CPS. I have reached the point where it is too late. Years of vital knowledge and experience I do not possess, and I cannot simply start doing my work in certain subjects without possessing that very knowledge. How can I, a person who can barely remember their multiplication tables, do high school math and succeed? Keep in mind, that to make a living and receive decent enough job prospects in the future, one must possess a formidable school record. If there is one thing I can say for certain, I only have myself in this case. Once I am an adult, there will be no family to rely on when financial aid is needed. 



There is only one way, given my isolated situation, and that is that I must find it in myself to learn and succeed, outside of my online school. This is what has led me to make this post. I ask you all to give me advice on what to do, and I beg that this advice is suitable enough given my circumstances. I have access to a library, although not terribly often, but it works. But what books do you suggest I check out, readers? Keep in mind, I not only need years of knowledge, but also years of refreshment on knowledge I formerly possessed. I do not possess a job or a means of transportation at the moment, but I am actively attempting to solve that issue. In the past year of my life, I have slowly but surely built up a habit of reading classic literature and studying the books I read. This has been of great help to me, but this is not enough. For the next two years of my life, I need to relearn everything I have forgotten, and then promptly learn everything I have missed. When I have graduated, I absolutely need to get into college, and get the farthest away from my entire family as soon as possible.  



I have the internet, but what websites and apps do you suggest? What books, readers? Tell me everything. Pretend as if I am a caveman who needs to learn everything in two years in order to integrate himself into modern society. In truth, that is what I feel I am these days. 



I take responsibility for my actions, and the possibility that I am too late has dawned on me during many restless nights. However, I still have two years, and possibly more during college. Please, help me. There is no going back to public school, requesting the help of friends I do not possess, hiring a tutor, or escaping my family. This is all on me and me alone, but perhaps I can scrape by."
"As you can read by the title, my girlfriend is being mentally abused by her mother and wants to leave. But she doesn't want to call cps or anyone because she's afraid of being sent to her relatives. If she calls cps, and tells them thag she doesn't want to go to her relatives because she doesn't feel safe can she be moved to a foster home or anything else?"
"Father screams everyday. Broke brother’s phone, headphones and photo frames and had a very huge fight with him and my mother. I told my mother to divorce him and yet again she blames me for it and tells me that I’m overreacting. All of the time I’m concerned for my mother’s health as from the time asshole father came back to our house (he was kicked out  for 2 years) my mama has a hard time remembering stuff. She’s forgetting everything and has a weak heart. I wanna kill him so badly, if anything happens to my mother I will not hesitate to break his bones. How do I convince my mother to divorce him as she clearly doesn’t wanna hear anything I say because she thinks I’m too dramatic when in reality she’s the one being dumb as fuck"
"TW:mental abuse and drug use mentioned 
Hi, I'm finally able to go to a therapy session after my doctor recommended it. my parents are not happy, they don't believe me when I tell them I'm not just me. My step dad tells me I'm delusional and making things up. I've come to the realization we've been mentally abused ever since our birth dad died .I have three months before my therapy session and my parents have taken away some privileges because it. Well actually fuck it, my parents have let me smoke weed since I was 10 I'm 15 now (I realize now that this was bribery for everything they did to me) and now they took away that because therapists can drug test you at any given moment apparently. Also my mom keeps telling me the therapist only will tell me what I want to hear and doesn't care about me, I just want to be treated like a human being and the others want a chance to be able to front with my mom saying I'm acting weird. I wish I could find a way out but my older sister cut all ties with my mom and now my mom tells me that ""we get at eachothers throat but we'll always be there for each other"" and I think that's just a way to reel me in I geuss. Sorry for ranting but thanks for reading this and any advice would be really appreciated."

"**Help Needed: Dealing with My Mom's Unfair Punishments and Lying**

Hi everyone,

I’m in a difficult situation and need some advice. My mom often forces me to lie about things I haven't done. For example, if I poke my brother, she exaggerates and says I punched him or did something worse. When I deny these accusations, she screams at me and says she saw me do it, or accuses me of lying. If I continue to deny it, she hits me.

I'm also losing my allowance and my tablet because of this. It seems like no matter what I do, I'm punished more if I try to explain myself or refuse to agree with her version of events. I'm really confused and don’t know what to do. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help."
"I have an oppurtunity to leave my toxic mom and go stay with my godmother. But for some reason, I keep thinking about how much I’ll miss my sister and life here. But I just can’t stay here with my family situation. Is this feeling normal? "
"I've been with my boyfriend for around 3 years now and it's been apparent that they heavily abuse him. We're in a long distance relationship but I have met up with him one time in real life. Even before then I knew they hated him because he was gay while they were heavily Christian and wanted him to have a girlfriend. I did my best to protect him when I visited but their controlling behavior is something I've never seen before.

Many times they'd force him to spend time with girls around our age (17-19) and force him to try and get in relationships with them. And when he refused they'd get angry and take some belongings away. 

After my first visit they decided to not allow me to return or him to visit me unless I came out to my parents. So I did, which was hard, but then they changed the conditions to when I was 18, which I recently turned. Once again they changed it to once my bf moves out. As you can expect that's been really hard on us but we can work through it. It's only what happened recently that's broken our faith.

For some unknown reason his parents got upset, SO upset that they took all.his belongings away, EVERYTHING. This includes his phone too. They are doing everything they can to force him into being what they want that they are isolating him from me. 

Earlier today he got just his phone back and told me that his father forced him into a strip club, got him so drunk he was blacking out, and proceeded to force him to have sex with a stripper. Honestly when I heard it I was violent and angry, just at his father. My boyfriend has done everything he can constantly to appease their insane expectations and try to make peace but this. Just is too far. Ive already made plans to work my ass off until I can steadily give my boyfriend a place to live, somewhere away from them. But man. This is really hard to just experience, I love him so much and our relationship is one only seen in romance movies haha, there's that unbreakable bond but, his parents just constantly abusing him and breaking him down...

I just needed to vent this somewhere because I feel really useless and doing everything I can to find solutions or help."
"From another Reddit but I feel like I posted it on the wrong one

I have made several posts like this on Reddit so feel free to read some if you want further context

I (17f) have a mother who has recently turned to conservatism and Christianity. I came out to my mother multiple times over the past 2-3 years. I was met with acceptance and she even bought me pride merch and offered to take me to pride. We watched queer shows together she even told me she wanted to go to a drag show at one point. Now for the past year she has been telling me that I’m not gay and that I’m only saying I am for a sense of community. This started in argument about how she hated trans people, I told her she was being hateful and transphobic somehow I came out in the midst of everything. The next day she told me she doesn’t believe I’m lesbian and forced me to watch conservative YouTubers talk about how the left is wrong and too sensitive. Then a couple days later I told her that what she said was hurtful and it hurt my feelings. She said and I quote.

”(name) I know you, I know you better than you know yourself I’m right and you’re wrong”

this shocked me and didn’t make me feel any better. Months pass and this conversation topic pops up again this time with Christianity in the mix she shows me videos of “ex-queer” people turning to Jesus and saying they’re done lusting after people of the same sex or having homosexual tendencies. more recently she forced me to watch a Candace Owen’s video (conservative YouTuber) talk about how the drag show at the Olympics was a satanic ritual against Jesus (it was about a Greek god but ok) Afterwards she makes me go in my room close my door as talk to me about “the truth” she tells me being queer shouldn’t be my identity, ridicules me and gay sex (random?) she tells me she can’t save me when i die and says that my girlfriend can’t save me either. In the end i broke down and cried in her arms not out of safety but i truly broke down at that point this was me surrendering but not to her. Now every chance she gets she talks about Jesus and god and forced me to go to church and receive a prayer at the end of sermon which I told her multiple times I didn’t want to receive. She makes me listen to conservative Christian podcasts about how people left witchcraft and the lgbtq community to love jesus. And god forbid I look at my phone because she tells me to put it away and says it’s Satan trying to make me stray away from god. It’s truly suffocating and no one else in my household knows it. Luckily my parent are separated so I can stay at my dads house and far away from this. Seriously what do I do. I’ve been told my mothers behavior is abusive or even narcissist but I’m still unsure :,)"
"It’s currently 1am , I got off my 9 hour shift not to long ago to 
My dads always been an amazing dad growing up. even still now Id think he was the strongest person in the world, and I wouldn’t imagine a world without him, he’s been through so much same with my mom, but she knows I’ll handle it more. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot there’s countless stories I’ve heard that just blow my mind that a parent would that to their child. But anyways my mom and dad have always gotten drunk, and they would fight and it’s been happening since I was a child and so it’s pretty normal but lately my dad has been drinking so much lately cause he quit for a couple years and now the fights are horrible. I step in cause I just get so mad. ( i work 11 hours and then come home to them drunk cause they only drink at night) My dad is such a dick to everyone even us , and when my mom leave lately my dad says he’s gonna unalive his self. Which he’s been saying for a while now. But tonight. He got the gun. We all start screaming and he just throws it at me. (Doesn’t hit me at all or near me) he says we don’t care about him or that we take advantage of him and so much more stuff. And I know aloy of you guys will say we need to leave, but it’s so hard cause he’s the greatest person when he’s not drunk. He gets drunk atleast 2 times a week. I’m at home while my little sisters and brother and mom are at my older brothers house. And I just keep going in there to make sure he hasn’t done anything. Please if you have questions I’ll answer I need help. All my friends just don’t understand. "
"I don’t know if it’s considered abuse or something else, but my Mom is over 60yrs old, and I was a later in life child of her’s. Ever since I was little she would get into arguments or realize she was wrong about something and she will go completely mute. She stares off into space and will sometimes wring her hands or twirl her hair into a knot against her head, or bite her nails silently. It’s almost like her eyes get really big and glossed over and her lips turn dark pink/purple. She usually rocks back and forth when this happens too. Then out of nowhere she will shriek at the top of her lungs. It’s more like a roar, and she will try to pull out her hair and sometimes clench her fists and swing her arms around. She doesn’t usually speak any words. Occasionally she has screamed “run away” or “I can’t stop” while these fits happen.

The longest one was about forty five minutes and the short ones (they happen more frequently) are usually about ten minutes. Again, this only happens if she is in the wrong for something or makes an obvious mistake that she realizes after the fact. When she’s done with these fits, she has said she doesn’t remember anything except feeling very angry and she will laugh and call it “just blowing off some steam”… she has said she does not have full control of her body sometimes during the fits.

One time I had to call an ambulance because while she was having a fit, she was clearly having trouble breathing. It didn’t stop her from doing the entire fit though. They tried taking her vitals and one of them wasn’t compatible with life (I think it was blood pressure), so they wouldn’t leave until it came down because when they tried to get her to go to the hospital it got worse and she was fighting against the feeling of being sick during the fit too.

She has type 2 diabetes and it has only recently started to get controlled, after a fit that was more recent and her blood sugar was around 560ish. She refused to go the hospital for a while though and when she got there (about half an hour or so later) it was 530-540.

She had been having these fits since an instance where she was raped by my Dad in front of me. I was about five years old. I’m twenty eight right now. That is just from my own recollection. Her sisters said she did this as a kid/pre-teen too. Her behavior has always seemed erratic and extreme, and she can’t sit still ever. Her family has a history of severe mental health issues, and about three generations back all the women in her family were hospitalized and/or institutionalized at least twice.

My Mom sees a therapist who is very passive. She is nice but not exactly like a therapist and more like a friend. She says that her behavior is probably just a temporary thing she is going through, and in regards to the fits she just “has a lot on her plate right now”, but ONLY has generalized anxiety and depression.

I have ADHD (probably aspie too), anxiety/depression and PTSD. My Mom’s diagnosis has never made sense to me, or anyone. I know she tries to sugarcoat and lie to her doctors, but her therapist saw her have a fit once and actually initiated that an ambulance and police get sent to our house to help her from her end (it was a video call). What can I do? My Mom has likely suffered a ton, but she refuses to speak about things, and when she is frustrated she lashes out at me for her doctors not helping her. She is very keen on scapegoating me from a young age, and I’m aware of that part but I currently have no housing options outside of my parent’s house due to newer medical problems and occasionally my mental health issues still.

I don’t think I can get through to her but I am frightened about what she may have. I plan on going low and/or no contact with my parents once I leave but I’m afraid of having a child of my own and potentially passing down something genetic or being a carrier of something myself. Her older sister has a rare form of dementia induced from trauma or medication and she is almost exclusively non verbal and in a nursing home.

Does my Mom’s behavior match anything that would show up on a genetic test or something? Had anyone else witnessed behavior like that from someone? I don’t really know how to come to terms with all the things I’ve seen from her. Sorry for the long post. 🙏🏻"
"I thought majority of this stuff was normal
I’m 16 and I’ll go days without speaking to my dad because every conversation we have is an argument
I’m very unhappy at home but when I leave I feel like I’ve never been happier 
He never talks to me
Or sits down for a chat 
And when we do he calls me a bitch for a having feelings
I’m always anxious when he’s around because I’m scared I’ll do the wrong thing
Spending time with him makes me miserable 
And I have no escape because he’s always grounding me and I can’t leave
He’s super strict and won’t let me get a job
I don’t know what to do
They block my phone so I can't reach out to people I really need to talk to
They even put me in homeschool recently and now I really can't escape
I went from the best years of my life to just trying to survive
Everytime we have a ""disagreement"" and I try to say something he always threatens to make my life miserable 
My grandmother describes my living situation as a luxury prison
I tried getting my own job but he simply won't approve any place I wanna work
He didn't help me get a job at my gym
And when I got a job application for a coastal edge he quite literally told me to go fuck myself
And I can't work at a fast food place
He said he wants me to work at a place that'll give me ""financial experience"" and not just clicking at a cash register 
What fucking place like that is gonna hire a 16 year old homeschooled brown kid
In the mornings on weekdays I'll wake up super early but stay in my room for piece and quiet until I physically need to leave 
And on weekends I'll just sleep and stay in my room as long as possible o I can avoid him 
Im sad always until I leave the house or I have it all to myself 
I need money for sure because I know he's going to kick me out asap 
I already heard him talking about it
 he loves to remind me about how he pays for everything and im nothing without him when I can't even get a job because of him
I hate him so much
The shit he puts me and my stepmom through is insane 
One time we were going to go to Busch gardens but he was being such a dick to my stepmom who was stressed because of my new sister and my dad instead of trying to help just kept calling her mean and cranky
To which my stepmom replied that's why your own kid fucking hates you
So we gave the ticket to my girlfriend and we spent the day without him
Things like that happen all the time
Even on my 16th birthday dad was pissed because we weren't doing the things he wanted to do
So because the house wasn't getting along my stepmom sent me to my friends house for 2 days 
Simply because my dad was being a dick
Shit like this happens all the time but usually there's not an escape nor is there a birthday or a Busch gardens 
I miss when I was so exited to see him come home from work
Now I check the window everytime I hear a car door to make sure he's not home
I don't know what to do"
"I’m 15 living in the uk. I get good grades I don’t get into trouble and I listen to what my parents rules ( or at least they think I do lol ). I’ve never been to a birthday party, or a friend’s house or a sleepover. I’m not allowed to hang out with my friends, only occasionally I can play football or basketball with them for 1-2 hours ( I usually do other things during this time because fuck my parents). They also used to hit me ALOT for small things as a kid ( usually with an apple charger for some reason) but they have basically stopped. I actually spoke to my school counsellor about this once in a “ confidential meeting ” and cps came to my house. Nowadays, they don’t really hit me they just lock me inside the house for days on end for no reason at all. My mum may be one of the best manipulative person of all time, like to the point that it’s actually impressive. Things like believing I’m in the wrong in situations were she’s threatened to end her life if I don’t stop talking to my friends. She now acts like I’m her best friend and how I will help her so much when she’s old ( 🤣🤣🤣) as soon as I leave for university I’m never ever speaking to them again but I just want to know if I should forgive them one day lol."
"Long story short: my girlfriend was sexually abused by her own parents for years when she was a child. (After that she went to a foster parent when she was 9, so it's really f#&ked up.) When I found out, I was crying for, what feels like, hours. Later I tried to talk to her. I asked simple questions about how she feels about all of this after 10+ years. She gave me very avoidant answers and she said, she is fine and doesn't want to talk about it ever. – If she did, she would probably break down and be depressed for months if not years after it. Of course, after this, I respected her decision and didn't push the topic. I know, I can't 'fix' someone who doesn't want to get 'fixed', but is there any other way to help her other than blindly accepting that ""she is fine""? – As someone who's very close to her, I know she has some serious problems in her life and in our relationship too. That doesn't make her a bad person of course, but it seems like, she doesn't see any other options other than coping with avoidance."
"Escambia County, Florida has unveiled a horrific tale of parental betrayal that can only be described as a nightmare straight out of a horror film. Meet Christopher Turney, 40, a former deputy who was supposed to protect and serve, and his wife Leandra Turney, 39, who have turned their home into a house of horrors for their own children. These two are not just bad parents; they are monsters in human form!

Arrested on charges that are nothing short of gut-wrenching—child cruelty, child neglect, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor—Christopher and Leandra have reached new lows that should make any decent person’s blood boil. What makes it even more infuriating is that Christopher, once a deputy sworn to uphold the law, has now become a disgrace to the badge!

The nightmare began when deputies responded to a call at a church on Mobile Highway, where a brave child revealed the harrowing truth. This innocent victim had been subjected to physical abuse at the hands of Christopher, who allegedly unleashed punches to the face and choked the child until he gasped for breath. Let that sink in: a man who once wore a uniform designed to protect is now the very embodiment of terror in his own home!

But the abuse doesn’t stop there. This child hasn’t seen the inside of a classroom since being adopted in 2017. Instead of getting an education, he was forced to mow lawns and hand over his hard-earned cash to Christopher for groceries. What kind of sick individual exploits a child for their labor? It’s absolutely infuriating! These two have taken the concept of parenting and twisted it into a grotesque parody, treating their children like personal servants instead of nurturing them!

And as if that wasn’t enough to make your blood boil, deputies also spoke to another child of the Turneys, who claimed she was “homeschooled.” But her version of homeschooling is a complete sham! Working on assignments for just 1-2 hours a day under Leandra’s so-called “supervision” is an abomination! This poor girl didn’t even know what grade she was in and had never been evaluated by a licensed teacher. It’s a blatant violation of basic educational rights, and these two are getting away with it!

To top it all off, during interviews, deputies noticed the girl’s teeth—black with decay! When asked about her dental hygiene, she shamefully admitted she didn’t even have a toothbrush. And Christopher, in a shocking display of utter negligence, claimed he was “saving up money” to buy her one. Are you kidding me? This is a classic case of parental failure—a blatant disregard for a child’s well-being!

After their arrest, the Turneys were released from Escambia County Jail like it was a mere inconvenience, with Christopher walking out on a $17,000 bond and Leandra on $14,000. Picture them strutting out of jail as if they’ve just won the jackpot, completely oblivious to the outrage they’ve caused in their community!

Now, let’s take a moment to acknowledge the legal system’s favorite phrase: “innocent until proven guilty.” While it’s a cornerstone of justice, it’s frustrating to see it applied to a former cop who has betrayed the very principles he was sworn to uphold. While we must allow for due process, the allegations against the Turneys are so grave that it’s hard not to feel a wave of disgust at their actions. 

Their next court appearance is set for August 23, and it’s time for the justice system to step up and deliver a swift and harsh punishment to these heartless individuals. They need to face the consequences of their abhorrent actions and understand that no child should ever have to endure the kind of torment they inflicted!

In conclusion, Christopher and Leandra Turney are not just bad parents; they are a disgrace to humanity. We must demand justice for these innocent children and ensure that the Turneys are held accountable for their heinous actions. It’s time to raise our voices and say enough is enough!"
"I’m 33 years old but when I was 16 my parents had me legally kidnapped and sent to a troubled teen boarding school because I was “acting out.”

My dad had been physically and emotionally abusing me since I was 10 years old. He choked me out at 10 because of a D on my report card. At 16 he caught he smoking cigs and forced me to eat an entire pack with his own hands forcing them down my throat.

For some reason I still have a relationship with them and the abuse stopped when I met my now husband around 23 yo but now I fear for my sister and my nieces that my sister married someone just like our dad. 

At Christmas this last year my sister and brother in law got into an argument with my dad. When I didn’t take their side my BIL charged at me, threw a chair, and screamed within an inch of my face while flailing his arms telling me to get out of his house and I’m not welcome there. When I picked up my things and walked out he slammed the door behind me four times with his whole body weight. 

My dad said he doesn’t want to know what happened, my mom said to move on because “tensions are just high” and my sister and BIL have blocked me on the internet and won’t talk to me anymore.

I don’t understand how my family doesn’t see his behavior as wrong or abusive and now I’ve told them I won’t come home for Christmas and they are all fine with it.

I feel so unloved by my whole family. I sometimes don’t even want to exist anymore. 

Am I crazy or is his behavior abusive?

What does he do to my sister behind closed doors? What will he do to my nieces when they are teenagers? "
"Allow me to tell a very lengthy story.


Back in 2022, I lived with my parents like any normal kid. Until an incident happened. On November 7th, 2022, my step father slapped me across the face. After this had happened, my mother had called my grandparents, hoping to arrange a better living situation. She couldn't provide for me because she was in college, and she was getting a divorce with my stepfather.

This sudden change in my lifestyle had me incredibly angry. So, I took this anger out on myself and others, sadly. I blamed myself for my parents divorce. Anyone who said otherwise or slightly disagreed with me got hurt, either physicaly or emotionaly. This went on for the entirety of 2023. My grandparents realized this, and wanted me to get better. Therefore, on January 8th, 2024, they sent me to a residential.

I have recovered now, and have been for about 3 months. I am seeing a therapist every Tuesday. This is where my current problem starts.

Welcome to yesterday. A perfectly normal day for most. This is different. Me and my grandfather were about to leave to take me to therapy. My grandmother was not here, as she is a flight attendant. He asked me, ""What are you going to tell your therapist today?"" I replied by saying, ""listen, [grandfather's name.]"" That was all I got out before being interrupted by grandfather. He started going on about how, ""He is the adult here,"" and, ""I don't talk back to him.""

He pivoted the conversation back to therapy. ""Do you want me to sit in for the first fifteen minutes?!"" I replied with a yes, thinking it was an actual question. He repeated. I replied yes.

There, right there is when it happened. He pinned me against the wall, with me not being physical at all. He rubs this off later when we are in the car, forgetting all about what just happened, asking me what I did in Mario Kart today. I text my mother about what happened. She, rightfully so, is incredibly angry.

So, now comes today. I am confused, grandmother is home, everyone is arguing, and my grandfather has a totally different story of what happened, saying I got physical with HIM, and that's why he pinned me.


I want to live back with my mom. She isn't transphobic, doesn't watch Fox News 24/7, and is my mom, for goodness sake.


Please help."
"Tw: rant/ vent 

I just needed somewhere to get this off my chest immediately because I have no one else to tell. My father signed me up for a boxing gym a few months back and it has literally been my solace and place away from him. He has his own gym he goes to, I have mine. It makes me feel secure and responsible as if I'm learning how to manage my own time and just feel like an adult. It's amazing. Just now he called me telling me to get ready because we're going to the gym together and I initially suspected he meant his gym but no he signed up to go to mine. I instantly hung up the phone and broke down on the floor. Why does he torture me so much, why does he do this? He called me back more than three times and when I finally answered he called me a stupid cunt and a bitch. Words I never thought anyone could say to their daughter. I feel so sick to my stomach right now. I hate my father so much and I know people say ""family is forever"" but I cannot play this demented game with him forever. "
"I am very ill. I cannot get out of bed until past midday on many mornings and have made myself even more ill trying to force it. I have OCD along with various other undisclosed physical and mental conditions. Despite many doctors confirming that I am indeed, very ill, my parents constantly gaslight me, telling me I am making a decision not to be better and that it is simply in my head, that it is my fault I struggle, that if I just used every strategy they suggested to me constantly, that things would be better. I used to hate myself for not being able to do everything I 'should' though now I have been given psychological help, I am able to separate my own self image and internal state from my parents constant depictions of me as 'pathetic' and 'immature'. I have had water poured all over me and down my throat when I couldn't move; I was barely able to swallow it. I have been poked all over till I had bruises and dragged across the floor while paralyzed. My sibling is allowed to shove me and hit me and constantly shout 'shut-up' over me when I talk and they all constantly give me subtle reminders of how much of a failure I am and how much they hate me and how useless I am. They have complete control over me and demand to know my whereabouts and company at all times. My communication with outsiders is controlled and they are able to block all modes of technology allowing me to reach my friends whenever they feel like. I am only allowed to do my homework in certain places under supervision(I only got to write this because my mum is currently passive aggressively leaving the room whenever I enter one and everyone else is distracted currently) and if I try to play games on weekends they passive aggressively abuse me about my 'priorities', give me any housework task they can think of until I give up and do nothing except my homework or 'family time', if I play games anyway they will block my computer. Bear in mind I am 16 and this has been going on for at least four years(or since I began to develop away from them and they got spooked I wasn't going to end up their more docile mirror)."
"I’m a 16 (almost 17) yr girl and my mom is pretty toxic. She always calls me ugly, crazy, useless, retarded, idiot, stupid. These are the ones off the top of my head there’s prob more idk really. Well I’m very confrontational person who also has a very different mindset from hers so we are literally always fighting without any actual resolution. I’ve always told myself that I don’t want to anything like her ever but I am turning into her. I don’t call people names like she does, but I’m always trying to be right and spinning things to where she’s the bad guy even if she’s possibly right. It’s not even about resolutions anymore I just want to make her to see my point and conclude that I’m right because I feel like I am right. I hate her whenever we are fighting because I hate the way she says things and how she calls me useless even if it’s true. Anyways I want to be that type of person others feel comfortable talking too, I want to see their point of view and admit if their right."
"today had an argument with mom (48F). ive been crying a lot so I don't remember what is about anymore but she hit me for the first time in a long time, then tried to physically drag me out of the house while screaming at me to get out, threw my shoes outside, then threw them at me and pinched me. im shaken since my mom promised to stop hitting me in my early teen years and she hasnt done something like this for a long time. the worst part is that after, she told my younger brother (17M) how bad i was and how much of a pest i was and how she wanted to kill me and how her hitting me is my fault. he agrees that i deserve the abuse from her. im really shaken rn so sorry if im not making much sense. i dont have anyone to talk to abt this so this is why im on reddit. im just in shock/numb

EDIT: next day. My mom cried and apologized like she always does but I basically (for the first time ever) did not care at all. I feel so angry at my mom right now. I’ve never really gotten mad like this before after she hits me and stuff but how could anyone want to kill their own kid? How could anyone even want to hit them? What person chooses to have kids and then does that sort of thing "
"this just happened to me, my dad has always had super insane reactions like screaming bloody murder and calling me numerous names like shithead, cuntbag etc. when i mess up like breaking a plate or something. he kicked at me when i walked away because i said i was sorry and kind of walked away after. i dont know if this is normal because it doesnt seem normal but i wouldnt label it as abuse since he didnt hit me or anything so i just needed someone to clear it up for me. "
"you know when the little kid that lives inside you needs their mom, and because of that you spend years going back to yours because you haven't realised yet that you're actually desperate for your *idea* of a mom, not the one you ended up with?

is there a phrase for that, or at least a more concise way of explaining it?

I finally had that today, that I've been foolishly going back to mine when I needed her, because that little kid inside me hadn't figured it out. Every time it happens my brother has told me ""I don't know what you expected"" but like.. I expected my *mom*.. what I thought a mom was, anyway.. and now I finally understand I won't be able to get that.

it's been a painful lesson, and my heart's in pieces."
"So my dad kicked me out back in April because my ex made some lies. And when I got to my dad's I packed all of my things half of it, and got the next bus out of the city and went to stay with my mum. But my mum kicked me out because of my overdose. She was a nasty abusive drunk who always made lies about me trying to get me in trouble. But the past month my family been trying to contact me for me to move back in with my dad but I don't want nothing to do with him I dispise the man because he knew my ex physically, emotionally, sexually abused me and has stalked me and raped me. And arapently my dad regrets kicking me out and wants me back but I've got him on blocked on everything and want nothing to do with him. Am only 17 and staying in a homeless hostel and enjoying my life without my parents in my life "
"I ,fem minor, have a mom \[52\] who doesn't respect boundaries. she feels like she should be able to touch me when i dont want it just beause she's my mom. she lets my grandma and grandpa touch me too. it isn't sexual, but it's creepy because they touch my butt and i don't like it. when i told her, she got upset, or she'll pout. when i told them i wanted them to ask me before touching me, for kisses and hugs too because i was getting uncomfortable, she got mad. she says she should be able to because she's my mom. am i the wrong one for not wanting to be touhed by them? btw I visit my grandpa and grandma on Fridays so I'm scared when I don't give them a kiss or a hug they might get mad at me."
"I'm just writing this so that i can hopefully stop being so angry

tonight was really bad, and was honestly the kick in the teeth i needed to form a plan to move out of my mothers house. 

i have been 18 since may 2nd of this year, so not very long, and i have been living with my mother to try and get my live together since my abusive father refused to treat me as anything other than a maid without pay. i wasn't allowed to see doctors or anything of the sort.

tonight however was bad. i plan on calling cps, but my 7 year old sister was being verbally attacked by my mother. so i jumped in to try and calm everyone down and diffuse the situation. that was a very bad idea. instantly, my mother and grandmother started SCREAMING at me, and then my grandmas roommate jumped in too. all of them screaming at me, saying I'm acting like my father, calling me ""\[fathers name\] jr"" repeatedly with my grandma even acting like she was going to hit me almost. 

after this, i said i was leaving. and i meant it, though of course I'm going to form a plan beforehand. my grandma told me i should go sleep in a ditch, and that id never survive out in the real world on my own. 

i don't think i have enough words to properly explain how fucking angry i am. all i tried to do was help and i was verbally abused. i was screamed at by three grown ass women who then proceeded to follow me into my room to continue the harassment after i left. i cannot put into words how tired i am of being yelled at by an ex druggie (my mother) an ex convict (my grandmother) and a mooch (her roommate). i am tired of being the punching bag. and then my mother tried telling me that i ""triggered them"" because i was acting like my father. refusing to acknowledge that she was letting two elderly women verbally attack me and only focusing on how hurt she is. of course i wouldn't be harping on the drugs and being an ex con if they weren't abusive, terrible fucking people. I've even tried explaining to my mother that her behavior is abusive and she does NOT care (of course, why did i bother.) 

i really. really. do not like the people i live with. i feel very guilty for saying this because they're family or whatever, but there is nothing more exhausting than literally screaming at the top of your lungs and it falling on deaf ears and I'm sure people here will be able to understand that better than anyone else. and after all of this i was told to ""clean and sleep on my plans of moving out."" 

any tips for a plan to move out would be appreciated. i did not leave my my fathers just to be screamed at by elderly women who only know how to complain about others and bitch and whine when someone has a different opinion. i will NOT be attacked like this anymore. 

tldr: living situation BAD need advice on plans to get the hell out "
Title 
"Okay so I'm 13 and I have a (probably) abusive dad, but I just turned out so much different from my siblings and they all say it's my fault- who are 16 and 15 btw. 

I cant lie and say I was a good child, because I wasn't, I was good in school- excelling if you would, but at home I was problematic? Like I would talk back, not do stuff and I got beat for it and shit but because I acted out my siblings say it's my fault I got it worse even though I was a child(5-11 was when it was the worst) and they were older than me and didn't tell me what was wrong or right and let me get shit for it. 

Now I don't talk to my parents as much and they obviously aren't happy about it and expect me to just forgive and forget but I won't and as soon as I'm 18 I'm leaving but my siblings won't and they want to stay and help and they say I need to too and the beatings and yelling was all my fault

I don't think it was and I never really have, they were the adults and I was a stupid child but my sisters really have me contemplating it and I don't want to dwell and start believing them but I'm just so unsure it makes me feel sick that I could be the product of my own mistakes"
"Sometimes I find it hard to relate to some people's stories. My parents never withheld food or physically hurt me; which makes it difficult to explain the wrongness of it all.

Currently, I'm 19, my step-father was in the military leading to us moving to 3 places; before we moved I personally thought things were idyllic, my mom was a single mother but gave us a good life nonetheless. She enrolled my sister and me into an international school to provide us with experiences she wasn't given as a child and give us good memories; I obviously don't remember much of this because I was under 10. She constantly tells my sister and me about the school, experiences, and vacations she gave us at such a young age when something is brought up. Like it completely trumps everything we said.

She was formerly a social worker, meaning she saw extreme child neglect, abuse, etc. she uses these as a comparison to our experiences. Which isn't fair to the situation, it's hard to think she doesn't know this.

I might be all around the place when I talk about some of these experiences, bear with me, please.

My mother had us around friends frequently and one time her friend undressed in front of my sister and me because she had a mental breakdown, my mom put us back around her after a few months, she told us she had a moment and she was okay now.

When we first moved my stepdad was barely home, my mom was there but she wasn't very present if that makes sense, she was completing her master's while taking care of two kids. From 2-5th grade, I had to make my lunch or I had nothing at school, she never helped me but the food was there. Before this, she packed my lunch, daily. I wasn't given too much guidance so sometimes I packed it and other times I didn't; this led to me getting into really bad debt with the school, I was so ashamed that I hid the notes. Until, I joined an afterschool club, which allowed us to eat after the activity, I ate and they directly called my mother, she was upset and told me not to eat after school or she would leave me there, I didn't eat after school again. I did end up getting skinny and bony but, my mother would tell the doctors there was food and I ate all the time, and nothing else came of it. My sister had very poor grades during this time, she would always have bad grades in general, but she would punish her in very odd and cruel ways. She would make me spy on my sister and see if she wasn't doing her schoolwork, and when I reported back to her she would punish her. One time she called her downstairs and asked if she was doing her work, and when she lied she shoved her off of the chair, and broke it in the process; I don't remember anything about that event after that.

Middle school, I've moved again, and I'm a bit of a problematic student. I'm in a scholar's school, but because my home life is so bad my grades also suffer. I'm not a class clown or anything but if anyone was paying attention, something was off with me, I never got into fights either; I was just loud, angsty, but popular. I was in cheer, which was my only outlet other than school, I kept my grades just barely above being on probation because this was the only thing I had. But, my mother didn't like bad grades by any means, this meant I constantly had my phone taken, and other punishments. I wasn't a stupid kid, I just couldn't focus at home. I remember having a PowerPoint due, and I was on my computer trying to finish it, then my parents got into an argument (this wasn't out of the ordinary by any means) then she poured water all over his computer; he got up yelled at her and called her a few profanities then slammed the door leaving the house. All of the while I was at the dining room table, I looked up twice and went back to my work.

I guess someone noticed my behavior because one day I was called to the guidance counselor's office. She was kind, a little weird but she cared I would look forward to seeing her, and I'd tell her about my day and other things. One day my mother was gone for a work trip, and my stepfather was home, I hated being at home with him, he would drink all of the time, and he wasn't nice. He would always say, I'm not an alcoholic, they drink to get drunk, I don't get drunk. I was telling her about something and I went back to class, apparently something I said was of concern because she called CPS. When my mother and stepdad got wind of it they were furious, they told me if I wanted to leave so bad, I could go, and they would never see me again. They then told me to never talk to her again, or else. After that I hated her, I felt she had gotten me in trouble and I never spoke to her again. I was depressed after a while, I would never leave my room unless it was for food or maybe the bathroom; I told my stepdad I was depressed because I thought I could trust him. When I got home I realized he had told my mom. She was angry and told me that if I wanted to kill myself, do it. And she pulled out pills and a gun from the bedroom and told me to take my pick. I never confided in my family again. Years later I would get my answer as to why she did that, her ex-husband used to use suicide as a way to manipulate my mom and her immediate thought was that was what I was doing, that's why she did that ( her explanation). I hit myself in the head several times in anger causing myself to get a concussion, but I lied and told them I fell to cause it.

Years later and a bipolar diagnosis later, I've been in therapy. Several other things have happened but I just never thought about it, until sometimes when I'm just thinking it'll come to me. Moments without remembering and it appears out of nowhere. I tried to talk to my mother 3 days ago, about the lunch thing; I thought that wasn't very fair and kind of neglectful, she apologized and said she was in a loveless marriage and was going through things but apologized nonetheless. Fast forward to today, she calls me, upset. She and my stepdad are on the phone; she asks if I get a kick out of bringing up things from the past. Then she switches to I gave you food, shelter, and you never had to worry about the lights never turning on. Maybe you didn't have a bad enough childhood and now you're looking for stuff. I put you in the international school- most kids don't have that. Raising kids doesn't come with a handbook. And when I get upset at her just calling to argue I'm disrespectful. And if I was so horrible, why am I still here? Most people would cut off their parents.

It's moments like that where I can't even feel like I'm valid in anything, and I rarely find stories like mine."
"The thing is, there is a thing that makes me angry as hell. That this is when i see a childe get bitten by his parents.  I dont khow why but if i see a child is getting bitten up by his parents that make me so angry that suddenly make that make me want kill the parents. I hate those people who beat there kids. You should not beat your kids. Remember you decided to give bearth to a child. They don’t had any choise. They owes nothing to you. You owe them everything.

"Hey reddit! Recently, during a hospital stay, my mother came to the staff screaming that I was not to be let back in her house. She has abused me verbally, emotionally, and mentally my entire life, I don't know why she suddenly decided to kick me to the streets. So at 18, she left me homeless. I'm currently in a shelter, however, that won't be sustainable . 

I've applied everywhere I can think of, and haven't gotten anything from any of them. My current job as a Nanny isn't going to keep me afloat, and I'm here to ask for help. 

I'll leave my monetary apps at the end of this post. I'm just asking for any help that can be given, and you don't need to feel obligated to help, I get that the world is going to shit. But seriously, any little bit helps.

"Hi im 17 years old and going into my senior year of highschool. This year I'll be turning 18 in the fall meaning I'll finally be a legal adult but that is beside the point.

My mom was at church today and another parent from my little brothers tennis community heard my father cursing at my little brother calling him a piece of shit etc. Mind you my brother isn't a teenager nor is he a grown man he is eight. My father is verbally abusing an eight year old. 

This said parent told my mother that lots of the other parents are scared for my brothers mental wellbeing and want to speak to my father. But my mother, a victim of my father’s abuse pleaded with them not to as it’ll only make his behavior worse. 

This was kind of a wake up call for me. Like my brother is trapped, we are all trapped. Can I file a cps report online or wellness check up, that sort of thing? I don’t want to make any calls or have anything trace back to me. Idk. Advice?"
"29, F (ik, pathetic that I'm still not separated but what to do). I also don't live in the US (excuse my shitty English).

There's nothing of importance to talk about. I moved to another city when I was 17, wanted to have my own place until I'm 30, didn't quite work out. Early in my 20s I received inheritance from my granddad (whom I loved very much) but it wasn't formally arranged, just cash handed over. So, my parents took a hold of it and bought an appartment for me to stay -- and, of course, they became the official owners on papers because, according to them, I am too dumb to be trusted with property. Hence, I don't have any estate to my name.

Now they made my brother enroll in the university, which is in my city, and have provided him with an apartment too. It seems like the entire family wants to relocate here, and this thought genuinely terrifies me. Although they never hurt me physically and were willing to help financially (but I never accepted their help), the mental abuse was still strong.

Should I just abandon my apartment and move? I have some savings; not enough to buy property though. I have undiagnosed psychological issues but I still can work and rent, and be independent. "
"I am low key in danger, from the end of August on I won’t have a place to stay and I don’t have a job nor saving due to my mother being emotionally abusive she is as well financially. She controls me by controlling my money. I need to get out of this house or I will end up taking my own life and I want to continue living just without her. Please help me get the money for rent, deposit and some other expenses like travelling and food until I can get a job. 

Please help me. It’s urgent.

"My mom was abusive while I was growing up. I didn’t really realize that she was abusive until a few years ago; I knew that she abused me but not really that she was *abusive* if that makes sense. I thought that abusive parents were abusive 100% of the time but my mom would pretty much just constantly go back and forth between abuse and love-bombing. In the last few years she hasn’t been abusive anymore and still love-bombs. I’m 29 now and trying to fix myself. My mom is always wanting me to spend time with her and the rest of the family and I feel really bad about it but I am pretty uncomfortable around her and just don’t want to most of the time. She was the only one that was abusive to me, I would fight with my brother but we were kids and that was normal. I feel so bad for avoiding the rest of the family just because she’s there. I also feel bad that she’s the one I talk to the most. I guess I’m comfortable calling her on the phone, it does often worsen my mood but she answers the phone and I don’t really have anyone to talk to so I call her. I would like to go to therapy but I’ve been to so many and they were either useless, actively made things worse or moved away after a few sessions. I had to go to therapy growing up to but it wasn’t ever really for me, my mom would go sit next to me and do all the talking until I was 18 and able to go alone. Idk really even where I’m going with this, I guess maybe I’m just trying to vent but if anyone had any little bits of advice or can relate at all it would be nice. Thanks."
"hi everyone,

for context, i'm 21F and live in an arab muslim household. growing up my home life was always turbulent (my mother is a narcissist, my grandma is a complete asshole, my dad is emotionally unavailable and strict) but in recent months it's been kicked up a notch because they have a feeling that i'm converting out of shia islam (spoiler alert, i already became sunni, but i haven't blatantly said it).

it's been nothing but abuse for months. psychological, emotional, verbal, even technological; my dad has been tracking my call logs and threatening to harm my friends, and as a result i haven't spoken to anyone for a while. they forced me to drop my master's degree and pursue a post-bacc somewhere else bc they felt that the ppl i interacted with were the ones pulling me away from the religion i grew up with. they can't really fathom that i'm doing the research on my own and came to the decision myself.

  
my friend has offered to let me stay with her for as long as i need, but i feel like i'm imposing. i filed for domestic violence assistance from a nonprofit but they were no help and sounded like they didn't care about my situation at all. 

my only option is to find an apartment somewhere, but i barely have any money and my parents made me quit my full time job. i'm still waiting to hear back from part time jobs, but there's so many other things i haven't prepared yet. one major thing is that my car is under my dad's name, and i can't afford another car. is there any way i can go about fixing this without my dad knowing?

  
i'd just really appreciate some guidance. i'm tired of getting well wishes and prayers, i need to leave asap. i fear for my life and my quality of living has been so abysmal, i just want to feel some sense of purpose again."
"I can see out of my right eye and that eye is not as good and I have some developmental delays so my skills are not as good and I ate through a feeding tube because my body had trouble when I was little. So I cannot swallow well and I cannot throw up at all and I prefer the feeding tube But I will drink water by mouth. I was featured in a documentary called mystery diagnosis and the baby who changed colors, that's the episode name, second segment on there, and you can watch it on DaillyMotion. My name is Isabel and I am 19 years old and I am from Georgia. My ramily are narccassists and WAY too overprotective of me, when I tried to leave and called the police to back me up legally, it backfired! So now I have no phone and I am secretly using an internet browser on my Alexa Device, as my family believes everyone on the web is BAD. Hell, they even made me watch doccumentaries on sextual preditors, trying to screw me up! It did, but I refuse to show emotion and give them what they went. They at least allow me to read and watch tv, as they take me to the library, but STILL! I AM TREATED LIKE A CHILD! They even say I am mentally a chilf, making up excuses about my delays, true, but I also never had the chance to grow up! Never had sex, never went to collage, never had a job."
"He constantly finds ways to berate and nag them. He insists that they're weird and ""need to be fixed"". He regularly invades their personal space and bombards them with stimulation. He constantly demands they work more hours even when they work full time, setting impossible expectations. He makes payments with their card without asking. He frequents Fox News and rants about ""wokeness"". He's even occasionally attempted to take their phone and see who they're talking to for 5 years now. The rest of their family also deals with his mania and threats to some extent, but SO gets the significant brunt of it.

What's even worse is my SO suffers from severe OCD(suspected) which forces nonstop intrusive thoughts about death, time passing, and growing old, among other horrible things. It even emulates their dad's ramblings, overstimulating them and forcing them to dumb down their thoughts and... essentially succumb to insanity. Their dad just sees it as them being ""depressed"", and doubles down on the stimulation while refusing to let them pursue medication or counseling because, again... he frequents fox news. You figure that one out.

This has been going on a long time, and while the severity fades in and out, yesterday it reached a boiling point. Seeing the state SO is in now, I feel like I can't sit idly by anymore. I'm nearly in a position where I could get a place with them, even support them on my own income, but the problem is he's so deeply entrapped that it's hard to know what's the best way to extract him. Finances have been tight for the family especially with how he struggles to hold down a job, so it feels like there's this expectation that they need to stick around indefinitely and continue supporting the family with their modest income. So there's the potential concern that without SO the family may struggle further, or at least their dad could use that as leverage. He's made threats to divorce before, and there's fear among the rest of the family that he may do so, or perhaps disown SO, if there's significant pushback... but then again, he has yet to make a severe decision like that, and it seems it's only the threat of that that keeps the rest of the family in line. Plus he doesn't know about me yet, so they're worried that dropping the news could enrage him.

But still, it feels to me like SO and their family are kept in check by fear, when in reality there's surely something they can do to put him in his place and stop the insanity. I'm just not sure how to go about helping it happen without potentially setting him off in a bad way..."
I believe my mother has abused me sexually as a child and I think I ignored it and had forgotten about it trying not to think about it. The stuff I have been able to talk about with my therapist is how she would have sex in front of me with my dad. I love my mom but of course there is definitely mixed feelings. I am now 26 and fucked up in life. I’d like to talk about it with my therapist but don’t want my mom to be in trouble

"hi so im an international student at a UC university. I grew up pretty privileged tbh the only thing was my physically and verbally abusive mom and emotionally absent and egotistical father. essentially, I have been going though turmoil and I just completed my second year of university as a woman in STEM. My gpa is currently at a B- average which is not too bad but given that I was a straight A student, I am capable of doing really well. the issue is that my GPA is not good enough for my father and he is now refusing to send me back to university, mainly because the money is my grandparents from my trust fund and it hurts his ego to ask for the money because he believes it is his duty to support me. He is putting his ego before his daughter and I don't think I can ever forgive him for this. Even my mother believes in me, just not my father.

The issue is that I wish to take on student loans to complete my education and I'm not sure it is worth it? will it financially cripple me for the next 15 years? I believe in myself and I know i can do well on my own but are student loans worth the risk?"
I have been raised in a broken family with a lot of mental and physical issues. I have been beaten more than I can remember and sometimes it even left me with fractures but it is not the most traumatizing part but rather the incidents where I saw my father abusing and assaulting my sister and my nanny. Can someone please help how can I move on and get on with my life and live a normal life
"My mom was both physically and emotionally abusive towards me as far back as I can remember, until she threw me out of the house at 18.  She threw the newspaper at me and said that I had 3 days to get out.  I had no car, no money, and only a part-time job.  Since I had no car I asked her if she would take me to see a few places and she refused.  
We've never had a relationship since.  To her, I deserved the punishments, as she liked to call them, because to her I brought them on myself.  I am the black sheep of the family.  None of my siblings will speak up as to how she was. Anyways, I never moved back home and only rarely spoke to her. 
I just found out she had a second stroke from a family member.  I never knew she had a first stroke. The thing is, I don't feel sad or worried for her and I don't really care.   When I think about the fact she could die then I get sad but I wouldn't even go to her funeral if she were to die.  How can I not care about her yet be saddened that she might die?  She doesn't even know that I'm aware of her situation because, in her words, I'm dead to her.  Has anyone experienced something similar?  Is something wrong with me for not caring?  Am I just a cold person?"

"My parents beat me not extremely often but when they are upset with me. Yesterday my brother came into my room and scared me (crawling on all fours in the dark) so I screamed because thats a normal reaction to being shocked. It just so happened that it was around 5 (an hour before my parents had to get up and get ready for work). Because of the scream my mom woke up and got mad and told me I would be going to work with my dad since i wanted to ""keep people up"". I didnt want to go because its a VERY long boring day and they took my phone (which i barely ever even have). So basically once she realized I wasnt going no matter what she began beating me first with a wooden back scratcher and then an electrical fly swatter. I was also stripped naked before this because she was planning on ""force dressing me"" since i didnt want to go. So basically i was getting beat naked. Part of one of my braids was ripped out aswell.  My back had her hand print on it, and i couldnt fight back because i was trying to also cover my body with whatever i could. She slapped me multiple times. It was humiliating. I told her I didnt want to get dressed in the living room since it was uncomfortable, I even explained why I screamed and she didnt care. (My brothers punishment was to clean his room which he also did not do, she favors him over me and my other brother). This is not the first time my brother has done something and gotten away so easily this happens all the time. I am 16 and my friends are suggesting I come with them or call police but my parents tell me cps will just tear our family apart and that i will get adopted by rapists. My mom took all my money out my credit card, and my phone. I have no idea what to do.

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone who is giving me advice, I still do not have access to my phone but they havent hit me since. I am hoping they change because the next time this happens i will be moving in with my friend and her mom."
"I'm simply here with questions as I'm not so sure if i should stay in my current family.  
so  
1. since I've started life my mother has constantly said that I'd never get anywhere with my attitude, and that I'm lazy or how if i wasn't born she'd be doing much bigger things, constantly compares me to others and insults me and my father daily.  
(this happens at the slightest of thing. eg. if i forget to wash the dishes or some other chore)  
At the same time she says she does all that because she loves me and if i try to pull away from her emotionally and physically then she says I'm like the children who leave their parents and don't appreciate their efforts.

2. I was constantly beaten as a child, which i though was normal until another relative (who also participated in the beating) talked about how beating traumatizes the child.

3. My father didn't want anything to do with me when i was born. He has gotten better but i still doubt him.

4. Someone in the family tried to commit but no sympathy was given, instead the relative was insulted.

5. I live in a Christian family and I'm not comfortable with their view on others who aren't Christian(I'm an atheist somehow).

There are other matter but i would say these are the main issues. I can't say this hasn't impacted me as i don't wish to live anymore but I'm simply wondering if I'm just spoilt."
"this is a lifelong healing process and i need help. i am losing my mind processing this on my own. 

when i (29F) was a baby my dad molested my older sister who was 10 at the time. 

i didn’t grow up with him. but he would call every day and he would send money for child support. i thought he was okay but didn’t really understand his role in my life…

my mom told me what he did when i was about 10 years old but she wasn’t delicate about it in the slightest. my mom has a lot of mental issues and is a chaotic person mind you. she told me coldly with no emotion casually one afternoon. i was shocked and i cried. my sister was there too and she just kinda shrugged it off. i was so perplexed at how my sister and mom could be so casual about it and of course not offer any type of emotion to me, a 10 year old finding out her dad is a pedo. 

so that was traumatizing and fucked me up. my family never wanted to talk about it so i held it in. i even asked my mom to take me to therapy and she did take me to one session where i swiftly told the therapist wtf had happened, mind you i was 12!!!! but we never went back. WHY DID I HAVE TO PUSH FOR THERAPY FOR MYSELF AT AGE 12 

my mom always buried it and made it an after thought. she never liked to think about it. 

my dad would text and call often and i never ever replied for years and years. 

the only thing was that my dad lived with my grandma, he was her caretaker. i loved my grandma a lot. so when i was 23 i went back to his house to visit my grandma. 

then we didn’t speak again. 

my mom and my sister were very aware of my suffering. my sister, the victim, literally told me that it was in the past and that i should have a relationship with him if i wanted. same with my mom. my sister even empathized and said he probably was abused when he was a kid. 

then around 26 i moved to LA, and my dad told me my grandma was sick and maybe going to die soon. so i came to the hospital and his house. then we would get lunch and started talking. and that’s when i went into denial and compartmentalizing. i stored away the knowledge of that and wanted to get to know my dad for the first time. turns out we got along really well and we were really similar…
this is what i am so ashamed of. how could i have veered off path like this for a second and not have held the boundary? my grandma being sick was the catalyst. 

then i needed a couch to crash on and i crashed on his for 2 months. my grandma was sick and i was living in this delusion, or maybe not a delusion, just different side of my dad. i wanted to have a dad and we got along well. this was for about two months and again i am so ashamed of this even though my sister and mom were happy i was having a good relationship with him (…???) 

fast forward a year. i had long moved out. and i finally finally wrote my dad a text telling him i know what he did and that he’s dead to me, and i blocked him. 

but it seeps in. my mom speaks to him. she said she and my sister forgave him long ago, but he’s never apologized to me or acknowledged it. my mom and sister are obsessed with “not living in the past” aka denying any mention of past traumas. maybe repressing? my mom also told me he was very regretful and found the church after the incident, apologized to my mom and sister. but again none of this has been explained to me formally. i feel like offhanded doesn’t count…
my aunt (his sister) and i are close and i think she knows? and also doesn’t … acknowledge it? 

i have no idea if there have been other incidents but i get the vibe he’s pretty reformed especially since he became more and more his moms caretaker full time. but maybe that’s just wishful thinking. 

i seem to be the only one affected by it anymore. it’s like impossible to cut ties completely it feels like because he’s in the life of family members in my life. and idk who knows and who doesn’t and it fucked me up so badly to have to say i don’t get along w him and wonder that. it’s so so so so awkward?

aside from that, recently my grandma died. his mom. today was the funeral. my mom came down. i fixed myself to go, i loved my grandma. i tried to mentally prepare myself for weeks ahead to see him. no idea what i would do or what it would feel like. 

today the day came. i couldn’t sleep last night. nothing to do with my grandma, completely to do with the torture of my dads past actions. i cried the entire way to pick my mom from the hotel and i saw her and told her i’m not well and i better not go. she kind of understood but then she gave me a talk about the past defining us and i told her i’m not over this and she has to respect this (besides she hasn’t really been there for me. she either pushes it aside, tells me to get over it, or randomly decides to be upset about it in a very chaotic way. i would say AT me. not with me. and like i said my mom has problems of her own, none of which as grave as my dads, but she’s been verbally abusive probably has BPD and has often used “you’re crazy like your dad” as a deep jab at me during particularly heated moments.)

anyway. surprisingly my mom kind of respected me but we got to the funeral and i decided to give it a try. i saw my dad and we were in front of his mothers urn and it felt too awkward not to hug so i gave a light hug and he started sobbing into my shoulder (WTF!). it was so loaded. he’s never expressed emotion like this before it was so awkward and fucking weird 

then he tried to talk to me casually . how dare he????? then i fucking left and said i was sick. now i’m in my moms hotel room with a pounding headache after sobbing for a while. 

i’ve been in therapy for years about it and i’m still so lost. i feel gross and shameful for some reason. how could i have ever spoken to him again after i knew? how can i let ANYONE let him live in peace? am i an enabler? aside from that incident, i actually feel bad for him for the other circumstances of his life, being alone and estranged daughter. i actually felt bad for him crying in front of his mothers urn. even tho at the same time he FUCKING deserves it. i’m the first one to say k*ll r*p*sts etc. but when it’s your dad god does it fuck you up. how is this my dad ? ??? is it horrible that i still care for him a bit despite this? am i a pedo sympathizer ???? i have no idea how restorative processes work for these situations. i likely may never ever speak to him again. 

it fucks with my sense of self. i don’t know what to say. can someone help me process this fucked up clusterfuck of emotions? 

my friends say they are here for me. i’ve told a couple but i honestly i feel ashamed when i do. it’s exhausting and scary to disclose. . like they will look at me differently for feeling conflicted in some ways, or handling it differently than they would, or for not just closing the door forever …but it feels more complicated than that cuz it would feel like i’d have to close the door to our mutual family members?????

context. i’m from a latino family. it’s very emotionally incestuous and guilt trippy. a sort of “collectivism” i suppose. i definitely feel ostracized for not accepting the status quo 

i’m gonna continue living with my boundary but spiritually, how do i deal with this?how do i live with myself tbh? how have y’all dealt with this? why do i feel such a heavy shame??? i am gonna get therapy again but y’all know that’s a process. just … HELP :( i’m fucked up.

"Hey guys, just some general context about myself, I’m 25 yo living with my parents making my own money, have siblings and consider ourselves living decently (Lebanon and it’s financial crisis if you know). 

The thing is I have a small issue with my parents and how strict they are with me and potentially with my siblings (can’t judge since they’re much younger than me), but somehow somehow I get a rejection from my parents whenever I ask them that I want to go out with my friends, mainly from my mother, my father is chill about that but I still receive some words now and then. 
This shit been happening since I was in school, had to come back home at 6PM then or else my mom would start panicking, now they’re lenient more about it but at 1 AM I gotta be home at max (no I don’t do parties probably because it’s not my thing) and I also understand them checking up on me but it comes out from them aggressively. 
Every time I politely ask my parents that I wanna go out (most of you will say wtf this guy is 25 and still asks his parents to go out?? Yes I do because they’re my parents and I have to respect them), the answers I receive are ‘no need to go out, stay at home, tell them you can’t make it etc’
I consider myself an introvert because I’m not a very social person, my friends circle is very small and during my time at uni I made 0 friends and cutoff my contact with my school friends, which made me spend around 5 years at home isolated nobody to talk to, just as my mother thinks is right and normal. 
Every time I go out without the ‘ok’ from my mother which is always the case lol we stop talking and she starts to ignore me as if I’m not her son and as if I’m not living with them and everytime I have to back to her like a dog and apologize knowing that nothing is wrong about what I did. 
I have already explained to her eno I’m doing nothing wrong, my friends are good people but she disregards all of this, she just wants me to stay at home and do nothing. 

Moving out is not an option as I cannot buy a house. 

What do I do? It’s super affecting my behavior and it’s draining me from inside. "
"I, 19 fem no longer live with my family but my younger sister (13) still does.
We have been texting and she has been telling me about the things our father had been saying to her and I would like to hear your opinions if this is inappropriate because in my eyes his attitude and the things he is telling her is unacceptable.
My sister is vegan and already has mental issues such as depression and an ED which comes from her always taking blame on everything and thinking problems start because of her. I used to think this is just an unhealthy habit she had adapted but I’m starting to think it is my dad’s fault. She texted me a couple days ago telling me that he has been telling her that she spends too much money on herself and should be ashamed (he said this KNOWING about her medical history of therapy about taking too much blame on herself causing her to SH). 
For context, my family is currently on vacation in America. This is the only time she can buy things out of Europe and go to shops she had never been to (she is also a teenager who is interested in beauty and fashion). This might not seem too bad but this is not the only thing he has been saying. He has also been blaming financial struggles on her even though our family is well off. He has been telling her that he will throw away all her belongings so she stops spending time on herself and do all of the chores instead (she DOES to chores when asked and this is a teenager who wants to spend more alone time). He has been telling her she’s a waste of money and complains when she needs 10-20 bucks for one outing every month. She SAVES most of her money and only goes thrifting. She also is a vegetarian and cannot eat meet since when she tries she feels guilty and pukes it out. Our dad even then gets mad at her for not eating it and pressures her which makes her take blame. Therefore she then start refraining from eating anything thinking she isn’t worthy of the food and should starve herself.
She is in a terrible situation, I would like to know if I should force my father to have therapy since he is clearly not trying to improve.
Thank you for hearing me out I am sorry about my grammar English is not my first language."
"This just happened thirty minutes ago and I’m still shaking from the anxiety but here we go.

I (18-F) was left home alone with my dog after my (47-M) father went out with his friend. We had already had a fight earlier today about dumb stuff (I forgot to message him that I was having dinner with friends and tried apologizing but it did nothing) so I was pretty on edge and had a lot on my mind mentally. I ended up calling my friends before going to bed and accidentally locked my dog outside. When my dad got home, drunk btw, he was furious and stormed into my room and began to yell at me. Things continued to escalate until I cried but he didn’t stop and asked why I left her out. I said I was sorry I forgot and I just had a lot on my mind. I didn’t wanna tell him what was going on but he kept pushing and so I said I wanted to die. I thought maybe he’d calm a bit but he just told me I was exactly like my mother (who attempted years ago) and told me to do it. My own father told me to kms. He kept yelling about how terrible my friends have it compared to me and said that if I brought the bs up again he would kick me out and I could find a place to kms cause he wouldn’t let me use that as an “excuse” in his house. On top of that, he shamed me for several other things like having a cup of tea in my room and said me taking anxiety meds was me doing drugs. I just feel broken. I’m scared and shaky as I write this. I wanna pack my things and leave my house but there’s really no point since I leave for college in a few weeks anyways.

Side note: I’m okay mentally, I never explicitly told him I wanted to kms I just said sometimes I wondered if I shouldn’t have existed. Like why am I here type of thing. I’m okay guys :)"
"TW: Mentions of suicide, self harm

My mom is not all mentally there. She suffered from encephalitis a few years ago and her brain has never been the same since. Now, whenever we have a slight argument, she starts screaming about how she wishes she died in the hospital. Today, I needed to use both my arms and grab her because she was mere inches from the knife block. She regularly informs all of us about how she fantasizes about killing herself in my room so I remember it. She told me today after our argument that even though dad hid his guns, she is going to find other ways to do it. I don't know how much longer I can take this. Right now she's sobbing and screaming to my father about how much she's been planning. What can I do?"
"I (30f) am very close to my mom (60f) now, but I absolutely hated her growing up. She was both emotionally and physically abusive. I somewhat understand why now—she was going through a lot and was essentially a single mom raising not only her kids but also my sister's kids. We lived in a small house, she was making much less money, etc. However, some things I just can’t get over, and I get so angry about them.

There's one specific memory that I just don’t understand. The only reason I’m thinking of it now is that my husband and I want to redo our yard.

Anyway, my mom had a row of small hedges in our front yard with rocks underneath. Randomly, she would decide that my sister and I had to remove the tiny fallen leaves from the hedges out of the rocks. She would make us get up super early in the morning while she went to work, stop us when it got hot, and then make us go back out in the evenings. One time the fair was down the street, so people would park on our street and walk by us and we had to watch them with envy. 

I really feel like she did this to torture us because I don’t see any other reason to have your elementary daughters do this. Leaves fall. Why have rocks somewhere if you don’t want leaves in them? Even if we made it perfect, leaves would fall right back in.

I understand that teaching your kids yard work is good. I know she had to do yard work growing up, like pulling weeds, but doesn’t this specific task sound insane and cruel? Was she trying to make us as miserable as she was? This may not be abuse but it’s something  or am I just being a crybaby? 

Though we're close now, I cannot even mention the way she was in the past because she immediately gets super defensive."
"Trigger warning: Suicide, emotional and physical abuse.

I’m at a loss as to what to think or do or how to process this. 

My abusive father who had not spoken to me for 15 years, killed himself on my birthday. There are two options. One is that he didn’t know it was my birthday, likely as he rarely remembered. OR he knew and I don’t know why he wanted to hurt me. 

I’m on an emotional rollercoaster but I’m also not sure. What do I tell my kids? My siblings have had contact even though it was challenging for them, so the suicide and all will come out. I just don’t know what to say to a 7 and 11 year old who didn’t even know him. But they will

"I'm 17 (f) I've been abused my parents my whole life, my bio dad left when I was little and my step dad left my bio mum because of how abusive she was towards all of us and I stayed with him. big mistake, my step mum (my step dad's girlfriend) is just as bad if not worse, our most recent argument is because I said my little brother (who's autistic) has cereal sometimes and he screamed at me for saying it and now both of my step parents are screaming at me to get a job (when I've been trying for over a year but there's not many job opportunities in my area) and are saying I have to move out. I need to get out of this situation now, I have both my boyfriend and my best friend offering for me to stay with them after I open a bank account that my parents can't access but my step dad has repeatedly said to me that I'm not allowed to leave until I'm 18, my birthday is in March and I can't hold on until then. they're not my legal guardians, can I leave. please if anyone has any sort of advice I'm begging for help.

"I literally cannot do this anymore. I hate my father, I hate him so much. I always have. I hated him when he would deprive me of lunch until I was able to speak. I hated him when he would make me choose between getting beaten with a brush or a belt. I just can’t man, I can’t live like this anymore. 

Everyone says “move out when you’re eighteen!” But where would I go? I have no family in state, I have no financially stable friends, and I don’t see my mom getting a divorce anywhere in the near future. 

I know he knows I hate him. I know he knows my brother and my mother hate him as well. I just don’t know why he won’t leave.

I literally think in the near future I’ll genuinely hurt him or myself if one of us doesn’t leave. "
"He has cheated on her wife, beated me, insulted my intelligence, yelled at me, forced me to be a sports champion which being genuine to you I didn't enjoy until I got away from sports as a whole, he treatened me with an enrolling in the military (The country I live has awful military tactics), he always belittled my trophies, he insulted me while being both at the top of my class and an academic genius according to my teachers only because he thought I should be what he never was, a soccer player which is to me a boring sport I began to have some feelings that lead me to hate sports as a whole in comparisson to sports I think are cool (Mostly Boxing and MMA, even when I would never practice that profesionally) Sometimes I wish my mom married that Korean Bussiness man instead of the politician jerk my dad is. Is it somehow wrong to just want to stab him even when I am aware I won't do that due to my values and laws being against it?"
I have a very emotionally abusive mother who is very manipulative and has made my life very hard. She wants me to go with her on a road trip and I don’t think I can handle the pressure of being with her for multiple days on end. I know if I don’t go she will either go alone and never stop making me feel guilty for not going with her or she won’t go at all and make me feel guilty because she didn’t go on “vacation.” Someone give me advice 
"Got woken up, yelled at, made to feel guilty and reprimanded by my father today for having the audacity to sleep at an hour that he doesn't think is normal. For the record, I'm an adult and I have huge sleeping problems and some nights I barely get any sleep, so my sleeping schedule is really difficult and I had finally fallen asleep for a bit in the afternoon before he woke me up. And it was to be rested for something he needed me to do no less.

Anyway, it made me think about everything. And it just made me realize that I trust any random stranger more than either of my parents.

I would not trust either of my parents enough to tell them what I am currently sharing here. I would not trust them to share pretty much any of the stuff I've shared on Reddit. There is, I think, not a single person that I trust less than my parents to share my feelings with. Hell, I wouldn't even trust them enough to share the fandom stuff I post on here. Decent chance they'd criticize, make fun of or denigrate me for it. Might get angry I'm doing that instead of something better.

Of course, it's not hard to tell why I don't trust them to share my feelings. My father will throw my feelings back in my face, dismiss them, reprimand or denigrate me. Maybe while yelling at me if he feels like it that day. My mother may sometimes act somewhat understanding to my face, at least when she's not in a yelling mood or argues or throws a tantrum, but even then will either do nothing or use them later to try to manipulate me behind my back.

Recently I talked to ChatGPT about some of the stuff that's happened with them. And then I had it list what the long-term consequences of that might be on a child if they experienced that during their entire childhood. The AI listed: Low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, trust issues, difficulty setting boundaries, social problems, learned helplessness, perfectionism and fear of failure, emotional dysregulation, physical health issues such as headaches and avoidant behaviours.

Which is just... yeah, I pretty much have all of those except trust issues (with people except my parents). And these things are basically the root of every single thing that has made my life miserable for the last ten years.

I've struggled with my mental health for a long time and for a long time I just thought I was kind of fucked up in some fundamental way. But over the last few years I've learned that... no, probably not. I was probably born as mentally healthy as the majority of children. But I was just broken down completely by parents who constantly yelled at, insulted, criticized, emotionally manipulated, etc. me throughout my entire life. And if it wasn't for that, I'd probably be living a happy, productive life right now. Instead of severely depressed, unemployed, alone and barely able to go out due to anxiety.

It's a bitter realization. Though it does help put things into perspective."
"My parents have given up on me. According to them they I remind them of everything they failed at as a parent and they no longer want me around. They can't kick me out so now they're trying to get me to end it myself.

They did this in the past, and were close to succeeding. They find every little thing I'm doing wrong and they knit pick and don't stop until I am diminished to nothing. They left me a card on the table and I'm pretty sure it's something about how the will no longer be funding me at school and how much of a failure I am. I'm just tempted to throw it out or open it then end myself. I'm closer to ending it then I ever have before. I have nowhere to go, no friends, and 2 strong kick in the ass asholes.

I hate them so much. I don't understand why me being a live is to much of a privilege."
"I, 30F have been contemplating this for some time and not sure if this is a correct term to say my dad is a narcissist. I will be using fake names, just in case if this happens to show up on Youtube or Facebook. 

  
During my childhood, my dad never really spent time with me. At most, it was forced by my mom. And usually it was out of necessity rather than wanting to. As early as I can remember, my dad, never spent time with me as he did with my older siblings, Abigail (fake name) and Luke (fake name). When they came over, my dad was neglectful, at most I would do things on purpose to get in trouble because to me, at the time, it was a way to get some form of attention from my father rather than none at all. As a child, we struggled financially. My dad would spend every dime on my two older siblings, I suppose to make sure they had a good time with my dad. Many times my mom stole food from the jobs she worked at, so we could at least have a proper meal. Growing up, my mom and dad had martial issues, and at most it was usually when my dad spent all of the money on my two older siblings, while we (mom, myself, and little sister) struggled. There were times she had to ask my grandparents to assist her in getting diapers and groceries for us. I guess my mom had a hard time trusting my dad after he cheated on her when I was 6 months old, so that may have been part of their issues. The water was turned off around that time, because my dad, again, would spend our funds on my older siblings and we also had no heating. CPS came to the house because of it and we were nearly removed from my parents care until my grandparents (moms parents) stepped in to help. 

  
My dads family didn't like my mom. Per of what my mom told me, but I'm not really sure because I can't ask her and I refuse to speak to my dads side of the family. 

  
At the age of 7, we all packed up and moved to Ohio. My dad, mom, myself, little sister, and my baby sister. My mom was basically a stay at home wife, and tried her best to do the best she could. She had postpartum depression, maybe even severe. And instead of my dad getting her help or at least being a supportive husband, he cheated on my mom with his coworker at the time. Now mind you, my mom had her suspicions he was cheating but could never catch him until one night they got into a huge fight. I don't remember much of the details because it has been years. However, that night my dad brought home his coworker, and how the house was set up, there were three bedrooms upstairs and a bedroom in the basement. The bedroom was directly beneath their room and my mom could hear everything. I didn't find out these details until much later on in life, but it opened my eyes to things I didn't really know as a kid. That following weekend, my dad took us three girls to his coworkers house and we all stayed the weekend there. At the time, things were really fun and we all enjoyed ourselves. His coworker had three children of her own and we all become friends rather quickly. When we came back home, I wanted to stay again over the weekend and asked his coworker if I could but I had to ask my mom. My mom was washing dishes and I asked her if I could stay, in which she told me to pack my sh\*t and get the f\*ck out. Again, I was 7 at the time, so it hurt and I didn't understand what I did. It blew up into a huge fight, in which my mom grabbed a kn\*fe and my dads coworker grabbed the baseball bat. My dad told her that if both of them got arrested, he would bail out his coworker before he would bail out my mom. In which my mom left the following day. Years later, I found out from my mom, she had left a letter for all of us but we never saw it, much less knew of it existence until my mom told me. 

  
During the divorce, myself and my little sister had to stay at my aunts house for the summer and it was fun. Probably the most fun I had during that time. It changed once my cousin SAed me. There are some things I remember that night, but some things are a huge blur. I still don't know to this day, how I was back in my bed before my aunt got up. My aunt wanted to adopt my little sister and me but my dad said no and took us back home. 

  
The first two years with my dads coworker, yes he was still with her, Deedee (real name because she doesn't deserve to have a fake name) were good. She was my second mom. Though we didn't do much things together, but my mom was basically MIA, so she filled in where my mom didn't. Over time, things started to change. She would treat me differently compared to my siblings. Accuse me of stealing money, ""forget"" to feed me, and left me in the care of her mom. While my siblings got new things, I was given hammy downs or things from goodwill. Her mom didn't like me, at all. She would say mean and hurtful things to me. Once, while she was babysitting me, she forced me to stand in the corner just because I got off the couch to get a glass of water. I'm not entirely sure how long I was standing in the corner but I asked her if I could come out. She told me if I asked again, she would whoop my bottom. Some time went by and I asked her again if I could leave the corner. Next, she lifted me up and threw me across the room. Thankfully there was a couch pressed up against the wall, otherwise, I would've been thrown out the window. I told my dad, and for once, he actually cared. Deedee and my dad got into a huge fight about it and her mom never watched me again. However, the treatment toward me never changed, only got worse from that point on. My step siblings and my bio siblings, were able to do whatever they wanted, while I was still being accused of everything under the sun. Given a nickname ""Teresa Jr"", told I was going to end up like my mom, I would never amount to anything, I was worthless, and no one cared about me. In which, suppose no one did because my dad allowed it to go on for 10 1/2 years. I was Cinderella, the only difference was, I didn't sleep on cinders. 

  
During this time, there was a moment I ""stole"" from school, which how are you stealing if it's given to you for free? The school I was going to in Ohio, we were given free lunches and I would take home the orange juice cartons from school. My siblings were doing it as well, so I figured ""why not"" but in hindsight, I should've known better. I was struggling with my homework and being able to do it because I was also caring for my step mom (perfectly healthy) and my siblings. My teachers looked through my book bag and found cartons of orange juice (which I guess you could say I was depressed) and they called up my dad and step mom. When I got home, they kept yelling at me and asking if I was stealing. I swore up and down I didn't steal. My dad threatened me and told me that if he found out I was stealing, he would have something waiting for me when I got home. The next day, I spoke with the lunch lady and apologized for stealing. She didn't understand what I was apologizing for since it was freely given to me and I could do whatever I wanted with it. Somehow, my dad and step mom found and when I got home later on that day, there was a stack of rulers waiting for me, brand new and sitting on the table (wooden ruler with the metal stripping wrapped around it) and spanked me with it. If one broke, the others were there to be used as well. My siblings were also taking things from the cafeteria, but I was the only one who was punished for it. I was grounded and was forced to go to bed early every night until my dad said I was off punishment. My siblings would rub it in, and laugh at me for it. 

  
There were many things that were questionable and maybe CPS should have been involved, which they did when I got into Highschool. Things were ramping up with my step mom and she would accuse me of being sexually active because I didn't have a period. Most months I would have a period and some I wouldn't. I nearly died twice because of me bleeding for months at a time. My dad never questioned it but would still get me female products. My dad, at the time, left her and I thought it was for good, but he brought her back for a time. She noticed I was extremely pale and wouldn't swim with the others. For once, she cared and scolded my dad for not noticing and they rushed me to the hospital. Turns out, you can die from losing too much blood from your monthly. They needed to do a emergency blood transfusion and god did I hate it. But knowing all of this and being there for me, she still accused me of those things. In highschool, I had an accident during my monthly, the school called her and she didn't pick me up until after school. And berated me all the way home. She told me, that she didn't pick me up from school or bring me a change of clothes, was because I had done it on purpose and that she was going to let me suffer. My dad was selective when he cared and yelled at her for it. Yes, they did get married and yes they were way too toxic for one another. She started accusing my dad of cheating (in which he was) and gifts he received from his job, she would destroy it. They got a divorce some time later and we moved to Florida with a friend. 

  
My little sister started bullying me some time after that. I've always struggled with my weight and my little sister was allowed to get away with it. ""Sisters will be sisters"" or ""She's just teasing you. Grow up."" She was never scolded for this behavior and would continue on until we moved to Indiana and there after. Suppose it was because he had his doubts if my little sister was actually his. A story for another time. And so, she was also allowed to get away with things, dictate who my dad dated, if he drank, etc. Basically being like his wife, which to me is weird. My dad and I was never close after that, despite trying to act like he was my savior because of a dream he had, in which he has told other people a different story why he left his ex wife. I was forced to work a baby sitting job because my dad refused to buy things I needed for school, while as he handled things for my little sisters. New clothes, new school supplies, etc. I wasn't allowed to have a formal job, which is understandable because I struggled with school, but never got the help for my school work. My dad always had an excuse. But was more than willing to help my sisters with their school work. There was a time in high school when I was looking of colleges because I wanted to better myself and do something with my life, my dad saw I was looking up colleges and asked ""Why are you bothering with that when you can barely pass highschool"". I was absolutely torn and stopped looking up colleges at that point. I realized back then that nothing I ever did was good enough, even when I was doing very well in school (Ohio I had a 3.9 GPA but changed from the constant moving and needing to take care of my siblings). I was barely home and preferred to stay at my friends house, rather than go home because all I ever got was abuse and neglect from my family. I told my grandma (dads mom), I wanted to be a police officer, really a forensic psychologist and my grandma laughed in my face and told me I was too fat to be a police officer. I had no support from anyone. Neither side of my family and my dad along with my siblings made life worse for me and complicated. It was hard to make friends in school, most thought I was weird but usually had a very small group of friends. During this time, Myspace was widely known and I added my older sister as a friend. I tried everything I could to be closer to my older sister but she wanted nothing to do with me. One day, she tried calling up my dad, and she couldn't get ahold of him. I'm not entirely sure why, but she contacted my grandma about me being bisexual, I wasn't ready to come out to my dad yet. Adam Lambert was my idol and I looked up to him because he was my inspiration. Although, I still wasn't ready but I was going to tell my dad. However, my grandma beat me to it. On my way home from school, my dad called me and yelled at me and told me I wasn't bisexual and that it was just a phase. My dad refused to speak to me after that for months. I told my mom and I expected her to be the same as my dad, however, she wasn't. In fact, I will always remember these words until the day I die. ""No matter who you fall in love with, you will always be my daughter. No matter what. And I'll welcome whomever you fall in love with open arms, man or woman."" I cried over the phone with my mom and told her everything. She was disappointed with my dad and I stayed with her over the weekend. My mom wasn't in my life much, but when she was, it meant a lot to me. 

  
My dad met someone new during this time. Though, she was already with someone but that's a story for another time. And they started seeing each other. As I mentioned, my mom wasn't always in my life but when she was, it meant a lot. However, the times I really needed her, she was never there or would come up with some form of an excuse as to why she couldn't be there. My step mom sat in my moms seat during the day of my graduation and I'm very grateful for that because it meant a lot to me. However, my dad kept trying to push on to me that she was my mom and I should call her mom. Ever since my dads ex wife, I've not been able to view another woman as ""mom"" because of the abuse I went through for 10 1/2 years while my dad allowed it to happen until he got tired of the treatment put on to him. We would fight about it until I cut contact with him. I moved to Florida after I graduated Highschool to be with a boyfriend I met online. Not all relationships are like this but the last two before I met my husband, they were abusive. Cheating on me and other things. When I needed help, I couldn't depend on my dad and still can't. My dad has told people who were going to help me ""She got herself into this mess, she can get herself out of it."" So they would leave me until I was able to get myself out of it, and anything was better than what I was dealing with. When I moved back to Indiana and moved in with my grandma, she thought I was using her because of my older sister decided to put into her head that I was just going to use people. I was trying to rebuild a relationship with my dad and fix things, however, she kicked me out and told me to ""Get the f\*ck"" out. To this day, I haven't spoken to her. My dad and step mom were trying to put stipulations on me, friends I could hang out with, being online, etc. And I moved in with my best friend at the time. However, things weren't going great and I asked if I could move back in, of course my step mom had to say something and told me ""What makes you think you can move back in?"" My dad would rather put me in a homeless shelter rather than help me. But he has helped my other siblings than me. And no, as far as I know, I'm my dads child. So the ill treatment is beyond me. 

  
During Covid, my mom passed away and it was hard for me. Extremely hard. My husband has told me I was basically in shock. I lost most of my hair because of the stress and I just couldn't be a human. Most of that week is a blur and I couldn't go to my moms funeral because of funds and vehicle issues. My dad told me during that week ""If your mom didn't have the issues she had, we would still be together."" I'm not sure what he was trying to gain from that, but it tore me to pieces when he told me that. He has a habit of painting himself out to be a victim, will wave his masters degree in your face but not use it. I went NC with my dad, step mom, siblings, and his whole side of the family, including my moms side of the family. My moms side of the family is for another day. 

  
I gave my dad another shot nearly 4 years ago and wanted to meet up for a family trip. My husband doesn't like my dad but wanted to give him a chance for me. I told my dad I had quit smoking during that time and he asked me if he makes me feel anxious, which I was honest and told him yes he did. He decided to tell me ""Well, I hope we don't cause you to smoke again."" I hung up and didn't speak to him until 2 years ago. My husband and I were having marital issues and hoped he would let me stay with him for a time, but he told me he couldn't because they have no money and he would have to ask Mary (fake name). I knew where it would lead and haven't bothered to call him ever since. And yes, hubby and I are still together and just celebrated our 10 year anniversary. 

  
There are times I want to call him and just talk to him, tell him about my day and tell him just how things are. I think it stems from losing my mom and how much we would call and talk to each other before I cut contact with her before she passed away. However, talking to him about past things has got us no where. At the end of the phone call, I usually end up in tears because he just tells me ""I'm sorry if you feel that way."" When I told him about the SA from my cousin, he told me ""I don't know what to believe"" and ""What do you want me to do about it?"" along with his wife ""Get over it."" 

  
So I'm asking you, reddit, is my dad a narcissist? Or am I putting a label on him that is now becoming a common label for many people. Should I try giving him a chance? I apologize for the long post. "
"It’s ironic but I’ve seen MANY people saying to kids here “shes your mom go apologise” when their parents hit them example

Or not listening lgbtq kids and doing the exact same thing as their parents

This sub is disgusting i think if you’re minor DO NOT ask help here I’ve read so many posts and comments to make this post so I don’t spread misinformation because of couple people but this is a big problem 

One person here is so bad i would want them to get banned from this sub.. not naming names so I won’t get banned i wanna stay here and at least help few kids here since other adults keep abusing abused kids.. ew"
"I remember my dad beating me up from time to time (I would end up on the floor), but it wasn't very often, but I don't remember any details. Only from the most recent which was when I was probably 17. Yet, I asked my family and everybody said my dad never touched me. Also I've been thinking that if that were the case, teachers or healthcare professionals should have realized, right? Even though it was not very often. Is my family forgetting it? Or did I make it up? If so, why am I so traumatized by drunk people? I don't understand. Did I cause trauma to myself with false memories?"
"This probably would fit more to “insane parents” but they don’t allow posting without pictures of private texts or facebook posts which is illegal at least where i live to share and I speak different language with them..

But my parents are/were abusive so i post here this isn’t just one of those cases since I’m already 18

ANYWAY i was on vacation with my dad and my mom came to my house to give my hamster fresh water BUT she left cucumber to ROT in the cage/tank and now there is mites all over the cage and this happened to me like 2 months ago and SHE KNOWS i had to pay 100€ to clean it and buy new stuff and you know the whole process and it was good UNTIL NOW THAT SHE DID THE SAME

I would be like okay fine accidents happen come help me clean it up since it’s not easy process and i called her SHE STARTED ACCUSING ME SAYING IT’S MY FAULT AND “I didn’t know that hamster wouldn’t eat it” OK? IT’S STILL IN YOUR FAULT COME HELP ME TO CLEAN IT UP!? She hang up on me.

She won’t come help me says it’s my fault and won’t understand it’s on her..

I’m literally crying in my bed right now because i live in different city than any of my friends i have no one to help me and she just hung up on me…
I hate her like i don’t care if she’s my mom she’s so childish and selfish I’m so sick of this sht i know this post isn’t like asking for help i just needed to rant somewhere because I’m so frustrated I’m also autistic so this is WAY harder for me to deal with.."
"My mother has given me permanent anxiety and paranoia. Since there's a door blocking the ground floor and the little area housing the door to the backyard and the stairs to her apartment in the basement, and I live on the ground floor, she will rapid-fire bang on the door and will yell at me if I don't open it in 0.1 seconds, and that gives me anxiety that any little, small, and insignificant bang is her at the door, which, 8/10, it's not her. I can't listen to my favorite songs because the drums give me anxiety and paranoia, thinking that it's her at the door. I have to live in complete silence—apart from the ambience of the town I live in—so I can listen to hear if she bangs at the door so I can run and answer it. My grandparents are control freaks and it's their house so that door has to be locked at all times. So I have to keep it locked because they are letting me live here for free, so I feel bad for breaking any rules and try to follow them to the best of my ability, but my mother is driving me crazy. It feels like I have to get up to open the door for her every other hour."
"Please tell me I'm right on this... I'm a trans dude but my parents are both transphobes and performative woke a-holes (they say they support lgbt but not really) and don't wanna see me as a man. They deny that I'm a real dude, make me dress fem, and make snarky comments about me looking ""too mannish"" and being ""too weird"". I'm getting better at calling out their bs (especially when they smack talk other lgbt people - hell no!) but it still hurts that I can't safely be myself. It feels painful that the people I legally can't get away from are also chipping away at my sanity every day. Obviously not gonna be able to get hrt for a while either, but at least I can dress in an affirming manner. I'm going crazy in here...

I know it's not NEARLY as bad as 90% of lgbt people out there, but sometimes I just want more. I'm happy to at least be able to call myself what I am, but I still wish things were different. Things are good in the grand scheme of everything. I haven't been kicked out or threatened with violence, at least. "
im a 14 year old boy in north carolina with a younger sister.  my parents have been scolding me for no apparent reason and often put me down. they say that i have attitude when i speak even if i'm just saying no to something. they make me pay for my cloths. i make money by mowing the lawn and threaten to take away payment if i don't comply. also they say that i'm spoiled and should be greatful for what i have and i am greatful but they don't seem to get it. my sister recently broke her ipad and instead of making her repair with her own money (which she can afford) they buy her a brand new one. also they bought her a new chromebook for no reason and she didn't even need one for school or home reasons. i know if that happened to my phone they would laugh and make me pay for it. my parents also act very kind and friendly to guests but when they leave they're back to normal. but on the other hand they have given me a phone and taken the family on trips so i'm no sure if i'm being abused or i'm just overreacting and sensitive.
"I'm a 20 year old female in college, and I'm back home for the summer. I have always felt that my mom has always been controlling and emotionally abusive growing up. My parents supported me through my first year of college out of state (I didn't get into the university in state that they wanted me to go), and I transferred back in state for my upcoming sophomore year. Throughout my first year of college, every time my mom called me, she would remind me about how expensive the out of state tuition is, and that I needed to transfer back in state for my sophomore year no matter what. She also threatened me that if I didn't, she would force me to break up with my boyfriend and that I would have to pay for the tuition by myself. Fyi, my mom was the one that made the decision for me to go to that out of state school, because she thought that if I couldn't transfer back to the in state school that she liked, at least that university is better than the community college or other in state schools that I got into. Throughout the entire year, I was very stressed and anxious because of her constant calls to complain about her expenses and threats. As many asian parents do, she constantly compares me to other kids she knows, and recently since I'm back home for the summer, it has been about me not being independent enough. One example she gave was how her friends' daughter found her college apartment herself, and how she works so she barely has to ask her parents for any allowances. But when I wanted to go tour apartments with my boyfriend, she demanded that we brought her along because she thinks we don't have enough experience to make a good decision. As I mentioned before, she doesn't like my boyfriend because he wasn't very focused on his studies in high school, and he didn't get into a good university in her opinion. At the start of our relationship, she constantly said that he wasn't good enough for me. We have been together for almost a year now doing long distance, and she has been waiting for the relationship to die out. Since about a few months ago, she has transitioned to saying that he will most probably dump me when we're doing long distance, and she said that she's saying that to prepare me mentally. She also said that she is okay with me dating him, but not is I marry him, and that I want to marry him she will kick me out of the house and not support me. She has also introduced me to a family friend's son, and jokingly said that I should date him instead because his family is wealthy. My dad has always enabled her behaviour, and just told me to accept who she is and ignore her and not get mad. I know he just doesn't want to start a fight with her, but I don't understand how he can always watch me always get hurt by her and not do anything about it. I know she loves me, and that she wants the best for me, but I have always felt hurt and angry towards how she raised me and how she is continuing to control and dictate my life. I'm scared to have children in the future in fear that I will turn out to be like her. Sometimes I tell myself that asian parents just parent like this, and I should just accept it and move on. But I have also never seen my friends' or other asian parents as extreme as my mom. I honestly don't know what to do and I don't even know if this is considered as emotional abuse or just asian culture/ parenting. I have recently thought about moving out and cutting her off. I just really wish she didn't always want to make decisions for me that will impact me for the rest of my life. 

  
at this point I'm just ranting to make myself feel better. feel free to leave any opinions or advice as I'm feeling very lost rn "
"My mom had been beating me my whole life, and I can't put up with it anymore. She thinks I should get beat for every little thing I do wrong. I live with my grandma now because she kept leaving me at home by myself (sometimes with no food.) and I kept calling my grandma or aunt whenever I needed something. Yesterday my grandma tried to beat me with a belt because she lost her keys and she thought I took them, I told my uncle that if she puts her hands on me she's going to jail. My grandma heard me and she told my mom what I said. My mom talked to me and she said ""who do you think you are?"" And ""I'm going to put my hands all over you, since you wanna threaten my mom."". She said she was coming to take me back and my big cousin Steve said we could live with him for a while until my mom gets her own place. But I don't wanna live with my mom. I don't wanna spend the rest of my teenage years with her. I don't wanna get beat for every mistake I make, I can't handle it anymore. I called the cops on her when I was 8 because she threw a fork at my head. It wasn't enough to put her in jail, so they let her go. My whole family heard about it and they all lectured me for even thinking about calling the cops on my mom. Since my mom is coming I think she's gonna beat me when she gets here, but she never said when she was coming.  My family thinks that I call the cops on anyone who tries to punish me. They think I'm entitled. They don't see what my mom does as abuse, they see it as punishment. And it sickens me. Anytime I tell them what she does they say ""you shouldn't have been bad"". I can't help but feel like I'm wrong. My family makes it seem like I do whatever and don't wanna get punished when I do wrong. My mom's also not like other moms. She never sung me a lullaby, never read me a bedtime story, and is rather tough. I can never ask her where she is because she would never tell me. She would just say ""I'm in my skin."" Or ""none of your business."" I also see her post on social media. She always in clubs, partying, or with friends. I can't help but feel she doesn't care about me anymore.


(I'm 14f, I'm not in school, I haven't been in school for a while year, I can't go outside, I also have an Older brother who lives with me.)


Sorry I went a little of topic I'm just really stressed out."
"14F. From when I was little she hit me and shouted at me , emotionally and physically abused me. I watched her fight with my other family too .

She didn’t teach me to do anything like chores or to take care of myself. She only ever really taught me one or two things but. She always complains she only does things in the house and she says we walk all over her . I know I’ve been a bad kid , i disobey her and argue with her all the time . Usually over her turning off the internet randomly or coming in to tell me to get of my phone . I don’t know why I’m so argumentative. I don’t wanna do anything she says

Now I’ve been trying to avoid hwr because she’s pregnant and I don’t want to annoy her but I snapped . She randomly just turned the Wi-Fi off while I was typing something , I went to ask her and she said I needed to have a break . I told her that it was early and we started arguing . She took the Wi-Fi box and I started crying and telling her to keep her promise .

I really sounded like a horrible whiny brat. 
I’ve been telling her to rest more and stuff but she doesn’t listen, I don’t have the energy to do anything so I can’t even help.

She started screaming really loud and crying I told her to stop screaming she was complaining. About how she does everything and I do nothing and I still complain . She’s right. It’s mostly me who’s starting things. I don’t even deserve to be in this sub because it’s my fault.


I know my rooms a mess and all I do is sit on my pc . I’ve beeen very depressed lately so I haven’t beeen cleaning and my rooms stacked with plates . And I haven’t done anything besides sleep a lot and go on my pc

All I do is stress her and anger her I’m a horrible daughter and I always react so angrily over small things.  I don’t know why, I just have no energy to do anything else. Not even shower. My mom knows I’m struggling mentally but she just uses it against me.

I know I sound like a spoiled brat who’s always annoyed or complaining I’m sorry mom.

I don’t know why I get so mad over small things 

Edit1: I went to her and cried that I didn’t know why I got so angry. I gave her a hug . I just I felt so horrible for stressing her and acting so spoiled , shouting over the internet out of all things.

It’s almost like I’ve become her and she’s become me

When I was younger  she’d get mad over nothing and shout and hurt me, then apologise 

Now I’m doing the same expect she still shouts and hits . But it’s my fault. I always start it."
"Hi there, Reddit! I’m not accustomed to this website though I could spend hours scrolling through text-to-speech stories. I’d never thought I’d be here to write out a story, but here I am! I’d like to get some advice as I’m stuck between two possibilities for my future. All advice is wanted! Without further ado, here’s the story. (It’ll be a long one)

I (F17) have lived with my mom (F50s) and dad (M50s) for my entire life. My childhood up until about 11-12 is a blur to me, but ever since then, I’ve been dealing with a lot of conflicts; most of these issues come from my mom. It’s hard to describe her in a word, but I feel as if “emotionally abusive” would be one I hear tossed around when she’s mentioned. In a short summary- will expand on later- she mocks me for my interests, weight, and general likeness. She puts me down a lot, is extremely manipulative, and has her thumb over me 24/7- even now at 17. I’m going to be turning 18 soon, which is important to this story.

I’ve had a lot of conflict coming to terms with “if i’m the asshole” or not. I cannot say I’m a perfect child, as I’ve had a track record of lying to her about being on the internet. Lying has become second nature with her. Since I was 12, I’ve been infatuated with the people I meet online. They provide me a lot of comfort in friendship that I can’t find in real life. I find people with common interests, share my art, and overall enjoy speaking with them! I’ve been fairly careful, though reckless as well. My mom, however, believes everybody on the internet is out to kill me. [Partly that may be true, but after a certain point, you can trust certain individuals.] She has been known to go through my messages, search history, google drive … etc etc etc. She has been very watchful of me, but apparently not enough as I’ve been avoiding being caught for a year or so now. Either or, she is protective of me to the point it is suffocating. This is one piece of many things that build up to my current situation.

Another large piece is her tendencies to put me down as well through my studies. Through my entirety of school, I’ve been a straight A student with exception of a few B’s. I have a very poor motivation factor which leads me to be lazy, frankly, and I skate by a lot by doing things last minute. She puts me down for my grades, however, even if its an A-. She and my dad (I’ll dive into him later) believe I don’t do enough with my life despite having a job for about 4 days a week and juggling classes. I just finished a few online college classes and even then, they both seemed apprehensive to tell me I’d done well for getting A’s. It baffles me how they seem proud over other kids’ achievements when they have rarely ever expressed their appreciation to my work. I find myself compared to other kids around me a lot because they are in sports and cheerleading and yada yada yada … I’ve played a sport my mom played when she was growing up until I opted to focus on my job. Least to say she also wasn’t pleased about that. She made it all about competition and the fun was taken away when she’d yell at me from across the fence to try harder. 

On the topic, my self esteem is crushed because of her. I am an overweight girl and I can admit it. I am not proud of who I am, let alone can I love myself because of her comments to me on a day-to-day basis. She’ll make snide remarks about how ‘that shirt doesn’t look flattering’ or ‘oh so you can’t wear these pants anymore because you put on weight… you’ll have to go up another size’. I can’t say I’m morbidly obese, but I’m not super thin either. I’ve been told by people I look nice, but all hopes of believing it has vanished with her making fun of me at the dinner table. She has placed the blame of me not being able to make friends on not “taking care of myself”. I can recall an instance where I had a breakdown at school about how I felt alone. I get home, ask if we can talk, and she starts lecturing me on how if I tried harder and conformed to other people’s likes, I’d be well liked. I started zoning out and she got upset, saying I “couldn’t take the criticism and was just like my grandma”. I get compared to her mom a lot. She had a hard childhood growing up with an emotionally absent mom who also commented on her weight. She didn’t have it easy, but surely it isn’t an excuse for her behavior.

I cannot say I’ve had a rough childhood through possessions. During my life, I’ve been given a LOT of nice things. I can admit I’m spoiled, even now, and I have a lot that most don’t. We aren’t rich, but we are well off with my dad’s job. They’ve done a lot of nice things for me, as paying for my car’s insurance so I only worry about gas about half the time. I’ve been paying for my own luxuries since last September when I started my job, but that doesn’t mean I don’t buy them dinner a lot. I’ve become the busboy to pick up their dinner, sometimes on my own accord. 

I’ve been told by my mom I can come to her with my issues. I come to her with my problems, and she beats me down for them. I’ve learned to avoid her with my personal issues, and she becomes upset with me for being distant. There was a time my grandma (mom’s mom) outed me to my mother saying that I wasn’t sure if I liked girls. My mom sat in the restaurant we went to and sobbed, holding my dad’s hand and calling me a disgrace to the family. [I remember at 8 years old she told me she’d kick me out if she found out I was gay.] We got home after a silent ride home and told me to get out. I began to walk to the nearest town as I live in the country before my dad came and picked me up. I’d had to throw my ex-friends (long story.) under the bus and say they influenced me for her to get off my case. She isn’t a church-goer but adheres to christian values. I’ve tried to run away many times before, but i’ve never gotten farther than a few minutes away.

She makes me feel very guilty about my now dead grandma (dad’s side) by using her as a figment to make me feel bad about my actions. If I do something she deems irresponsible or bad, she will tell me that “she’s looking down at you disappointed” or “she never would’ve liked that”. My mom forgets to mention how she also neglected my grandmother in her dying years and cries about how she misses her when she NEVER helped her. My dad’s mom was my biggest supporter for awhile, and losing her took a toll on me. My mom using her dead presence as a threat gets on my nerves.
…

Now the biggest piece of this apprehension toward her comes from yesterday. We’d gotten into an argument when I’d snapped at her under stress of finishing a college class. She told me I’d be getting my car taken away and stormed off. I went to get ready for work and as I’m walking to the bathroom, she begins to rant. She talks about how I walk all over her and that I treat her like the dirt on the bottom of my shoe. She mentions how I only care about myself- which I believe I’m caring to others-  and my dearest cat, and then drops a bombshell. (I’ll be paraphrasing as I can’t remember the exact words.)

“My love for you is unconditional, __, but there’s a breaking point. It turns into resentment.. and then hatred.”

I raised my eyebrows. For the longest time, her scoldings and verbal beatings made me numb. I’d stand there, listen, and have it go in and out of my head. Her arguments were always the same, about how I was an ungrateful brat who never did anything for them.. but this was different. She responded,

“Yeah, __, I hate you some days.”

My mom admitted to hating me. Never ever had she done this; the lowest she would get is refusing to say she loved me. After this I began to cry silently as she told me at 18 if I didn’t have my shit together, I’d be kicked out with nothing to my name. In my mind, I’d already checked out. I knew I couldn’t do this anymore. I’d called many close people to me before crying about her, and too many times she’d act like nothing happened. She has broken me down so much that I feel worthless, just as she describes I’ve done to her. I’ve contemplated things because of her words, because of her apprehension to me. She has no friends and always told me I’m all she has aside from my dad. She has told me she wouldn’t live on without me. I hate her. I hate my mom a lot. She has ruined my trust issues and my overall wellbeing over the span of 17 years. 

Now, enter two people who have changed my perception. Dakota (F17) and Rose (F40s) have changed my life a lot in many positive ways. Dakota is my best friend and I spend a lot of time with her and her mom, Rose. We’ve gone out together and done things as a group, especially after a trip to another country we went on earlier in the year. Rose is one of the sweetest ladies I’ve met, and while her English is a little hard to understand, she has a massive heart. She has treated me better than any adult in my life has up to this point and since that trip, she has been a big support for me. Dakota and I go to the same school, though we live in towns about 15 minutes away, and are also very close. She knows about every detail of my family and has always been there for me for about two years or so. After the episode with my mom the day prior, I’d called Dakota to report what’d happened. We’ve talked before about me “moving in” to her house, though it never seemed like a possibility. Last night we talked about the chance and how it seemed plausible given a few sacrifices on my end. It gave me a spark of hope, but nothing concrete

However, today was like a beam of light. I was at work again during a 9 hour shift when Rose and Dakota show up to my workplace with two bags of food from a party they’d went to yesterday. I nearly burst out crying when Rose had mentioned there was tres leches- my favorite dessert- in the bag. She told me she loved me and missed me, wanting me to talk to her more. We plan to call tomorrow. After this, an hour later, I called Dakota while working in the lobby cleaning up. This is when a bombshell was dropped that her dad would be OKAY with me moving in. I had to ask her if she was serious, and she was. Plus, I’d be able to bring my cat if I wanted to since I worry for his wellbeing in my current house. I wanted to sob because the love they’ve shown me is incredible, and it’s made me rethink what real love feels like. Rose tells me frequently that she loves me and is proud of me, and how she doesn’t understand my mom. I was also informed by Dakota that I am referred to as “her daughter” by Rose.

- Additionally, my mom seems to be jealous of her. She’ll get eerily quiet whenever I talk about her, and my dad says that she only likes me because “she has no expectations of me”. It makes me uncomfortable when they downplay the people in my life if they aren’t them nor their friends.
	
	

This is where I feel guilty. After the life my parents have given me with all of my belongings and a secure roof over my head and food, I want to abandon them for Dakota’s family. I cannot determine if my mom is truly abusive or if I’m the problem, and I’ve never been able to figure out an exact answer to that. I’ve never been able to go to therapy as my mom said I never had real problems to stress about and that I needed a psychiatrist instead to “figure me out”.  I can’t tell if I’m to blame for some of the things that have happened as I’ve been resistant to her for a few years now. Blame it on being a teenager, but I’m almost an adult. Should I still be hesitant with her?

In short, I have a chance to leave this life behind and move in with Dakota for awhile. I’ve felt at home in their house, while I feel like a stranger and cleaner in my own. I’m worried about college, as I don’t have the funds for it myself, and I wouldn’t have a car. Plus I also worry about my mom seeking me out with malice intent. I need advice as I’m at a standstill for what to do! So Reddit please tell me, am I in the right for wanting to leave my manipulative mom after years of her torment to live with my best friend’s family instead?

[ADD. #1: Should also preface by saying that I have been struggling with undiagnosed issues for years, yet my mom only wants to call me depressed and stresses the importance of a psychiatrist versus a therapist. I’d asked about getting a counselor, and she never followed through finding one. I need help, but I can never receive it adequately, hence why Dakota knows so much about her behavior. Bless her heart for always listening to me ramble!]

[ADD. #2: My mom also has a hard time connecting with her side of her family.  She gets uncomfortable and angry with them a lot, yet they haven’t wronged her (except her own mother). I’d called my aunt one day to tell her about something my mom had done, which was threaten to make me pay rent, and she never realized how bad she was. My mom has .. virtually nobody? I can’t help but feel guilty for likely pushing my aunt away from her, though it gives me a peace if mind to know my aunt would always love me and care for me if my mom didn’t.]"
"While mom is out of state visiting her boyfriend? The mother says it's ok because the oldest is 17, although he is rarely home because he goes to school then works so the 15 year old is basically home alone most of the time. Mom rarely answers her calls and texts when her kids try to get ahold of her when she is out of state with her boyfriend."
"i don’t exactly know how to write a reddit post, because i don’t use it too much except for doom scrolling. for context, i’m 17 and a female with one older sister who has gone through my mothers neglect and abuse. so, starting thursday, i’ve had a nasty cough and had to leave work on friday because my manager heard me coughing and told me i can’t work like that. so since friday, ive had aches and pains all over my body, i’ve been hot and cold at the same time, and i have a little bit of dizziness when im standing. my mom has a history of never taking me to the doctor until the last minute when my sickness is at its worst. well, today, it’s at its worst. i’ve been asking my mom to take me repeatedly since thursday because i’ve been stressed about it. it was always an excuse of “oh i don’t have time,” or “yeah maybe later.” but she hasn’t taken me. what really pisses me off is that she said she didn’t have time to take me but she went to a last minute baseball game tonight that lasted three hours. again, i’m 17, and i don’t have a car at the moment so i can’t exactly get to the hospital myself, and if i can somehow get there, i have no proof of insurance or anything. so what do i do? i’m open to any question or advice, good and bad. thank you for reading.

UPDATE?:

so i don’t exactly know what to do. i’m feeling a little better today, my body isn’t as weak. but she still refuses to take me to the doctor. i followed my boyfriends advice to just kind of nag her until she gives in but that only makes her more angry. she came home after work today, and she was just yelling at me to take medicine and quit complaining. the only medicine we have is old amoxicillin which i was advised not to take if it is not prescribed for whatever i have now. so, yeah. that’s how everything is going. i hope it’s just bad allergies and it’ll be over by thursday so i can go back to work and get her off my ass haha.

update again: 

so it’s tuesday and im feeling fine other than coughing and momentary fatigue (but i also have chronic illness). but she still refuses to take me to a doctor and is now refusing to let me see my boyfriend. i want to get out so bad. i might consider running away to his house."
"TLDR at end
so about 3 years ago, i had this brown sweater that i loved DEARLY and would wear everyday. one day, it disappeared and i could never find it. i looked everywhere in my closet, my wardrobes, under my bed. i asked my mom repeatedly if she knew where it was because she would always tell me it was ugly and i need to stop wearing it. she would always tell me “no” in the most concerned tone and asking if maybe i put it in a garbage bag for her to donate. she would then tell me she would look for it. this would happen time and time again. well, today i was helping her look for my documents needed to take my drivers test and she pulled out the box from her closet and lo and behold.. my brown sweater is in there. i was just so shocked. i was so mad too but i knew i couldn’t be infront of her because then she’d be mad at me. she started laughing and said “i hid it because it was ugly and i was embarrassed for you. everyone would think ‘doesn’t his mom care about him?’” i was honestly just too taken aback to care for her reasoning. i helped her clean her closet back up and then asked for my sweater. she laughed and said she didn’t want to give it to me so i went in and grabbed it. she started berating and laughing at me saying “i hope mice tore it up and it’s ruined” yea, now my sweater has holes in it that it didn’t before and wouldn’t have had, had she not stolen it from me. i took it and said “im still going to wear it like this” i left the room and she started screaming at me and i just kept saying “it sure was such a loving act from you to hide my sweater from me.” (in spanish but it doesn’t translate well) she then started to yell at the top of her lungs until i came back into the room. she then started saying “kill me over a sweater, go into the kitchen and grab a knife and kill me” and whenever i would try to speak she’d interrupt me and say “kill me” i just left the room after saying “are you hearing yourself right now?” am i in the wrong?

TLDR: mom gets mad at me for getting mad at her for hiding my favorite sweater after i said her reasoning of “it was an embarrassing sweater” wasn’t good enough for me and she told me to kill her over it."
"Again, he says it’s for the neighbours but he’s still verbally abusing me out of my own privacy."
"I have had a lot of problems with my aunt before, and I usually tolerated it, but this time feels like the last straw. I live with my aunts because of personal reasons with my sister, so I have been living with them since the pandemic.

I have really bad dust allergies, which cause hives, itchy eyes and skin, and other symptoms. Cleaning is very hard with these symptoms. I wheeze and sneeze, and it makes me feel awful. When I got back from studying abroad, it made sense that my room would accumulate dust, especially given its location. But there's this carpet I hate, it's big, and no matter how much I vacuum it, I know it's still dirty. I rolled it up and placed it outside my room. I didn't destroy or throw it away; I just put it somewhere else.

My aunt always insists that I clean my room, which I get. It's just frustrating that every few hours she tells me to clean my room, especially if I just said good morning and that's the first thing she says. I tried to clean my room, and I immediately got sick. She was well aware of this and asked what was wrong with me. That evening, I moved the carpet as quickly as possible before I passed out.

This morning, when she heard I was awake, my aunt came yelling from the storage area outside my room, ""Where is the carpet?"" (meaning she knew it was gone because she had entered while I was sleeping, again). I said it was behind her. She started yelling at me to return the carpet to the room. I refused and tried to explain my issue, but she began mocking me for stumbling over my words and called me stupid and dirty. She said I was yelling at her, but I wasn't, she was yelling at me. She threatened to call my dad, and I said go for it. I had already told him about my issues, so it wouldn't be a shock. I started calling out her hypocrisy: her room is small because she has too much stuff in it, and the attic is so cluttered it's not even funny.

I'm just frustrated that every time I do something she doesn't like, she starts being mean. Should I just suck it up and put my head down? I'm tired, man."
"So theres this other day, our father asked us to go out buy some herbs,coconuts and something else. But in the end we took 2 hours because my brother took too long in the grocery, i waited outside the store (i'm the driver) and waited for almost 1 hour and 30 minutes. That day, my father's sister was coming home from the airport and before we got home they left to pick up his sister. As we got home we waited for like 3-4 hours, and when they finally came home my father agressively got out his car and smacked my older brother multiple times. I even got blamed for taking too long, but i was only driving and waiting since its my brother who took too long. (I cant tell anymore than this too verbal and)"
"I thought you were the people who were supposed to be there for me? Right? Y'all loved me whenever I was younger, but now there's coldness. You are always so angry and dad hasn't been home in a long time. Maybe this was your  way of punishing me. You won't stop. You CONSTANTLY yell at me for nothing, you say the most awful things a mother could say. I HATE YOU. And sometimes I wish you'd just.. go away. Sometimes we have good moments, but those are rare. You are awful, dear mother. And father, you've hurt me so bad. You have said and done many, many awful things to me. You drink yourself to the grave. You aren't home anymore, because you left. I thought it would be better this way. But it isn't. Nothing has changed . Mom says I'm just like you. Constantly. I strive to be nothing like you. You are a mere liar, more than a father. Now you try being here but it's too late, because you still hurt me in many ways. Neither of you will ever see this, but I wish in some timeline you were different and non- angry and.. cruel. 

From-

Chloe."
"I am 16m. As a kid we were sometimes hit and threatened. Not the normal stuff parents say like threatening to take something away. Or the normal creative threats that black parents say. (I am black and for whatever reason in our culture borderline abuse is normalized). I got threats yelled at me like ""I will break your legs if you move again"". And sometimes they acted on some of these threats. And sometimes my parent would tell me how we are very similar people, we are both charming, and we both are good at taking advantage of others for our personal gain. This stuff has served to make me a liar and a  manipulator with a messed up imagination. I have been lying and manipulating since I was young and have a very bad habit of it. I have gotten very good at it and it is like second nature to me. I lied for stuff as simple as food. I'm not looking for pity. I already know that I am not a great human being. But I am quite honestly afraid of myself. I hate myself for what I am so much. I want to change. I am trying to change. Sometimes it hurts and the guilt weighs heavy on me. At times interacting with other people is extremely difficult too because I am physically incapable of some of the emotions they express and being attached to them because I don't seem to need that connection as much as they do, but I still crave it. It is complicated for me. I come across as cold and I really don't want to be this way anymore. I don't want to hurt people. (I really hope my parent don't find this I have parental controls on my phone)"
"""From a very young age I experienced things no child should have.. and things only got worse when I turned 11.""

""I watched my mother spiral with failed relationships.. loving and leaving each new other mother, one, two, three we’re the most memorable. All while we lived in a small apartment most of my years, eventually, living in the complex lead my mother to spot a new lover. A pregnant woman who lived across the way...""

""This woman gave birth one month after they hooked up, giving me a beautiful baby sister… the only good thing to come from this hell I had been dragged into.""

""She seemed like a nice woman.. but became demanding and harsh as time went on. I took care of her baby while my mother was at work, cleaned house, changed diapers, bathed and fed her child all while her partner slept the day away. But nothing I did was ever good enough. I spoke or breathed the wrong way, spoke in the wrong tone or made a mistake.. I was punished.(Items were confiscated often, I got slapped.) This went on for years.""

""Simple pops in the mouth became slapping across the face(sometimes so hard I got bloody lips), and she often gripped me up by the arms so hard it left bruises. She belittled me and commented on my every mistake. But nothing was ever done no matter who I reached out to… school, trusted family friends.. no one believed me because her word was better than mine.""

""My own mother never believed me even when I begged her to let me stay at her work.. her lover being so manipulative my mom thought I was overreacting this went on for three years 11-14.

I got so scared I began to hold it till the next day.""

""One day I kicked her off of me and that woman called over her sister, who screamed in my face along side her all while I couldn’t do a damn thing but take it. Being called things I didn’t know the meaning of, being degraded.. threatened to be hit by the both of them.. only then did the text to my mother work. She drove over quickly from her job and put a stop to it. But she never left her…""

""The physical abuse went on until I turned 15, that’s when it clicked in my head ‘why am I taking this’. When she slapped me I took it like a champ and told her it didn’t hurt.. being so damn used to being hit and being so emotionally detached I became physically numb to it, even when I saw white with each one. Her slaps became punches, she even tried to strangle me in the hallway once… if I fought back she sat on me (this woman was 220lbs+ and I was only 100lbs) and continued her rampage.""

""I struggled trying not to off myself on a daily basis, the guilt of leaving without explaining holding me back. All while my legs and arms burned against the fabric of my clothes as a result. Still.. not even my therapists and counselors helped me. They only got manipulated like the rest of those I spoke out to by both sides...""

""At the age of 17.. My mother noticed all the abuse.. even the stuff she had missed throughout the 8 years I suffered. But it had been too late.. I was getting older and I was turning 18 soon. On that birthday I almost ended it all. But.. something came up.""

“The shittiest part of it all? The manipulation, the narcissistic abuse, the physical abuse, the rumors that my stepmother told her Friends’ children to get me bullied at school, being maid and nanny, all of it. The only reason my mother finally left her after I turned 18? That pathetic excuse of a person cheated on my mother and that was the last straw.""

""I love my mother.. but she seriously only left because she was cheated on..? After I went through hell on a daily basis.. she left because her trust was finally broken. Was I really not that important?"""
"I (22f) still, unfortunately, live with my mother. It’s me my stepfather, mother, and my older brother 30m (I have 3 brothers and 1 sister). My siblings are 39m 30m 20m and 37f. In short my mother is a major boy mom and coddles my brothers to no end. 
This early afternoon I was walking to the bus stop to head to the gym and 2 cars stopped in the middle of the street. I wasn’t paying attention to the cars because I was walking, I had my headphones on full blast and I was looking at the ground. I look at the ground as I walk because my eye sight isn’t very good and there isn’t any sidewalks where I was walking so I was trying not to fall. As I was walking, I hear a faint sound so I pushed my headphones back off my ears and look up, I see my mother in the second car that stopped. Before I can say anything she yells “oh so you’re just gonna ignore me?!” and speeds off. After she pulls off I stop and text her to clarify that I was not ignoring I simply wasn’t paying attention. She then proceeds to accuse me of ignoring her and said that I know what I was doing and I was being nasty to her. 

She’s accused my sister of doing things to her so eventually my sister picked up and moved states away to get away from my brothers and mother. I’m trying to find a new job so that I can get the hell out of there but I’m having no luck. I am currently employed, I just can’t work often because I’m disabled and I can only make a certain amount before it starts to mess with my benefits.

My mother has always been extremely abusive towards me and my sister. She would punch on me and kick me out. If I try to defend myself in any way she will call my brothers and have them beat on me or threaten me as well. She has stolen my disability checks and got upset when I made myself the payee. If she kicks me out and I don’t come back she would call and harass my friends into telling her where I am and then send my brothers to come get me. 

When I attempted to take my life,  she locked me in the room and had my brothers pin me down for a long period of time. She would listen in on my conversations and when we would have guests she would tell them about my private conversations to get laughs out of them. 

I’m at my wits end…. I’m just tired."
"Since I am 16, that means in the mental health world I am allowed to sign documents without parental permission or whatever. I get to do what I need to do for myself. So recently I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and we talked and he recommended a new antidepressant for me since my other ones were making my anxiety really and. Long story short I said yes, my grandma of course knows because the place I had to get the pills from text her and she gets mad.

When we get home, she starts to get into me asking why I need them and how I don’t even have any problems because my two siblings don’t.

I ended up talking back and telling her that the one thing that heavily affects me is the one big thing she doesn’t believe— my brother SA’ing me/r-wording me. She said if it did happen, we were both young and kids and he was just explorative. I was 6, he was 13. And we got into an argument and she ended up saying she hopes I do get r-worded and then stormed off into her room. She’s 77 and acts more like my age than I do."
"So my dad has been kind of aggressive his whole life. He's been a good dad for most parts, but when he got mad I was just scared of him. It's been like this as long as I can remember. I don't have a lot of childhood memories abt his and mine relationship together, but the ones I do have are bad. So bad I often have nightmares abt them. My best friend knows, but no one else does.  I don't know If I would be able to call my dad abusive, as he can be a really good dad, it's just when he's mad that he gets physically aggressive. He has never straight up punched or beaten me, but he has pulled my hood of my hoodie, making me choke, and done things like grab me really tight and shake me around. He also has lashed out on me on multiple occasions, and then he grabs my arms and forces them in a wrong position, or he just lays his hands on me in a painful way, but not in a way I would call punching me. The problem is that he's never straight up slapped or punched me, but he has hurt me and he has made me afraid of him and his temper. I often stand up against him when he's mad at my sister, making him hurt me so he wouldn't touch my sister. It's been like this as long as I can imagine, and I don't know what to call it. I don't want to call it abuse, bc I know other people have it way, way worse than me, and he's never actually straight up punched or slapped me, but my friend does say it's not normal to be this scared of my father when he gets angry. Does anyone know if this could be a type of abuse, or would it just be called normal, as he is my parent, and kind of like my boss? Also, I might add that bc of his temper and the things he has done to me, my love for him has definitely lessened, and I don't know how to feel abt this as I can't do anything abt it, and I know I actually can't feel this way bc people who actually have an abusive father are still able to see the good in him, and I can't and I think that's my own fault."
"I don't remember much of my childhood because of childhood trauma. I don't bring it up anymore or try to get help because every time CPS comes my parents and sister act like nothing ever happened. And whenever I bring up my grandma's abuse she says it never happened too and everyone else says that too. I have/had bruises all over my body as well as being 70lbs at 5""3"" because my mom constantly body shames me and says that she will put me on a diet and that she doesn't was a fat kid, mind you my BMI was 12.5... TWELVE POINT FIVE! My parents dont allow me to go to the doctors so.... I had to get better on my own. Ive gained alot of weight but my mental state has gotten worse. My dad (step) he hits me, takes my favourite things away for at least six months just for crying ( as he tells me how he wishes i was never born, he wants a better son, im an asshole, and that he's gonna kill me). My parents also lock me out of the house or in the cold dark basement for hours no matter what season. My cousin's touch me and still no one believes me. Is there something wrong with me? Do i deserve all of this? I don't think I can take this anymore. I need help but I'm scared. My only safe place is the hospital or with my friends because they truly care."
"I stopped fighting. I was going through a dark period and I was on the verge of ending it all and I just gave up. I stopped yelling back, I stopped fighting the blatant abuse and comments, I just became a shell of myself. I thought that once I became a target they would push me  to the point of getting the courage to finally leave earth for good. 

Than something really weird happened. They got super angry and more flustered and frustrated then I've ever been able to get them to be or have seen them. They are constantly throwing things my way and the minute I shut down it's like they literally can't comprehend for once that I'm not fighting back. I've become a literal human posseum of just shuting off and ""playing dead"". Now I feel strongly so much better then I have in a long time. It feels like I actually can laugh at stuff and I can exist without feeling totally useless anymore. I know this is probably a super unhealthy way to deal with this, but I just wanted to share and see if anyone else has had this happen? And if so how did it end up for you? "

"I (M30) live overseas and recently had a kid. I was low contact with my mother (F65) and recently reached out to see if she wanted to see her granddaughter. She did. 

She didn’t plan any of it though. My brother M45 booked her flight to Asia and everything. All she had to do was show up and get taken places.

Two days go by and it’s been nonstop bringing up trauma that’s been put to bed. How I went low contact. How I don’t communicate if no one tries to call me back. How I don’t talk to my schizophrenic sister because she doesn’t get help. My mother says the phrase “I don’t understand why we just can’t all get along” all that kind of stuff that I don’t have a word for. 

Then she interrupts our conversations by bringing up more trauma. My wife and I lost a child before our daughter was born. 
We were talking about our daughter’s schedule. When mid sentence my mom interrupts my wife and says “you must be so happy after losing the first one” and she like, meant it to be heartfelt I guess? Idk. We just said, yea but we aren’t talking about that right now. 
An hour later my mom sees me wearing a work shirt and it has my job on it, HAZMAT. Interrupts my conversation with my wife to ask “hazmat what’s that?” I tell her it’s my job, and I’ve told her that for the last 10 years. 
She says “oh I guess I haven’t been paying attention” 
I lost my mind.

I confront her. No yelling no name calling, just plain facts of her treatment towards me. In the middle of this confrontation it somehow becomes about her, and how she was abused by my schizo sister when I left. And how she doesn’t have friends and it’s hard to remember what I do. 
I checked with my brother, the doctors said she doesn’t have any cognitive impairment, she just doesn’t care to know things about me. 
I point out to her that she is either going to admit she doesn’t care and try to change it before my daughter can remember things, or she can get sent pictures of this family that will grow without her. 
Because I definitely do not want my daughter to feel what I felt in those moments. 

My mom said “I’m sorry I can’t remember so good. You are just like your sister.”

Man, I tried to be a good son and make amends too. I don’t think my daughter will get to know her grandma and I hope she doesn’t hate me for it later. "
"I have been been a gentle kid from my childhood, I don't like anyone being rude me nor I like to be rude to anyone, I have always done the best I could in studies, in the relationship with my father and my mother , they were always with me , no matter what I do , and however I performed, After 6th grade though, my mother had stopped doing such things altogether, she would just correct me when I am wrong and is still to day as my friend, she is very support and understanding, while my father , since that time has been more and more abusive and ranting, I know I didn't cleared the hostel school exams , I didn't want to , I didn't knew anything about them , nor did I really wanted to go anywhere, Even though all of this , I still did my best , and According to most people that's what matters right, not to him , every time , if I only score 90% then , that 90% is earned by me , I am happy with it , I don't want anything more and anything less than i work for , I don't want to meet any unrealistic expectations that he has.
Any day , when he sees me watching my phone , even though my youtube screen time is less than 1/2 hour , nor do I go play outside, nor do I watch sports or movies on the TV , anything I do exept studying triggers him , if I draw and sketch to relieve my stree , he still interrupts and scolds me with cuss words , at every result he has the same sentence to say to my teachers , even though all of them says I good at studying,"" He's just on his phone all day and doesn't study "" , like ok , if that was the case who tf watches youtube all day and still is a high performer , man each day I am feeling mentally exhausted , yesterday I was crying on my table because of it .
Everything hurts , I dont want to even live in this family, its just that my mother is so caring, I can't imagine her when she hears that I have hung myself or something, she is the only motivation I have.
Please suggest me anything you may.... "
"14F. since i was little my moms displayed emotionally and physically abusive behaviour. however she alot of the time genuinely acts like a caring mom. she will feed me, hug me, kiss me. try ""comfort me"" and now i just reject it all , i rebel as much as i can. i dont do what she asks. i just feel angry around her but then i feel copious guilt whenever i do. shes pregnant right now and that makes me feel worse for being mad at her. she hasnt taught me to do many chores and im struggling with my health so all ive been doing is sitting on my PC all day. like always. she does everything but then she screams that i dont do anything even though i genuinely dont know when and how to do some of the stuff. she always tells me when to shower and how disgusting i am but she didnt teach me proper hygeine either and its genuinely hard to catch on.  i can wash dishes and clean my room sure. but thats all. she complains that she does everything and i press her to rest sometimes and even now.  i get mad when she lies to me like example

when i was really little i listened to her and stayed silent when she screamed. i cried of course but i stayed silent when she was hitting or arguing with me or my other family. but now im rebelling and trying to make her feel what i do but why do i feel so much guilt? especially because as soon as she asks me to do something or comes in my room i want her to leave and tell her to get out or scream at her.

she comes in telling me i still have tuition this week even though she told me i wouldnt during summer. it just triggered me so much and i kept telling her to get out and stop lying to me all the time.

i want to behave because i feel like a horrible daughter and i still love her and feel guilt .

i dont like going out with her or her coming into my room to tell me to get off my pc or clean my room. i always tell her to get out and rebel. i feel like the abuse isnt abuse and its my fault she acts the way she does soemtimes.

i feel like a spoiled ignorant brat. i hate myself.

she told me she was pregnant and were moving house outside london and moving schools. i cant deal with all of this. shes so horrible yet so kind

i feel like im mocking abuse because theres people who have it worst. she actts like a normal mom  mostly and alot of the time its my reactions that start fights or arguments. when we argue i argue back and scream. she hits and screams too.

its all my fault."
"(F16) Hi, my nn is naya and g11 na ko sa pasukan. Tbh, idk how to start this because I've never thought of sharing this sa mga socmed ko kasi parang nakakahiya. So deal with me na lang po hehehe, so I'm the eldest daughter and I have a younger bro, 6y/o and may special needs siya. So sila mama and si anes (let's call him 'anes' cuz ayoko siyang tawagin in any term kasi di niya deserve yung role na yun sa family namin) dati noon parehas silang may work, tumigil lang si anes para raw ""alagaan"" ako. Then unexpectedly, after 10 years nagkaroon ako ng kapatid so bc of it yun yung parang naging reason niya kung bakit ayaw niya magwork. 

So lagi in our daily lives, kaming tatlo lang ni anes ang nasa bahay cuz nasa work si mama lagi tues-sat, or minsan meron din sa mon half day lng nmn, kaya most of the time kaming 3 lng kapag wala akong pasok sa school, kapag meron 2 sila.
Ngayon, di ko siya magawang ikwento tbh kasi sobrang dami ng scenarios na abusado siya lalo na pag walang nakatingin, and honestly, kahit may nakatingin ganun pa rin siya. And from what I mean na may ""nakatingin"" yung mga relatives namin yun. Kasi nakatira kami sa parang isang family compound kaya lahat na sila rito alam na ugali niya (kahit nung bata pala siya). 

There's always this scenario na kapag gugupitan niya ng buhok kapatid ko nasa labas kami ng bahay so makikita ofc ng mga relatives namin, parang abnormal si anes tbh. Kasi yung kapatid ko ayaw niya yung ginugupitan siya ng hair, lalo na pag may razor takot siya sa vibration nun, so ayun bali nagccause ng iyak niya. Eh ito naman si anes sasabayan din ng pagiging isip bata, papatulan niya like for ex. sasampalin. And di ko maiwasang di mairita kasi di ko yun ginagawa sa kapatid ko kasi naiintindihan ko ung situation niya at mahiya na rin kasi ang daming nakakarinig sa mga pinagsasabi niya na masasama about sa kapatid ko. 

If you're asking kung may alam si mama, yes may alam siya. ALAM NA ALAM NIYA, di siya sinasaktan pero sinisimot naman lagi yung sweldo niya. Ang laging reason ni anes is para raw sa bahay ganto ganyan, lahat ng mga bayarin at walang kwenta niyang mga gamit, si mama ang gumagastos. Samantalang si anes, may pera naman siya galing sa kakahingi di malabas. Kapag sinabihan siya ni mama na siya naman magtrabaho, na-ooffend agad tas kaming magkapatid ang lagi niyang excuse kuno ""walang magbabantay sa kanila"". tangina mo. Kung di lang mataas pride ni anes di siya paplastikin ng mga nasa paligid niya lalo na mga relatives namin dito, he's the type of person din na matalino sana kaso ang taas ng tingin sa sarili wala naman naabot sa buhay puro lang pangarap. Kapag may kausap na ibang tao yan, pakitang tao lang yan, kunwari mabait pero yung totoo pwede ng palitan si satanas. 

Sa akin naman, ako ang punching bag. So ganto kasi yun, yung lola ko which is yung mother niya, abusive sa kanilang magkakapatid din nung bata pa sila, ngayon nung medyo nagka-isip na si anes, may iisa silang kapatid na babae, which is dun niya parang nilalabas yung frustration niya sa mama nila, sabi ni tita, lagi raw yun binabanatan siya kahit wala naman siyang ginagawa. Tapos, nabuntis kasi yung tita ko noon sa panganay sa aming magpipinsan, ngayon nalaman ng mama nila kaya ang ginawa pinapunta si tita ko sa ibang lugar para nga di malaman ni anes kasi nga pag nalaman, yare na. Tbh, di ko na alam yung sunod nun, but I feel like gusto pa rin siyang saktan ni anes after malaman na buntis nga siya di lang magawa. 

Hanggang ngayon, ganun pa rin siya sa amin, walang pagbabago kahit ilang beses akong magsabi sa mga lola ko, wala talaga. Kasi di siya nakikinig, tingin niya kasi tama lang na manakit as a way of discipline, TANGINA KA. Di na ko naaawa sa sarili ko, pati na rin kay mama at sa kapatid ko, kasi kung hindi siya mawawala, parang ganun na lang paulit-ulit na lang yung mga mangyayari. So please, I'm asking if pwede bang ipakulong toh"
"All of my life my mom has worked her hardest and got us away from her very abusive ex's (brothers dad) and we ended up at my grandmother's house when I was 10 the house hold was me, my mom, cousin f14, cousin m10 and ofc my brother. Now time to introduce our villain, mom, mom hates her life mom has depression mom blames her problems on her kids mom beats us with items until we would bleed (sometimes) mom has a power complex, ""op why haven't you called de fax"" well I'm glad you asked well it's bc my grandmother can't support us on her own, well that was the case 7 years ago now our house hold consists of me(17), mom(41), brother(11),cousin f (20), cousin's gf (21) and that's it well mom Changed for the worst instead of getting better she now downs in beer and liquor almost every night and in the morning she wakes up gets dressed drinks liquor gets in the car and drives and she never pays her rent to my COUSIN F (20) BC MY COUSIN OWNS THE HOUSE due to my mother's lack of common sense to not beat her kids! And I have stood up to my mother she's 5'4 270 lbs I'm 
5'9 200lbs and most of that is muscle but I'd never lay my hands on her no matter what she does to me idk why but I never let her hit my brother hard not like she did to me (I take the hits for him) honestly I'm so lost on what to do one minute she's fine and funny the next she's beating me with glass bottles "
"I haven't spoken to him in a long time and I was able to get out of his apartment 6 months ago but for some reason he REFUSES to give up *any* control/power he still has over me. it's frustrating as hell, I just want him completely out of my life. When he went to the bank to set up a bank account for my little brother he removed my mom from having control over my bank account so now it's just him and me, I know he goes through it, why? I have no idea. Me and my mom went to the bank last week to try to remove him and add her to my bank account but they said he signed legal documents so we can't remove him. I can't even fucking go to the dentist because there's no dentist in my town and we've gotta take a flight to go, he has good health insurance since he works for the government and he gets free medical/dental travel, my mom is still on his insurance but  he won't let her take me. I live in a town of mostly natives and my mom can't get free dental travel because she's white, they get 100% free, this is unrelated to my dad but it pisses me tf off, they say racism is the worst thing ever but are EXTREMELY racist to anyone who isn't native (especially white people) I've been bullied my whole life just for being white😐. *Anyways*, I need advice. He refuses to give up custody of me (he technically still has half custody of me but I get panic attacks every time I go there so my mom just let me live with her full time.) I don't know why, it's so frustrating. I just want to be rid of him."
"i’ve been dealing with an abusive mom my whole life. she and my dad divorced after years of her cheating (they were married for one year before she started, for context), and has been taking it out on me since.

it’s a long story, but to put things into perspective, she didn’t give the relationship a chance. my dad worked three jobs to support us, as i was born with a birth defect and medical bills were costly before they finally gave me insurance because it would never be fixed. according to her, this was too much—they never got intimate and i guess she really couldn’t wait.

since i can remember, i’ve met countless men and have been forced to stay with them while she does whatever she wants. i lied to my dad my whole childhood and he definitely took it out on me. i’d get in trouble at school (bad grades because of the birth defect, which ended up leaving me mostly blind), and he’d jump on my ass and beat me to the ground. living with his isn’t an option. every time i ask, his wife and her kids tell him no. i have nowhere to go.

i’m 20 now, heading off to university soon to finish my last two years as a transfer.. i can’t keep doing this. i feel bad sometimes, like really, really bad, to hate her so much, but just today she offered to get me a few groceries because she didn’t get me anything the last time she went. instead, she bought a bunch of meat for the guy she’s seeing, and it sits there because he doesn’t come over. in the span of a few hours, i took a nap and she came home and i didn’t respond right away. she’s been ignoring me since. she does this all the time. i try really hard to let it go and ignore her. i hear it’s called “gray walling” or something, like letting a person who’s narcissistic just talk to themselves so they feel better, but it’s hard because i don’t have anywhere to go until school and she threatens me constantly to kick me out.

i’m disabled, my vision won’t ever get better, and i truly feel that she uses it to her advantage. i can’t say or do anything she doesn’t like. i’m afraid that the money i just spent to order the groceries she told me to get is going to be wasted. i had to doordash for dinner and i’ve been spending money for school, so i won’t have anything let to be able to survive on. the $1,000 i had was from a program for school, and she only let me participate so she wouldn’t have to spend money on me.

she may not go pick them up and my dad is pretty absent, i get a call and visit every now and then after he got remarried and the wife has younger kids. i’m mostly fine, i’ve hardened because of it all, but i just feel like i blow things out of proportion sometimes. crying over it feels so soft when i know that nothing will change. i can’t help but have hope even though i KNOW better.

she got me like $300 worth of stuff for graduation this past spring, and she’s pretty much bought everything for college for my dorm, but then she does small stuff like tonight and other times and i feel fucking dumb. i tell myself to not talk to her unless i absolutely have to, and then the very next day i’m trying to show her something funny i found. i feel like it’s majorly just.. yknow, wanting a mom, especially cause i have to live with her, but i know better. it fucking sucks. they’re going on vacation, that’s the only reason i could get the groceries. she doesn’t even care to invite me. the last “vacation” we had was a school orientation that we had to travel for. i feel so resented. a man who disrespects her constantly has more respect than me.

she constantly talks on the phone at max volume reminding everyone how excited she is for me to leave. we live on the third floor of our apartment building and every time we go shopping, she reminds me of how excited she is to not have to buy groceries and carry them up the stairs anymore. there was a first floor available, but god forbid anyone make any noise.

she’s a classic karen, too. we got food yesterday and the worker asked the typical question of “do you want to round for XYZ” and she felt it was necessary to yell at the girl for it. it’s not just to me, but i definitely think i get the worst of it. the guy(s) she gets with get it bad too.. i don’t understand how a meal and vacations are enough to make them stay, because i know they don’t love her.

it feels like everything she does is her fault and i can’t tell her that. she’s mad about the dishes but won’t ever get the guy to wash them after cooking him a five-star meal. i leave one bowl, washed and just sitting there because i forgot to put it away, and she screams at me when i try to justify what i did.

working is the absolute worst thing to her. she has a good job and quits because it requires a little bit of labor. i fear we’ll end of homeless sometimes with how hard she tries to avoid bills and taxes. we don’t need food stamps or food banks but she applies to everything. we aren’t poor at all.

i honestly fear for my life sometimes. she’ll tell me she’ll choke me if she sees something happen again. i know they’re mostly empty threats, but it worries me a lot.

i’m worried that school won’t even be an escape enough from her. i want to change my number after i graduate and just disappear. she never put hands on me other than smothering me and hitting me a few times, and i think that’s why i’m so hesitant to feel like a victim cause people literally get killed, but still. i don’t get it."
"If you're ready to help a newly-turned adult with hoisehold abuse, please read, or else  the title is enough.

Im an undergraduate (sayin' this to not state my age), so I still live with my parents.

These parents are disgustingly abusive.

This has been going on for almost 6 years since I was a kid, and idk what to do.

I've tried shouting back, fighting back when they fight me physically, or sometmes not replying or only saying rightful stuff whilst being respectful.

It used to be physical and emotional abuse, and when I grew up, it became only emotional (wow). 

Typical narcissistic mom & dad, curse words, abuse,etc. (for example if i go to the kktchen and try microwaving my lunch they try to stop me and threaten me or they turn off wifi, etc.  -- IK THESE SOUNDS CHILDISH BUT THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG I DON'T WANT TO GO DEEP)

They also sometimes try to record me voice/video to make me scared.

I can't even stand up for myself without getting cursed at, and they always threaten me with these types of punishments...

I've tried everything and developed many mental illnesses bcz of them....

It's way worse than it sounds. Trust me, I just can't put everything they did in one post.

I'm looking for **ANY** type of help or even words of support.

Thanks."
I was adopted when I was a baby and only knew my dad as my dad. Today he just told me in rage that he feels like a stepdad. I’m deeply hurt. I will never forget that and I will see him in a new light.He knows how to hurt people.
"i’m so angry i could scream, im so tired  don’t even know where to begin. My life is not my own and everyday that passes it gets worse. I live in a prison that plays the sounds of nails against a chalkboard on loop and the only person that can stop it plays their own music. IT WAS JUST TWO DAYS AGO, where in a driving lesson with my dad i broke down and he told me he would try to change to keep things short it started off with him saying i was PURPOSELY making mistakes on the road just to piss him off in which i replied who does that i’m trying, i told him you’ve been controlling my life for ages and now i have no clue what i want to do now im 18 because im so used to doing what someone else wants he’s messed up my future. Going out to be with friends always has to have a fight before it ALWAYS. he said he’d change, how stupid of me to believe he would 


had been planning on seeing friends i know i wont see for a while today for a week, planned to go this morning but he went on a long rant saying he doesn’t want me to go i should stay because i went out everyday this week. It’s friday. i was home monday and Tuesday. went to cinema wednesday afternoon. and work yesterday. ITS SUMMER HOLIDAY and i worked extremely hard during my exams i deserve to have fun i deserve to make my own choices i didn’t end up going because i stupidly let him guilt me. and if you read my other threads i know exactly how it goes when i come back and mentally i cannot deal with that. 

for the first time in a while i broke down my life is utterly and completely controlled and my mum who disagrees with his behaviour allows him to do whatever she wants. from another viewpoint believe me when i say i emphasise with her but as her daughter God i am so so so betrayed by her. why can’t she protect me as her mother why has she let him control this family. my last summer before i go off to uni and i fear i will lose friendships because of this man.

All of this due to repeated traumatic events i kept burying until it manifested as seizures. The plan was to get better mentally then enter the workforce again. Mother doesn't like that.

If I don't go to college (I don't want to), I'm going to get kicked out and put into subsidized housing. I have been threatened by this twice. I'm 20. I have other disabilities besides this. I'm told constantly to just ""get over it"". Part of the reason I don't want to go to college is because I don't want another thing she can hold over my head. 

I'm not fucking sitting here doing nothing. I literally had a psychiatrist appointment today and I go out and see friends regularly (she screamed at me that I'm agorphobic because I don't want to go out and do things with her for obvious reasons). I have been out of work for only a month. I applied for ssi the day I quit. I do everything she asks to help around the house. I do my own thing and stay away from her. I paid rent when i was working. I pay my own medical bills still. I hate this fucking house and I wouldn't be here if I had a choice. I literally wanted to move out at 15. 

I'm just starting to get better and I can't handle college. I don't even know what I want to do. My life revolves around pleasing her because if I don't it's constant verbal abuse, threats and its escalated to physical abuse before. I had a suicide attempt a month ago and didn't even tell her because all she'd do is make it worse (I've attempted in the past and she made it all about her. Screaming at me in the ER saying shit like I only took x amount of pills for attention vs actually wanting to die). 

I hate it here, I hate her, I hate living. "
"Badly phrased, but I’m 20 (afab) and about to be a college senior. My dad keeps telling me I’m behaving badly and that I’m lazy because I don’t have a job, sitting around all day, and is threatening to take away my electronics, etc. I’ve applied to over 20 places for a summer internship in hopes of staying away from home. I’ve also applied for an on campus job so I can make money. The ones I’ve heard back from rejected me and the rest I’ve never heard back. I’m worried that I won’t have a future and that I’ll have to move back home with him once I graduate. I don’t know what direction I want to go in life but I feel pressured to figure everything out.

When does one even have everything figured out? Am I supposed to have everything figured out by now? Ideally, just want to move far away and go no contact. I can’t stay with either of my parents because my dad is verbally, emotionally, and borderline physically abusive. He’s done things such as yelled at me for not organizing a bookcase to his liking, making food at 12am (ramen) even though he told me I could since we didn’t have much in the house. Every so often he’ll poke, shove, jab me as a joke; even earlier he hit my eye and laughed it off when I told him it hurt.

My mom is equally as bad, asking me for money (usually $40+) for things I don’t know about. She told me once I get a job I’d have to help her pay rent. I don’t even have a room of my own where she lives. I had to share her bed with her when I fled from my dad’s.

TLDR: at what age are you supposed to have everything figured out? What kind of jobs should I be applying/looking for that require little to no experience? How did you leave your parents? Or if you haven’t, how have you survived?"
"I grew up in a household that valued chores above everything else. my chores were to wash the dishes (starting at 4th grade), and to help out with weekly deep clean of the house. my father was always angry at us (me and my younger brother) for not doing the chores on time, so as time went on, he started to give us more chores as punishment for not doing the chores we already had to do. by 7th grade, my father got tired of me not washing the dishes on time, so cooking dinner for the family also became my chore. with the Saturday cleaning, he got tired of us constantly fighting over who does what, so that also became me and my brother's chore. he was a stay at home dad, but most if not all chores were done by me and my siblings. we never got allowances for doing them, it was either you complete them by the time limit, or you don't get to live in the house. consequences for not doing chores were being locked out of the house (sometimes over night), sitting on our knees for extended amount of time, spanking (with or without objects), and other corporal punishments. my parents made it very clear that if the chores weren't done on time, I would be facing the consequences. even then, I would not obey by their rules. I would get very upset at the thought of having to do them and would avoid doing the chore until I got in trouble. after a certain point,  I never understood even as a child why I felt so strongly against doing the chores. now as an adult (20) who lives alone, I enjoy doing chores. since I live alone, there is no time limit for when I have to complete them by, and to be honest I do struggle to do them at times, but they still get done at some point. how do other parents teach kids to do chores? bc the way my parents did it obviously doesn't work."
"I'm freaking out.

I (28f) have been living with my mom (77) since I graduated from college, and it looks like there's no way for me to get out without severing our relationship completely. She always tells me things about how she has no confidence in me, she doesn't trust me, she doesn't believe I have the ability to be out on my own without her. But when I'm in her home, there are rules that I feel like people who are almost 29 shouldn't have to deal with. 

Any time I leave the house, she needs to know where I'm going, who I'm with, and what time I'll be home. She says I'm required to answer the phone any time she calls me when I'm at work (even if I'm meeting with my boss or helping a customer). She comes into my bedroom in the middle of the night to talk to (yell at) me.

She says that she's protecting me and teaching me how the world works and that I'm not allowed to make decisions on my own. When I say that I want to go out on my own and live on my own, she says that I can't, and that if I do, she'll never help me or be there for me for anything again.

She screams at me every day, mocks me, and has called me names. The only thing she hasn't done is cause me physical harm. I know it's all manipulation tactics and such, but it's getting into my head so badly that my work is getting disrupted, I am exhausted all the time, and I am living in a pretty consistent state of anxiety.

I see a therapist and am working through it with her, but she's starting to go so far as to ask what I talk about in my therapy sessions, and when I once mentioned that I talked about her, she lost her mind and said that I couldn't talk about her.

Anyway, thanks for listening. I just felt like I really needed to vent because I'm starting to get at my wits end and I don't know what to do anymore."
"My dad was an absolute monster towards me and my family growing up and till my mom divorced him. We left the day he kicked us out and once he left the house we came back to change locks and found a whole potential murder scene waiting for us if we decided to come back when he was begging my mom to come home. 

It’s been since 2019 since then and last time I saw him was in court when my little brother passed away and my dad was trying to get rights over what to do with his remains even though he hadn’t seen my brother once when he was alive after my parents split or even talked to him.

I see now that he’s just living his life he looks happy he has a new girlfriend and it just EATS away at my soul to know that he can just live a normal life knowing what he did to me and my siblings even my mom. So sometimes I just can’t help myself but comment on pics of him and his new girlfriend and just say the absolute horrible shit he’s done and the hell he’s caused I just don’t ever want him to be happy. Especially since she has kids it’s like he starting over with a brand new family it just honestly kills me."
"I’m 23 years old and I live with my Mom. It’s just us two as my parents divorced when I was a kid and my brother moved out. My dad lives in a different city and so does my brother so I don’t see them much; my mom has always been verbally abusive, she used to get physical but when I was about 15 she stopped. Since then she has hit me a couple of times but I always forgave her. The thing is she is very manipulative and she is always yelling and insulting me. I have learned to ignore her over the years but sometimes I explode and yell back. Another thing is that she shields her abuse behind the fact that she is “just asking me to clean up” but what bothers me is not the cleaning part but how she insults me and manipulates me while I do it. Today I had my first day of a job and she wouldn’t let me go because she wanted me to clean somethings around the house. While I was cleaning she kept shouting at me and hit me in the back twice. I exploded then and yelled at her to get out of my house (it’s my dad’s house) and told her to never put a hand on me again. I tried to leave but she backed me into a corner and hit me in the mouth. She didn’t hit me very hard but hard enough to leave a scratch on my face. Then I snapped and slapped her in the face. I feel very bad about it and can’t stop crying. After that I just ran out of the house and left in my car. My mom bought that car for me and she told me that she wants it back. I really need that car and without it I can’t go to school or work. I don’t know what to do about the situation, any suggestions or advice is appreciated. "
"TW: child abuse, description of an act of violence against a teenager 

I’m in my 40’s now and I have, for the most part, moved past and have gotten over the majority of the abuse I received from my stepfather when I was a teenager. For reasons that I’m not going to get into, me becoming a teenager and going through puberty caused a huge shift in my stepfather’s behavior. This man started to absolutely hate me. And I can honestly say, for the most part, I was not a bad kid. And I did not deserve the things he did to me. 

One day when I was 15, my mom was in the hospital (she has congestive heart failure as well a congenital birth defect in her heart and she’s been hospitalized more times than I can count) I absolutely *hated* the times she wasn’t there because there was no one to intervene on my behalf when my stepfather would undoubtedly get pissed at me for whatever I did or didn’t do that day. 

This particular day I was cleaning my room and I decided to rearrange my bedroom furniture while I was at it. Well that was a terrible idea because I got my ass handed to me for not asking his permission to rearrange my furniture. 

Which turned into this circular argument of him asking me why I didn’t ask his permission and me saying that I didn’t think I had to, and he would just keep asking me the same thing and getting angrier and angrier every time he asked me. And after like the dozenth time of being asked why I didn’t ask his permission, I got angry and yelled “I didn’t fucking think I had to!” 

Well that was the wrong damn thing to do because he then grabbed me by the throat, slammed me up against the back door and started choking me. I’m not embarrassed to admit that I actually pissed myself. Because I could not breathe and I was absolutely terrified. 

Which brings me to the statistic I mentioned in the title. Apparently if you are strangled by someone, there is a 750% increased risk of that person killing you within a year. 

750%. That’s absolutely terrifying. 

And honestly, I can see that there was indeed a high chance that that could have happened. Because he had a shotgun in the closet upstairs and when he was on a yelling tirade, one of the things he used to say constantly was how “one of these days I’m gonna snap! And I promise you, when I do, I’m gonna get that gun and I’m taking everybody out with me!” 

He absolutely would have fit the profile of the “family annihilator”. 

That was the last time he put his hands on me and that’s only because I packed a suitcase and ran away. Became an emancipated minor.

One last story about him: when I was 17, my mom asked me to come over for Christmas, just to stay for like an hour to open presents. So he called the cops on me. Tried to get me arrested for “trespassing”. Cops made him feel like shit because of the absolute assholery of this and because my mom also owns the house, and she invited me, so there was no “trespassing” even happening. 

So, thanks if you read this whole novel. If you’re a victim of a parent strangling you, please please remember the statistic and get out as soon as possible. Your life is legitimately in danger."
does like anyone else get bad panic attacks hearing your abusive parent(s) walking towards your room last night i was at my dads just talkin w friends on discord slowy falling asleep at one point i had drifted asleep and heard my dads footsteps and woke up and started crying and shaking bad but he never came near where i was asleep it took me an hour to calm down with the help off friends im assuming this isnt just me but does anyone else experience this?
"recently my dad had just been excused from jail a couple weeks ago. this was his first time getting an offense for dv so after like a couple days he got out and he was back home again. he never stopped drinking but he said he was afraid of going to jail and all of that stuff. he has a trail on the 29th again and i don’t really have a clue what’s going to happen because we thought he was done. 

we also got kicked out of our house because our landlord found out police got involved and he doesn’t like that. so now we found a new apartment which we still have to live with him, and he was angry because we didn’t throw away everything already but we still needed some things because we’re not leaving yet. due to the fact that our neighbors would get involved again, instead of yelling and of that he started throwing everything he saw into trash bags including my moms clothes and medicine she needs refrigerated for her diabetes and stuff. 

i just feel frustrated because i’m not able to share anything in court since i guess it wasn’t my case. but i’ve witnessed everything unfold since i was 3 and i’m the only one stuck living with them. i’m sort of desensitized to this, but i can’t help but feel frustrated. my mom and i were able to rent a room last year without him but she went back to him behind my back lol. when i got in the car to go back to where we left, he still tried to talk to me and saying sorry but mockingly."
"**I'll try to keep this story nice and short but to start off my early childhood was not the best.**

Me and my brother were raised in a single mother household probably because of how horrible our mom was and my half brother spared all the trauma by luckily living at his dads.

But we were beat for the pettiest things at home like getting *one* question wrong on our homework and we'd be punished severely like dipping our fingers in *boiling hot* water or throwing us across the room and kicking our stomachs repeatedly. THIS in itself was *bad* enough but I don't wanna get into all of it.

As we grew into early adolescence the physical abuse lessened and we got the opportunity to move in with our *first*stepdad I believe he was kind of nice although that wouldn't stop my mother from controlling primarily me at that point and turning me against him as she *alienated* me from him (something I've come to see quite a bit lmao) and getting her own house again.

There was still a lot of unsolved trauma though between me and my little brother (overall in the entire family) we didn't have the best relationship even to this day because our mother pitted us against each other numerous times.

Things were quiet for some reason during this period none of us talked to each other just very disconnected but I partially managed to fix things with my brothers again.

Now in my middle adolescence things are heating up again with yet another one of her boyfriends (who's obviously immature and incapable) but the thing is every man she dates gets worse (literally a month ago her boyfriend flashed my little brother) and moved out his house after we just moved in now letting him stay at our house?? WTF but its like she's finding the perfect deranged mother fucker to collide with and torment her own children.

I can't recall much from my past but can remember things years ago from school because at home chaos brews hell fire with the doors locked from the public eye. (my mother has taken away all of my things before but i've been playing it safe now)"
"Just a warning this is a long post

I am a 16 year old girl, I have a 12 year old sister, cute little dog and I live with both my parents. Seems like the perfect family right? Well it pretty much is for everyone except for me. My relationship with my mom is complicated to say the least. My sister is a travel softball player and my parents whole world has been softball since my sister started playing little league. My point is my sister is 1000% the favorite. Anyways… my mom gets mad at me for everything I do and I never know how to make her happy. I can’t have a conversation with her without it turning into an argument. She used to make me absolutely hate myself. The past couple years I have spent more and more time away from home just to avoid her. I stay at my boyfriends house for as long as I can everyday (sleep at home tho). I see things online about not keeping people in your life that bring you down but what do you do when it’s impossible to leave them behind. I’m stuck with my family until I’m 18. I even stay at home some days hoping to spend time with them to make them happy but they don’t even acknowledge that I’m there. We will be siting right next to each other and they don’t say anything and if they do its something about softball. Like if you want me there then make me feel welcome and loved. Do I have to be the bigger person? Idk what to say. Nobody even suspects a thing besides my boyfriend and his parents. I can’t go to therapy because I can’t pay and I would get yelled at for it. I also think I have ADHD so I went to the doctor to get diagnosed. If you know anything abt it, it’s a survey. I got the papers to give to my teachers and whatnot and….my mom stole them and hid them from me. She says I’m doing it for attention just like everything else. She makes me feel guilty about everything. My boyfriend will tell me that she is abusive but I think I don’t want to except that reality bc she’s my mother. She makes me feel like absolute shit but I don’t wanna except that she’s abusive. So is she?"
"my mom was very abusive towards me in childhood, and i used to wish every day that she would love me and that id stop messing up (she would scream and get mad at me for what i used to think were my fault, but were actually things that didn’t really matter, like me spilling rice, not liking her recent instagram posts quickly enough, forgetting something inside the house and having to walk back in to get it). They would be really angry outbursts and i wondered why all my friends got to have relationships with their moms, while i always had to walk on eggshells at home. my dad wasn’t home a lot because of work. He was usually nice when he was home in childhood and he never knew about my mom’s actions towards me.

the day after i moved to college, my mom became super nice. she buys me things and is levelheaded. it’s like she’s a completely different person. She’s the mom i prayed for every night as a kid, but she’s too late. The night before college, she got really mad at me and said i drove her crazy and her eyes darkened and she got mad at me like she always has. It’s like a complete switch. I know she’s nice now and she’s been nice for a year, but i hate her. I can’t talk and i shut down in front of her, so even if im talking with my dad, if she’s in the room, i talk very curtly, which i try to fix but honestly i don’t feel comfortable expressing myself in front of her. It’s ruining my relationship w my dad. We have our own issues, he is honestly kind of an asshole sometimes but i still love him. But we still have some tensions sometimes bc he’s so stubborn and he also hates when i get emotional but i don’t hate him for it.

honestly im just confused. I don’t understand why i had to go through that, and it’s hard to confront the fact that the abuse didn’t make me more unique or special or teach me lessons, it just happened and now it’s hard for me to live happily or express myself. Meanwhile many of my friends have learned to be confident and are growing into well rounded and amazing young adults, coming from loving households. No one i know understands this situation or having abusive parents. My dad had an abusive dad, and now he is married to an abusive mom unknowingly. It’s just a lot for me to process. I am not close to either parent because of the effect the abuse had on my interactions with everyone in my life. What can i do? How can i move forward? How can i have a relationship with my parents, even though I honestly don’t want one?

"So im a 13 year old living in canada, we’ve just moved a few weeks ago after leaving the Philippines. But when i was young my mom and dad were super abusive to me at a young age, when i was 6 my parents used to beat me or hit me if i did something “wrong” and by wrong it means doing what they don’t like. When i was 10 i frequently go to my grandma’s house alot since i was raised there, my grandma and my uncle were the only ones kind to me, but now its only my uncle who’s living, my grandma passed away in 2023 so i can’t go to her (her grave is left in the Philippines) I am the oldest to my 3 siblings. My brothers (12yrs and 1 yr) and sister (3 months) are also victim to this abuse, my parents would sometimes hit them, and it has affected my eldest brother. He has became moody, rude and helpless. But i am also facing homophobia in my family. I am 1 out of some of my relatives to be a homosexual, the rest are homophobic. So i have a secret monster high doll in my bag because i bought it for myself, if my parents saw it they said they will deport me to the Philippines. So i am hiding my homosexuality. Thats my story as a gay non-binary 13 yr old"
"For context, I have recently found out(48 hours recently)my mom is narcissistic, manipulative, gaslighting, and is emotionally/mentally abusive and my body is physically reacting(having more panic attacks, crying more, stomach hurting, etc.). I think I’ve always known this but, as I’ve read, I may have been justifying her behavior cause she’s family and she has her own trauma and mental issues/disabilities. I am diagnosed with a few mental issues/disabilities as well and I behave similarly, but I 90% sure it's learned behavior, I’m not actually narcissistic, manipulative, etc. I’m planning on moving out and both my mom’s and dad’s side of my family, more so my mom’s side, is going to ask for more info and details. Do I tell them truth or heal myself first and the later down the line tell the truth? I don't know if anyone will believe me, especially my mom's side, she already has problems of her own. I think, and I can't confirm or deny this, she has family and religious trauma(My mom side are Mormons), my immediate family don't practice anymore. If anyone has some advice or tips would be greatly appreciated and  don't worry I have family member I can trust and get support from during my move, I also have a therapist appointment, so I am going to get the professional help I need as well. If your still here, thanks for reading this paragraph of a story :-) <3"
"I, M20, still live at home with mom and her bf while I pursue my 2nd associates degree.  My parents got divorced when I was 14.  Overall, growing up was not ideal, my father was physically and verbally abusive as well as an alcoholic and my mom not much better just more verbally abusive, although she has laid hands on me and my youngest sister a couple times.  My 2 older sisters and my grandparents practically raised me throughout the years.  My parents got divorced because they both cheated on each other, the man my mom is with is the man she cheated on my dad with, so there’s some resentment there to begin with.  
I currently am little to no contact with my dad due to actions post-divorce that I simply cannot forgive. During the custody talks, i basically was met with a decision of choosing the lesser of two evils when it came to who I wanted to live with, so I ultimately chose my mother.  During the divorce, my mom paid no mind to me, she cared more about getting child support out of my dad as well as appeasing her new boyfriend, she posted about it publicly on Facebook and garnered sympathy, the only person that ever checked on me was my oldest sister, I admittedly still am not over the divorce because I feel as though I never got any form of closure. From that point to now, my mom has been one of the most shallow people I’ve ever known in my life, even more than when she was with my dad, she makes me feel like a burden to her as well defending her bf’s questionable actions.  I believe him to be a carbon copy of my dad.  My mom has defended him when he was made downright awful statements, sexual in nature toward my sisters as well as girls that I brought over in the 6 years I’ve known him. I recall a time my mom telling me, “I wish I met (bf) earlier on, that way I could’ve divorced your dad and you would’ve been a better student and a better athlete in high school.”  I hear that in my head every night when I lay down.  On top of that, my mom has this obsession with being skinny so she makes comments about my weight, even though I have been told my body is perfectly normal by my doctor and others around me, this got to the point it hurt me so much that I’ve started wearing shirts that are 1-2 sizes bigger. She says awful comments to me over petty things, for example, there was a sweatshirt on my floor this morning because I took it off after I got hot in my sleep and she tells me “why can’t you keep your room clean? You can’t seem to do anything right”, or if I leave a plate in the sink she tells me how much of a slob I am. If something is not done to her specifications or the way she wants it, I don’t stop hearing about it until the end of the day, I get told that I’m useless, that I’ll never be able to live on my own, or that no girl will ever wanna marry me.  Today I reached a breaking point and left to go to my oldest sister’s house, my mother called me shortly after I arrived and continued to berate me over the phone, telling me I don’t do anything around the house and that I’m useless and that I’m just like my father.  Maybe I’m not making it sound as bad as it is, I’m a terrible storyteller, but these last 6 years with my mom have been nothing but a stain on my mental health, I can’t tell her how I feel because she tries to turn it around on me and make me feel bad.  I’ve always struggled with depression since I was a child and I’ve just kind of learned to live with it, however as of recent the thought has been swirling around to just take my own life, I firmly believe that I am not good enough for anyone or anything in this world, that if I am not worthy of a mother’s love, am I worthy of any love at all? It’s been 6 years of build up and I just don’t know what to do, I’ve tried counseling and medication, none of it helps, I’m not financially stable enough to move out and neither of my sisters nor my grandparents have the room to take me in.  I’m making this post as a last ditch effort to seek advice or even words of encouragement.  Thank you to all for taking the time out of your day to read this."

"(sorry that this is long, it's complicated) every time I share any part of my situation with my mother, no one understands what I'm going through, so I'm just gonna try to keep it short. lots of my siblings agree that my mother is abusive and so does my father. idk what started this whole issue but someday the ""peace"" that once existed within my family was absolutely destroyed, leaving me with a life where my mother tries to take over the family with legal power and abusing the power of being a guardian. P.S. She identifies as a Christian and has strictly believed many things in the bible  
  
since divorce processes take a while, (especially when you're trying to manage a \*family\* business your wife won't put the effort into assisting in the way you have been in the past decade) she has a lot of power against what belongs to who, (involving the kids). the reason why I know so much about all this is because my mom starts drama about almost anything in front of us whether it's about the kids or about the marriage.  
  
I'm lucky that no one in my family thinks what she's doing is fair, but she uses her legal right to control the family. and my 2 younger siblings struggle with deciding which parent to obey, especially when they are afraid of what the mother will do if they disobey her unreasonable demands I'm more defiant. thankfully she's out of the house most of the time because of everything that's going on. P.S. She plays the victim a lot by using facts yet morphing them into points that don't make sense for the disagreement. (if that makes sense) if she doesn't use facts, she'll just make her feelings the priority even when what should be the priority is logic/the point of the problem. I'm living in hell when my dad isn't there to make things right though, so I've tried my hardest to keep as much distance as I can when I need to.   
  
things got wild the night that I'm writing this bc my mom has re-attempted to take things related to the family and the love that once existed between my parents. me and my 2 siblings were there waiting for her to leave to the place she said she'd go to. the first thing she tried to take was a \*gift\* that she made for my father and her reasoning of why she should be able to take it was ""I made it myself and now I want it back."" my family agreed that that's not how it works but of course, my parents aren't officially divorced so she has legal ownership but it was morally wrong. in short, things got rough and my mother didn't seem to care about what we were feeling and she wouldn't stop physically trying to take a gift from my father's hands. when she cooperated. she made it seem like she was forced to instead of her agreeing to bc it was the right thing to do.  
  
it was a hurtful experience that I wish could be deeply understood without sharing too much info, but this experience combined with many others has left me with the aching wish of her not living, also because once the divorce process is done and things calm down she still lives life easy by relying on the money my father has earned by handling the business which is undeserved knowing what my father has had to go through these past months.

\*GRAPHIC\*  
I've imagined many things around the house in my hands as a tool to mash the side of my mother's head. I've never remembered my mother suffering through any kind of injury, so the thought of her suffering a lethal one after years of living an easy life was a comforting dream for me.

This is my first time sharing something like this at this degree and having it be so public, but I'm doing this bc I have no one to talk to, and I feel like no one understands, believes, or cares about what I'm going through (other than my father). sorry for making this long, I needed to add context to the complexity of her ridiculous logic. idk how views and impressions work on social media, but if you read all of this and actually care abt what I'm saying, tysm. please respond and tell me if you think what I'm saying is stupid or if it makes sense and ig share your thoughts on it, but yeah"

Not all things are horrible for me. I finally found my first real group of friends and I get the opportunity to go to college, aswell as have a roof over my head. But…I have NEVER had real help or support for most of my life.
At times my mom is the best mom ever, others she is pure pressuring a recovering Anorexic to go on a weight loss pill…which I did for a while.
I try very hard to make her happy and at ease, but when she catches me being “unproductive” and giggling in my room….it’s like I committed a crime.
There are times I do loose track of time when talking with my friends or making art, but everything with her and my dad is on eggshells all the time.
I love them, but their personalities shift so much.
I am working long hard hours to try and save for my own place, but I don’t even know how to do taxes or where to go for help."
"He can be such a controlling asshole who I can't say anything about while he uses me to feel better about himself. But he has his moments where I do feel for and understand him and times when he can make me actually feel my potential...but it's all overshadowed when he does the exact opposite, so I ask myself, why do I feel so guilty around him. Why is it I feel so much hatred yes love for him. I don't get it. When he dies I will be the last one crying at his grave while I carry his casket. Wtf kinda child am I."
"Is there some physiological reason my mom cries after screaming and hitting me and my siblings? My mother is physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive. She gets very mad very easily and tries to blame me and my siblings for everything that ever goes wrong or went wrong in her life. It’s not like the physical abuse is happening is very day, sometimes she lasts a whole month without  hitting us but this physical abuse started happening when I was 6 and and I am now 17 about to turn 18. My two sisters are 14 and 9 and even they can’t escape from our mother’s abuse. Even tho the physical abuse doesn’t happen everyday; there is not a day where my mother doesn’t scream at us. We just got out of a fight that included her yelling at us and attacking us (for no reason even tho she swears it’s our fault) and she started crying, and now she locked herself in her room and is probably crying. She has no reason to cry, shes the one who is abusive so why is she crying? Why does my mother cry after shes done hitting us? There was to be some physiological explanation for this."
"I just don't know how to cope with the comments that my mother gives me they are mostly negative. In relation to my weight and appearance. Please be kind.

I grew up with my mother as my main parent for a lot of my childhood. My real father was extremely abusive to her and we ran away. I was forced to see him every fortnight by the courts and the memories of the things he did still haunts me. As soon as I was legally an adult I cut him out of my life.

My mother herself will admit that she had a narcissist mother who would often be violent. Show little feelings of love or comfort towards my mother.
 She would often not feed my mother resulting in my mother being emasicated and extremely unwell. When my mother describes herself as ""painfully thin"" she often smiles about this and acts proud. Although not diagnosed with an ED she has always been heavily focused on calories and weight as long as I can remember.

For context she is very thin and is a size uk zero to 6. 
She still often refers to me as the chunky one in the family. Comments on my legs being thick and wobbly. She mentions often that she would like me to have children so that my belly can become big and saggy. 

like many teenagers that grew up in the late 90s and early 2000. I struggled with my body image, I would do anything to be thin.

I moved out early and still to this day have never received a phone call from her. I make all the effort to plan things. When we do talk or see one another she doesn't ask me anything about My life. Show any interest, When I try to she will start talking about herself or change the topic entirely. When we are in a group and I start talking, she talks over me.

and ended up spending the majority of my 20s in an unhappy and in a abusive relationship. 
 I never felt anything good about myself. I thought of myself as ""nothing"". My mental and physical health was the worst its ever been. I was experiencing many of the side effects of having an ED. I confided in my mother about what my ex partner was putting me through. She convinced me to stay in that relationship. Dispute later telling me she hated my ex partner. 
She is never able to offer me any worthwhile advice. Always blaming the problems in my life on my own actions. 

The police where called by a neighbour after a paticularly violent incident and I was set free 10 years of living in fear, pain and violence all gone away. The chance of a better life for myself although unaware of it at the time. I was still suffering the effects of believing that everything that happened to me was my own fault. I spent weeks of having crippling panic attacks. Eventually I learned to relive again.

I started secretly chatting and eventually dating to my long term crush. I moved into my own bedsit. I realised that they are a truly beautiful person, they helped repair some of the damage caused. We moved together fell in love and got engaged. They taught me a passion for life and how to enjoy everything including food. 

My body became healthy. I realised what having that feels like. I still struggle with body image and dismorphia. I have a good support system in place. I have been seen by a doctor who put me in a lower end but healthy BMI. Again just for context I am a uk size 8 and 6ft.
 
She was heavily critical of every decision that I made while planning my wedding and was extremely negative.

I took my mother wedding dress shopping and she was unable to say anything good. I choose the one according to my mother that didn't make me look ""big"" or ""fat"". 

She purchased a white wedding dress to wear to my wedding. When I mentioned I was hurt by this she went on a tangent saying that I only want her to look ""horrible"". She didn't wear the dress due to the support of my family after I explained the suitation they politely explained that the dress just doesnt suit her. 

We got married recently after a year of planning. It was everything that I dreamed of. I struggled with trying not to starve myself but managed to stay on track knowing that alterations are expensive and my dress fit well. 

The day before the wedding we went out for a big family meal. The only topic of conversation from her was about my husband looking nervous and regretting his decision to marry me. She keep whispering in my ear things along the lines of he won't turn up. 

The morning of my wedding I tried so hard to ignore the comments that she was making. She did her best to job distract the hair and MUA to prevent them from being able to focus on me. 
I asked her to help me put on my dress and this I regret deeply. She made a big issue of not being able to do it up. She spent 20 minutes commenting that I had put on loads of weight, despite me being aware that my weight is exactly the same as when I tried it on. When I mentioned this she tutted and asked ""you think so do you?"". 
Unfortunately after comment and negative criticism it did take its toll. Tried my best to put myself into the headspace of not thinking about my body and more on my beautiful husband. 

When I was fully dressed for my wedding and ready to go I never got any positive comments from my mother.
she swore and shouted at me in front of all my closest freinds and family just before I was about to walk down the isle. Seeing my husbands happiness at the end of it made it better.

When the photographer was around it was hard not to think about how ""fat"" I would look in the photos being taken, I felt unable to relax.

Dispute the negative impact of my mother I did have a beautiful wedding and an amazing time but I can't look at the photos of myself and feel attractive. I understand that a wedding is about marriage and me and my partner have a wonderful relationship where we have open communication.

I informed the wedding party about her behaviour and they where shocked. From now on I believe the best way to live my life is to focus on my marriage.

 I have brought up her behaviour in the past but as you can imagine it hasn't gone down well and it's always been ""my fault"". I spoke about her behaviour to my stepdad who simply put it down to my mother having verbal diarrhea. He explained that she is unaware of her words and the way they make others feel. I wouldn't describe my mother as happy in her appearance in fact it's quite the opposite. I always thought that narcissists belive that the are greatest best and most beautiful amazing people ever. However I don't know why else she would behave like this. I heard of grey rock syndrome. She also has strong emotions and the ability to feel things. She appears to lack something however. Could it be that she is emotionally immature ?. I would like to know so I can understand it better.

Dispute everything I love my mother it's difficult and complicated. I have come to accept that she cannot listen and doesn't understand the impact of her words

"My father abused and neglected me for 16years until i stopped visiting him due to COVID. My therapist advised me to write a letter and burn it, which i’m going to do. But i want to print out another copy and send it to him. I’ve gone no contact and this would be the last thing i ever said to him. I want it to have a jarring end. Like the typical email salutations eg. With love, but reversed so it’s Without Love, [my name]. 


any tips on this or the writing in general?"

"When I was 3, my dad broke the law and had to leave home. This left me with my mum and things were calm for a while. Eventually, he saw us more and more frequently then when I was 7 he moved in again to our new house. My mum and dad would argue more and more over the next few years until they would scream at each other for hours most days. Doors slammed, broken plates, road rage. My dad would never halm anyone physically, but he certainly would emotionally. Don’t get me wrong, my mum wasn’t perfect either, but at least when I looked through one of our bookshelves I found self help books with her notes in them. Also, whenever I had an issue I would go to my mum and she would help and support me. Me and my dad however were never that close and I wouldn’t even hug him. Then when I was 11, on Friday 13th March, 2020, the beginning of COVID, my mum passed away due to an aneurysm. The house felt eerily quiet and empty without her, and after that I would never be the same. The whole world was falling apart. I wasn’t going to school, and I’d just lost the one person I cared about most- my own mum. After that, me, my brother and my dad would hardly discuss the situation and instead just carry on as if nothing happened. Over the next few years, it would become more and more apparent to me that my dad had major anger issues, was emotionally absent and even controlling. He would call me names, criticise me, yell, not communicate whatsoever, and not try to change even when I made an effort to calmly tell him how he affected me. He even told me he was normal and every parent was like him. If I didn’t do what he said, he’d get really mad and simply give up trying. He gave up dealing with us a lot. He hates solving issues. My dad doesn’t even enjoy having normal conversations with me, or anyone for that matter, but especially me. When I try to talk to him for more than 5 minutes he will barely respond, tell me what I’m saying is a “stream of consciousness” (aka boring) or that I’m making him think too much. I understand that he’s not that social, but it feels like even short conversations bother him- from his own children. All of these issues with him and the rest of my family have caused me long term trauma and I feel like I can’t make any friends because no one likes me. If he can’t have constructive conversations with me, I seriously feel bad for my mum too. So in conclusion, I don’t know what to do because he has anger issues, cannot communicate and doesn’t want to change.
By the way, before anyone says it, yes I know he’s got to work and does a lot of the chores etc. But I’d rather be in a family where I have to do that myself and I feel actually cared for, than one which is the other way around."
You can come and vent to me if u want. 
"My mom said that my dad can see my activity, such as when I'm on my phone and what apps I'm on. 

This has caused me so much anxiety, as I have tiktok and Reddit which I'm not supposed to have. They havent said anything about that yet. I'm also a teenager doing teenager stuff, would prefer if my parents could not see everything on my phone. 

I don't have a great relationship with them and hate them knowing things about me in general. 

A quick google search and I found things like if you phone battery dies quickly or your phone lags or freezes a lot it could mean there's a tracking app installed. Both of these things seem to apply to my phone and I'm honestly really scared of them being able to see what I'm doing and when Im on my phone. I've looked through my settings and my ipod is under ""family"" there, which is under my moms email (I blocked it after that) but didn't find anything else. I'm not techy at all so I have no clue what to look for and where to look. I've googled this to no avail. 

I have tried telling her that I don't like being monitored and that its an invasion of privacy but she won't listen. Please help. 

Im sorry if this is the wrong place, my parents are emotionally and somewhat physically abusive and I dont know where else to go. "
"When I was growing up, and especially when I was little, I idolized my father.
I thought he was a great role model and his presence made me happy.
When I was a teen we would occasionally get into arguments, sometimes more severe and sometimes less but I still respected him and enjoyed his company overall. These arguments were always verbal, never physical except on one memorable occasion when he shoved me.
I wouldn’t say these arguments were out of the ordinary for what I think goes on in most families.
And my father, in many ways, was a very good dad when I was growing up. He was generous, usually pleasant and easy-going, he provided me and my brother with everything we ever needed, supported us in all our endeavors, and I related to him a lot as I felt many of our interests were similar. We share the same birthday and he has often expressed to me that I was the best birthday present he ever received.

Over my (27, almost 28M) young adult life my perception of my father has changed drastically as I have recently observed a number of verbally abusive behaviors from him towards me, my brother and my mom. While is possible that he has always acted this way to some degree and I just didn’t notice it as a child, I think he has gotten much worse over the years and my brother agrees. I don’t remember him acting this way when I was a kid. When he gets angry he does these things: He yells at all of us. He curses. He is passive aggressive, or sometimes very directly aggressive. He says things that are mean or derogatory. I remember him calling me “sensitive” in a derogatory way in an argument last year.

Things first got bad about 2 years ago when he had a fight with my mom about a bag of fruit that she threw out (not joking). He had picked the fruit from the yard himself a couple days prior but the fruit was starting to get old and soft. I wouldn’t have eaten it at that point. When he noticed it in the trash, he fished it out, tossed it at my mom and called her a b****. That was the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” things had been pretty pleasant and normal before then (not exactly as things were when I was a kid but similar) but after that I was deeply shaken. I should note that my mom does yell in arguments too and says some things back at my dad when they are arguing, but she is never abusive like that. 

Now since then there have been a number of arguments between me and my dad. We have talked these through, and each time he apologizes but it seems to me like he is always making excuses to go along with the apology, or at least that’s how I see it. He says he’s just telling me his own perspective and explaining what happened and why, and I usually take those as excuses but I wonder if I’m judging him too harshly and they’re not really excuses because isn’t it fair to give someone your perspective or explain what happened after an argument?

Anyway, things have felt a little teeter-totter since then. I’ll often have a visit or two where everything is fine, he’s the same generous loving father I remember: there are no arguments, he’s happy to see me, he hugs me, calls me “buddy,” we do fun activities together, he treats me to lunch etc. and I feel like the relationship is healing, but then the next visit we get into another argument and I lose a little more respect for him and I feel so awful.
So fast forward to today. My dad and my mom moved this weekend, and my brother and I went to help them with the move.

Well last night a couple hours after arriving to their new home we got into another argument. The house was very warm when we arrived and we switched on the A/C immediately but after several hours as it neared bedtime it was still pretty warm in the bedroom and I was worried that I wasn’t going to be able to sleep well so I expressed my concern repeatedly. That was probably annoying, I was just anxious because I really needed a good night’s sleep. Then I walked around the house trying to make sure the vents were all open, etc. and found that my dad had left a window open while they were gone despite it being 100 degrees outside and they hadn’t closed them since arriving. I came out and said maybe it would be cooler if my dad hadn’t left the window open. Honest to goodness I wasn’t trying to incite anything, I was just annoyed.
And that is when it happened. 
My dad said “f*** you” to me, went into his own room and shut the door. I didn’t see him for the rest of the night. I was deeply hurt.
I take responsibility for my own comment, I probably shouldn’t have/didn’t need to say that but his reaction was so unwarranted.

For context, I am a pretty calm and relaxed person the vast majority of the time. This is not just my own perception - everyone I know says this about me. They consider my calmness one of my defining traits. Perhaps because of my innate nature or perhaps as a reaction to the very strong personalities in my family, I have made a conscious effort in my life to process my emotions in healthy, productive ways, including my anger. I never yell at my friends and especially never at my partner. The cycle ends with me. Unfortunately however, I find that I do yell at my parents and my brother. I have found it difficult to change with them, as they are so explosive. Aside from those three, I find it is easy to maintain my composure and refrain from yelling.

So this morning he gave me a somewhat weak apology, the same deal as many other arguments. He said he was sorry and then started trying to explain what happened. I said he was making excuses.
He started yelling at me and I yelled back. I yelled at him that cursing his own son out like that was abusive and that I would not accept it. He claimed that I was provoking him and doing things to push his buttons. I said that was not my intention and all I wanted to hear from him was that what he said was wrong and that he wouldn’t do it again. After all, I probably shouldn’t have said what I said but what he said was much worse. He said I had to acknowledge that I was pushing his buttons and inciting things and that his feelings were valid too. I certainly would have acknowledged that in different circumstances but because of the context I saw that as more excuses and avoiding a real apology so I told him I had nothing left to say. Now we haven’t spoken more than a few words in a few hours.

So Reddit, I understand that I need to process this on my own terms and the way I see fit. Maybe I need some therapy.
But just as a gut reaction what do you all you folks out there think of this?
What would be an appropriate course of action? Is this able to be resolved? Should I apologize to him for “pushing his buttons?” What do you think is the best path forward? 
I don’t want to react too extremely, I do still love my dad and I don’t want him out of my life. That being said, every time we have one of these arguments it is slowly but surely tarnishing a family relationship that I’ve known and cherished my whole life.
Thanks in advance for your responses.

"Hi so recently im a bit confused regarding an incident, so to give context it’s regarding my mother who i believe isn’t completely ‘emotionally normal’, i would not go into the details as i have already in another post so it doesn’t matter, the thing is that
A few months back, i remembered an incident of when i was around 5 or 6 i guess, my ‘mother’, getting an ‘episode’ or something as usual and she went to the kitchen threatening to kill herself, idr exactly but i think I went inside ig and then she held my hand and tried doing it to  me as well, I somehow managed to get out of the situation, but I remember she said something while holding my hand like ‘yeah you come along with me as well’ idr exactly tho.
Also this wasn’t the first time she tried harming herself the second or third time ig, theonly difference was she tried doing it to me as well this time.
But i dont get it, why after all these years have a randomly out of nowhere recalled such stuff, and it’s kinda bothering me now, not alot just a bit. Also after all these years i feel like i am making all this up and it is in my mind, like a bad dream or something, idk what it is actually,
Also as a kid i believed all this stuff was normal until I realised maybe not..
 anyways have a good day! Thank you

"I am 16 years old and it was never easy growing up with my stepfather. He abused me and beat me regularly when I was growing up. But 3 years ago he sexually assaulted me and tried to rape me several times. My mom, who worships him, didn't leave him. Over those 3 years I have built up a disgusting amount of anger. For the past 2 weeks I have been thinking of killing him. Every time he tries to hit my brother, me or my mom, I stop him by pulling out a knife. I think it's because he beat me up so bad 2 weeks ago that I will never let him get to me again. He's dirt. And if he ever comes near me again, I swear to God. Also my mother disgusts me because she keeps kissing and sleeping with him. Sleeps in the same bed. Even though I will always protect her, I will never love her again. How do I control this anger and disgust?"
"My nightmare is of one of my siblings dying and me being unable to protect them like I am supposed to as an older sibling. I have this nightmare every now and then. I usually never have bad dreams, but when I do this is the one I get."
"So yeah. My mom always has been emotionally abusive, forced me into religions and insulted me a lot. My dad? He's greedy as heck. He can't even buy a few pieces of clothing to an important event coming up without looking for cheaper options. Unlike my mom, dad actually helped me a lot. He buys me books, only books without hesitation and feels grateful for me for not asking for a lot unlike my brothers. (That was 3 ford's in one sentence, it doesn't feel grammatically correct at all)
My mom always insults me whenever she has the chance. My hair is a bit dirty because I've been feeling depressed and tired for a few days? ""How are you my daughter? You sure your brain is attached? Your hair is disgusting. I'm being honest, __.""
My outfit doesn't fit her fashion sense? ""What kind of a girl are you? Change, I gave birth to you and you belong to me."" And shit like those

Sure, she cared about education - religious education. I went to a strictly Islamic school almost my entire life. I'm an atheist, trans and bi guy so yeah I was surrounded by girls the entire time which was awkward. The general education was way better than public schools. She also made sure I got anything I needed which I'm extremely grateful of. She treats me like a doll, sure but I'm grateful for her giving me a great education and 3 life time friends. 
My dad and she got in an argument today. She's leaving back to Uzbekistan. My little brother, who's autistic, is going in a depressive episode. He basically shut down, laid down and didn't respond to anything but just draw something on his phone. I'm scared for him, I already texted my older brother he said he'll help as soon as he gets back. Our mom? She doesn't give a fuck. She says we're ""blood-traitors"" that doesn't feel grateful for her. 
I'm feeling numb and scared for my brother. What do I even do?

"So I have an emotional abusive dad I don’t really wanna go into the details but basically my parents had a horrible divorce and I was caught in the middle and somehow this awful man was able to get full custody of me. (Probably through lies and manipulation) he always would tell me things as a kid as fact, like: your mother is an abusive monster, you don’t really have a mother, we are two peas in a pod, I’m always there for you, I’m your support system. All of these things I realized was a way to isolate me and control me. This dawned on me after my dad having a mood swing (he always has mood swings where he makes and excuse that it was ok for him to treat me that way because xyz.. usually in relation to oh.. well I was in pain, or oh I wasent feeling well, or oh I was tired.) he called me “bad dog” for staying up late keep in mind I’m 19 and completely able to do as I please as a legal adult and while yes I shouldn’t be staying up late my sleep schedule is not the best because my mental health has been all over the place and I’m struggling with untreated mental health conditions I’m working to treat hopefully. And if you’re asking why is a 19 year old still living with their parent? I’m possibly disabled (I say possibly because I haven’t been able to get diagnosed due to no access to medical care until recently) and unemployed due to zero job experience and having physical limitations, I’m hoping to get into collage soon but I just needed a break year for my mental health. So back to what I was saying hearing my dad call me “bag dog” brought me back to all the times when I was a kid where when I did anything he didn’t like or if I misbehaved or questioned him he would call me “bad dog” and how dehumanizing it felt I of course didn’t know the words for it as a 7 year old but it’s just shocking to me that he would do stuff like that and then turn around and be like “I’m your only solid support, everyone else is supporting you to but I’m your number one supporter” and then belittle every other support I had that didn’t fit his rhetoric. I just can’t wrap my head around why he would do that I mean I get that he wanted to control me but it just creeps me out and made me realize how controlling and possessive my dad really is over me and I’m just in a bit of shock and idk what to do I really want to get my own apartment and get the fuck away from him but I’m unable to do so at the moment and it’s terrifying I’m scared of him and now anytime he makes a movement I’m tense and I prepare myself to deal with his bullshit and I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t take it anymore. I just idk what to do or what to think. I’d really appreciate some outside perspectives on this. (Also just so it’s known this is the very tip of the iceberg with how awful and creepy my dad can be this post could be endless if I tryed to cover it all haha i just wanted that to be known cuz idk how this post may seem from the outside but it’s been a long time coming in my opinion.)"
"So my parents were extremely emotionally abusive and ruined my life as a young adult by lying to the entire community about me.... Now I'm in my 30's and have gotten injured so much that I am basically completely disabled... And I have no where else to turn until I can get disability... If that even happens... So I may be forced to move back in with them. 

Can anyone offer me any motivation or suggestions or anything I am feeling very lost and scared about this step in my life.... "
"Even though I'm a woman I wish I could've had a real dad.

My lack of a real 'father' figure genuinely bothers me. 

I (28 TF) am a woman, not a man. I've been transitioned for a couple years now (MtF). And NO, having a weak father is not what made me trans. I've had female inclination in my brain structure since I was like in kindergarten.  And no, no one 'touched me' either. Despite the fact that I am a woman, I still spent 26 years, being socialized, trying my best to be, and being perceived, as a man. I used to look up to my father, for his work ethic, his honesty, and his devotion to my mother. I would harrowingly and brutally, find out he was actually a liar, an adulterer, and upon reflection, I realized he never really was there for me,  or my brothers. I distinctly remember having to teach myself how to tie a tie before my first job interview, using a YouTube instructional video. Everything I learned about fixing cars (not that that is an inherently male trait), I learned either from my older brother (33 M), or from work experience as I used to sell and work with auto parts professionally. 


Now the car thing is understandable as I never expressed ANY interest in working on mechanics or in engineering.  I was always more into philosophy,  history, art, fashion, political science, nerd stuff like comics and books and cartoons. Things of that nature. Which are not gender specific things btw. I learned how to fight (which toxic as some may think, is a genuine important part of being a man unfortunately) , from again having brothers, having friends who studied MMA, and from dangerous street fights (this last one sounds cool, but was not, I had to go through alot of therapy to undo some damage done to me from having these too young). He taught me how to throw a ball i guess, and I even was on a baseball team for a season as a kid, and we were second in our division (otherwise known as the team that lost to the team that would go on to state). 


Sports i always had a passive appreciation of, and I did enjoy the experience but tbh sports were also not my Forte.  Now I have a cellular disease known as 'mitochondrial' disease. So I also spent alot of time in and out of a wheelchair as a kid. I would get substantially healthier as a teen. But I never had any genuine instruction from my father on ""manhood"", hell my brother gave me 'the talk' before my dad did. One thing I always respected about him though was his morals he would espouse to believe in. The fact he worked alot. And that when I had my first girlfriend he didnt objectify the concept, he said "" Just be sure to treat her like a proper lady.""  And now, I'm gay. As a woman I mean. Transbian is what the term is. Which was one of the reasons I struggled to realize I was trans. But again when push came to shove, I realized, post transition.


 He wasn't really honest. I knew it would've been a stretch to get him on board with my transition as he's a DEVOUT RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE,  however, believe it or not I'm still a Christian myself, obviously more progressive in doctrinal understanding, but I would end up going to seminary and getting several study certificates, 


 I am also now a legally ordained non denominational Christian minister, and currently study Christian topics at Yale online.  Gearing up for a big ""showdown of theology"" when I first came out, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find he said "" Well I Accept you, umm, are you a Christian still? Not to be rude, are you a 'full bore woman' now? (Asking if I 'had the surgery' or not).""  And I answered accurately "" Not that its anyone's business, but I have not had any operations, no. (at the time was true), and i still believe in Jesus, yes. "" Some remarks here and there would be not fully 'PC', but I would tolerate in patience,  he invited me to study the Bible with him, a chance I jumped on as, im sure its obvious from my disclosure that I'm a minister, but theology and biblical study are a shared special interest of him and I, so I thought he was being genuine, and naively let my gaurd down. Now he did this thing whilst we studied where he would ""accidently "" misgender me and or deadname me.



 I would always just very politely, correct him. He would say sorry and then seemingly get better and try. However there was a pattern, he would do the exact same process of slipping in my deadname and old gender, and I am not stupid, so I asked him one day. "" Dad, you don't think this Bible study is going to magically make me detransition right?"" And halfway still believing, optimistically, that I WAS maybe imagining the pattern, I was promptly disapointed and honestly,  heartshattered. When he said

 "" Well, I can't confirm or deny that, I want what God wants, son."" I held my wits and emotions together,  and corrected him again. "" It would be daughter not son, and I honestly don't think we should continue with the study. I thought you wanted to reconnect. And admit it or not, you had other motives."" He apologized and simply


 said "" Well the offer still stands. "" Barely acknowledging what he was trying to do. I Had gone on with an optimistic hope, but a now validated reserved approach to my dad. For further context if you are wondering, my mother passed, it was the spark that made me fully realize I needed to transition. And Mind you, myself and my partner at the time paid for her funeral. I waited until she was cremated and memorialized before coming out to the rest of my family, I even gave them all one last Christmas with the old me. And As fate would have it, the year I came out, was the year the Cincinnati Bengals would go to the super bowl. The Bengals are my dad's favorite football team.


 I went with him, when neither of my brothers would, to his little sports bar he began hanging out in, and I gave him that shared experience,  to watch his team, with his ""son"", I didnt say anything, but in my head that was my old self's personal goodbye to him as a father/son dynamic. Despite these things, my father didn't care, a following Sunday, the ""church"" he attends (will elaborate on why its in quotations later), after the Bible study attack had failed to ""convert"" me back to ""normal"", I tuned in to his ""church"" livestreams, because A, I wanted to know what they were preaching, and B, I still wanted some connection to him. To my horror, the ""Pastor"", Dropped my deadname and demanded the congregation ""pray for his salvation"", in reference to me. That was at the time, the final straw, and I texted my father a long, respectful, but stern letter, explaining I was going to be no contact with him for awhile.


 Now as fate would have it, my partner at the time would turn abusive, at one point even brutally beating me (I have documentation of this), i was homeless, and the only place left would end up being his property. I had explained to him that the ONLY THING I would need of him, would be to respect my pronouns and name. Which btw is my birth name, because I was a man they all pronounced it different but my mother always intended for it to be pronounced how I pronounce it now anyways I only legally changed my dead middle name to Ann, after my grandma as my dead middle name was after my grandpa . 



So all in all not even hard to do. Long story short, he would kick me out, and I was on my own completely. In this time frame I had become ordained, and received seminary training. In a scathing falling out argument we had, I had given him several resources about LGBTQ stuff,  in order to help him understand. I was INCREDIBLY patient. He one day retorted ALL OF MY EFFORTS  with a simple "" Well none of those studies are Christian specific, so I don't care about them. "" So I as a Christian took up the challenge,  I gave him articles written by affirming modern day reformation leaders, Books written by affirming Protestant Reverends, YouTube channels ran by affirming Pastors, and even my own tidbits I had discovered about translation,  after receiving my Art of biblical words Certification.  I would find out later, he never even opened any of them. He was set in his way. For no reason. I remember one line "" Even if they don't specifically condemn it, they do in fact, not explicitly affirm it either. So I'll NEVER accept it."" He said a plethora of really disgusting things to me as well in regards to my transness, and he seemed angry that I thought I could somehow call myself a Christian. During my time being homeless again. I would, whilst doing independent denominational research,  browse my dad's ""church"" which I was partially raised in, into my denominational searching methods. To discover they are a prosperity gospel heretical, finacial scamming, controlling, cult, which is HEAVILLY documented, and even was attached to a deadly trucking attack in Australia, and was covered by both ABC news and 60 minutes. I am eternally grateful that I was not baptized in them, I later would become consecrated to the lord, via being publicly baptized in an ELCA Lutheran Church, and I have undergone extensive therapy to undo the damage the cult rhetoric did to my psyche. 





So anyways I would find out from my younger brother (M 23), that my father had cheated on our mother while she was alive, paired with him lying about ever honestly interacting with my research I FREELY labored for to share with him, my entire image of him is shattered. And now those other things I mentioned, are glaringly more obvious. He never, taught me how to be a man. I am not a man, and again him being a poor excuse of a father, is not at all why I transitioned,  I literally am medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria, but I still am deeply hurt and saddened, by the fact my ""dad"" is a truly horrid parent.




Other things that would come to light would be the beatings I used to remember as well deserved discipline,  were actually all child abuse, and often, were being done because we broke rules that were arbitrarily given based on his belief that, similar to the cult, otherwise completely harmless items, content, or media, were somehow witchcraft or demonically possessed. Certain things he thought as such about, were ""The dark knight"" batman movie, as the cult had a theory that Heath Ledger was possessed by a ""joker spirit"" demon, and thats why he sadly overdosed, any non critical mention of any apocryphal texts (which again i freely acknowledge as non Canon as a protestant myself), the TV show modern family, as it encouraged, ""queers"", as lgbtq folks are another topic the cult is insanely hateful of,  I remember that until highschool I wasn't even allowed to call Halloween, Halloween, my older brother had to beg to allow myself and my younger brother a chance to celebrate it, and he did as such, by having to write a report on the true orgins of Halloween. 


To my horror, after my dear mother passed, he has gone unchallenged, as she used to often push back on him, he now doesn't even watch TV news. He only consumes cult approved content, Christian youtubers (a subject i actually also consume), sports,  and Bible readings.  He rejects anything that counteracts the cult specific interpretations of scripture, he told my little brother he was ""never going to see his mother again"" and that ""Jesus told him he was evil"". The damage of being raised by such a man is still present. "
"When I was 14 and younger, my dad would frequently beat me up/kick me out of the house/impose his religious muslim rules on me/curse me out. Now I’m 16 and since we don’t interact much he only keeps it to the verbal abuse. Always telling me how i’m not worth anything and I’m a “good for nothing” daughter. It really hurts me when I see other girls my age have such kind and caring fathers. I feel like he has shattered my confidence so deeply that I’m a shell of a person. I always wondered how many others girls my age had fathers who would punch them or backhand them for minor inconveniences at the age of 9. Sometimes i find myself wishing that he dies so i can finally be at peace and not afraid of him. 

I’m going to be a junior this year and I wanted to apply to really good colleges but because of him I fell into such severe depression that now I’m a pretty average student with no extracurriculars. I can’t get a part time job right now because of my visa status so i have to rely on him for money. i really want my life to get better. does anyone know what to do? "
I decided over 1 year ago to go no contact with my father as he was abusive during my childhood. I knew doing this there was a very likely chance he wouldn't try to repare the relationship and just go along with the no contact. Since this he has gotten engaged and I was a little surprised that he didn't try contact me to inform me. Today my grandma ran into him and was talking to him and he didn't ask her how me or my sister were. I feel unwanted even though I was the one to initiate the no contact 
"So I'm 15f am the youngest girl of 6 kids 4 girls 2 boys, I live with my youngest brother 21m and my dad 50m, for context most of my siblings have different moms beside me and my brother 21m, our mom has lived in New York for the past 12 and a half years, we've been raised by our dad in texas, my brother has a job but has only had it for a year and before that he did nothing, he finish high school at 19 and took a year off after, I'm going into my sophomore year in a couple weeks, my dad never gets mad or upset at my brother, I think it's mostly because they look a lot alike and he's the only boy my dad raised, so it's kinda like his only son, I look like my mother and my father hates her, I get yelled at or stuff I didn't even do, I've have been hit a couple times but rarely, and it's mostly just stuff like him saying he's gonna send me to my mom and that I act just like her, he knows I don't like being compared to my mother yet he does it anyways, I know it's not a lot but hes been doing it for years and I just want to know is it abuse"
"I know reddit is the worst place to post about this but I don't know what else to do anymore and I am actively in the situation so I don't have anyone I can turn to.

I am 18, and have left my abusive father's home to live with my mother and grandmother who I thought were better. I was wrong. 

my 7 year old sister has seen and been through hell, and as a result her behavior is very, VERY, bad. and it has only actually happened once (twice in the one sitting) but my grandmother hit her with a plastic spoon

my sister hits, screams, insults, runs away with objects, breaks things, anything you can think of due to the things my MOTHER has put her through. she only hits me though as i am the gentle parent in this situation so to speak and I am also the strictest. i stick to my rules and i never EVER give in to her. ive had people tell me this isn't my responsibility or burden to carry, it's my mother's but I still don't know what to do. 

i don't know what to do, I've explained this isn't okay, I've explained this damages her, I've explained and explained and explained and I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should call CPS because they've already been called twice and they've given her back to my mother who is enabling this behavior both times. the police in our neighborhood won't help, I've tried when enduring my own abuse. 

my sister goes in for therapy on friday which is something I had to pull teeth to put in motion, my mother wants opinions from professionals and I don't know if I should wait for that to happen, call cps, call the police, I don't know what to do anymore I need help please"
"Hello, who ever sees this message will be the first person besides my husband,I’ve ever told about this hell that I’ve endured the last 22 years I’ve been on this earth. I (22 F) came from a pretty shitty household. My father who is very abusive and an addict and my mother who has become abusive and a recovering drug addict, but newly alcoholic. I was SA’ed by my father from my earliest memory in diapers to about 4 years old. I had gotten “too old” for my father’s perverted fantasy. My earliest memory being physically abused, I was about three years old. I was thrown down a flight of stairs and whipped continuously with a wet towel until my mother stepped in and then she was the target of his aggression. Since my mother was so afraid of him, she wouldn’t call the police. For years I had been throw against walls, choke slammed, pinched, verbally abused, sexually exploited, the list could go on and on. I met my husband (24 M) the summer before middle school from my cousin. I would go over to his house almost everyday just to get away from the abuse. I had his mother take me to get on birth control because even though I didn’t know much, I knew I couldn’t bring a child into this living hell. Fast forward to the day after I turned 16. I had came home from my husband’s house. My father already aggravated started on me. Telling me that I was selfish for letting my husband have me all to himself. Calling me a whore, fat, worthless you name it. That day I decided I wasn’t afraid of him anymore. I defended myself and he couldn’t stand that I didn’t fear him anymore. He grabbed me by my hair and throat and slammed me on to the wooden floor. I grabbed whatever I could and bashed him in the face. After he got off me, I started packing all my belongings. We had came to the agreement that if I never told about him SA me or the abuse that he would let me leave. I felt terrible for leaving my mother but I knew that if I didn’t leave that I would die. I moved in with my husband and his family, graduated high school, got a great job, bought a car, and then eventually we bought a house together. Now we are married, we have a son and I have been no contact with my father for 12 months now. If you are in a situation like this now, this is proof that you will make it. THINGS GET BETTER. Lmk if y’all want a part two about my mother.

"After years of trying to communicate the harm they’ve done to me, I’ve finally given up. I don’t feel any sense of remorse or regret or shame. In fact, I feel nothing. I just blocked them and moved about my day. I don’t think they fully understand that I don’t consider them, or think about them; I’ve removed them so much from my life that severing the only line of communication we had was all that I had to do.

I sometimes wish it would have been different; I would have liked to have parents who loved and respected me, but they can’t change. They’re so hellbent on denying the abuse; so determined to pretend none of it happened. They’re so pathetic, really. Then again, seeing what raised them, I shouldn’t be too surprised. The apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Their loss, though. I have a partner who loves me and friends who love me. I’m happy where I’m at. I don’t need anything from them.  

C’est la vie."
"f15, I don’t want to live with my family anymore and I don’t know whether I should leave or not. For as long as I can remember there has been yelling all the time and I don’t feel safe living with them but I also feel guilty if I leave. An organisation offered to give me a place to live, Should I wait 3 more years to legally move out without causing drama in my family or move out now?"
"My dad genuinely is not capable of having feelings, empathy, or sympathy for starters. But our whole relationship (I’m 25F and he’s 58M) is so surface level and transactional. For example I’m in AZ where it’s 115 degrees outside and my power went out… my dad said i could come over until it came back on ONLY if i brought him a cheeseburger?? Then i said No and he said “then don’t come”. 
Or he will only do something for me if I do something for him. He will only pick me up milk from the store if i clean his house or truck. Nothing is ever just a nice gesture. 
For me, He’s my dad so I would clean his house if he needed me too anyways for nothing in return. But it’s always a catch with him.
If he ever offers to do something later on in life he will hold it against you like “well I did this for you so now you need to do this for me or pay me back somehow.” 
Just so irritating how people can’t do things out of goodness in their hearts anymore. "

So I’m trying to figure out if what I experienced within my family was sexual abuse. For context my mom was a stripper all throughout my childhood. Her father, ran and managed most of the clubs she worked at ( not all, but enough). When I was a child and teen I remember my mom being naked most of the time. She was under a blanket but it was apparent she was nude. Once when she was drunk and had hurt herself she needed my help to get into bed, she had taken all her clothes off and then sneered at me and told me not to look at her and called me a pervert- I wasn’t looked by the way, I was just trying to help my drunk naked mom into bed at 13. There were times when she would make comments about my developing breasts and poke them and laugh and giggle despite me expressing I didn’t like it. It felt like she was trying to embarrass me. There was also at least one occasion where she barged into the bathroom and took a photo of me naked as I was getting into the shower and again laughed and joked about it ( and had that photo developed.) Her and my grandfather also would make inappropriate sexual jokes and comments (not together or at each other just in general). Also, less conspicuous I guess but she would lick and suck on my step dad’s tongue in front of us and then laugh when I was grossed out by it. 

My grandfather would make the worst and most sexual comments and talk about bending women over and making grunting sexual noises. He would also talk about how frequently him and his wife had sex and things like that. All of this was just so normal that even now in my 30’s I’m just starting to question these things. And figure out how to define them. I truly don’t think my mom at least got any sexual gratification from these things it was more to humiliate and embarrass me and she was incredibly immature in a lot of ways so it feels very gray to me.

"So i have been sick all day today with light fever and a cold and a shit load of body ache. My mom was out at the parlor all day and asked me to go get my little sister from school even tho  im sick btw she didnt know cause she didnt bother to ask duh, i  ask her to make me a drink to make me feel better ans so she does. When she comes in my room, she screams at me and threatens to throw the boiling hot  drink on me and guess why? cause my lights are not turned on properly therefore im not studying ( my head hurts and so i kept the lights down low and have been doing maths for the last 3 hours even tho i  dont feel good) we argue for a bit and once she leaves i start crying. Now i have a major headache and my eye hurts more and i  didnt want to bother my friend so im writing this ( may i remind you i turned 15 2 weeks ago)"
"My father (single parent) has raised me all his life, my mother was never in the picture. All my life he has been controlling me and telling me how to live my life, not to mention the physical and mental abuse he has inflicted on me when i was a child. My father is an alcoholic for years now and his entire brain is wired differently, he‘s not capable to see someone else’s point or understanding. I am 21 (F) and I still live with him. There is some type of Co-Dependency between us. He always told me how he wants me to dress, how he wants me to wear my hair, what kind of man I should marry in the future and how I should name my children. I am aware that he is probably a narcissist or some of the sort, because if I don‘t end up marrying the kind of man he chooses for me, he will be „heartbroken“. He has a victim complex and doesn‘t respect my feelings or my thoughts. I have tried to communicate alot of it with him. I have tried to explain to him that I am my own person and that me cutting my hair doesn‘t make me a bad daughter just because he doesn‘t like it, but he never listens. I‘ve repeated myself multiple times but there‘s no use to it. I don‘t have any siblings, so moving out is not an option for me currently. My father is very depressed and doesn‘t see a reason to keep on living, except me. I don‘t know what to do. He is the reason why I go to therapy and have so many mental issues but he is also my best friend. 

I wish I could just hate him but all I feel for him is pity and alot of guilt if I think of leaving him all alone on his own.

"Just a rant.

A few days ago I was sent to my grandmothers apartment in New York to watch her after eye surgery since my uncle usually gets off work at late times and is unable to care for her to his full capacity. 

I was hesitant at first but after a few days of staying here I felt so free. My parents, two ivy league students have been very pushy about this college application process even though I know I don't have the grades or skills to get into any of their dream schools for me. 

I don’t know where im going with this but this whole trip just gave me so many opportunities to do teenage things. I was finally able to call my boyfriend and friends, not hear my parents screaming and cursing at one another, and I didn’t have to deal with my dad yelling and threatening me. It felt so nice. 

Maybe im not a victim of anything, maybe im just over exaggerating and begging for attention but when my mom came over to take me back home my body went hot and i completely lost it. I literally feel like im going to pass out. I can’t go back. I don’t want to. But I realized that if I don’t my dad would lose it and he’d argue with my mom or call me just to berate me even more. 

I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I could tell my boyfriend. I wish highschool was over so I’d never have to see my dad again. I wish I didn’t have to accept the reality of this situation and just say “im not going!” and run away from all my problems. Too bad I can’t lol."
"I'm crying in my room right now after being yelled at through the wall. I have IBS and been having a flare up for 2 days now. I had diarrhea all day long and multiple stomach cramps, making it more comfortable for me to lay in bed and distract myself from being on my laptop as well as doing school work online. He has IBS himself so it is not like he's uneducated. 

It began when I was sitting in my room, listening to Johnnie Guilbert songs when I heard him call out saying I need to walk the dogs, He knew I was having a rough day w/ pain and diarrhea however he still asked. When I said I couldn't be because I had  diarrhea and pain meaning I couldn't risk having a bad accident. I could hear him yelling 'For fuck sake, Fine them. Me and ur Mom will walk them' (Roughly, I can remember). Now-I know I sound like a brat but hear me out, He was yelling it aggressively not like a 'OK, We'll walk them' .

He's been guilt tripping me and my mom for years, I feel insanely uncomfortable around him since when he would get mad and begin screaming which I would end up sobbing, If I began sobbing he would get even more mad. M friends say I have massive father issues but I think I'm being dramatic since abuse is physical. 

As If my mental health was crap to begin with. "
"Hi. I've been dealing with guilt and grief because I leave in 2 months. I love my family, but they are so abusive. They've been acting super nice and sweet because I think they know I'm about to be 18, but as soon as they get reassurance they have me locked down I know they'll be back to it just like they do my brother. I've been planning leaving since May 2023. I have an entire plan but I'm getting the anxiety and guilt here and there. I want to be free so badly. But I still have guilt and grief about it because I don't want to hurt them despite all they've don't to me. Help?"
"I read a quote that said “having an abusive parent that breaks their back to provide for you is SO tumultuous like how can i hate you when you built a life for me from dust but also how can i not when you've hurt me so badly” and it stuck with me. 

You are ungrateful if you leave but cry everyday because home doesn’t feel like home at all. You are unhappy then, you are unhappy now. Idk how to deal with this because people tell you that you are exaggerating because all your needs are getting fulfilled but but what about the constant comparison with my older sister, what about the backhanded comments, what about the insult in front of others, and what about no freedom and making every important decision for me. The idea of death feels more alive."
"For context my cousin is 21 and I’m 24, for as long as I remember when visiting my cousin and family she and her sisters were always yelled and always hit by their mother. The oldest of the three is getting the brunt of it, whether she did anything or not her mother yells and hits her. It’s been getting worse as she gets older with her mother breaking her nose, stepping on her head, and causing her face to get scratched. It got so bad 1 time that her younger sister got involved in a very bad fight that her heart stopped and the ambulance had to be called to get her heart moving again.

Recently my cousin (21) broke up with her idiot cheating boyfriend and her mom is trying to get the two of them back together. I don’t know why her mom is so persistent with her to be with this guy. In her eyes because he “ doesn’t do” drugs, smokes, gambles, comes from “rich” family, etc that she should give this cheating scumbag a second chance. It’s gotten to the point that she is constantly calling her, following her, and not allowing her to hang out with her friends, go to her friends wedding and so on and so forth. Complete isolation bar family.

My uncle is basically never home due to his job where he is constantly driving and when he gets home he is so exhausted that all he has the energy for is to eat and sleep. My grandmother is the one who fiercely protects her like a shield otherwise her mother would do worse things.

I suggested calling the police, however she lives in a country where reputation is extremely important and calling the police would damage the family’s reputation severely. I suggested getting a job but she said that her mother wouldn’t allow it. I also suggested for her to stay with our grandparents as they have more than enough space, but she said that her mother wouldn’t allow it and would hit her and force her to come back home.

She is so done and she wants to get as far away as possible from her mother. She wants to cut contact completely. She has no idea how she can escape from her clutches. One of her ideas is to get married, and/or leave the country completely. 

At this point she doesn’t know what to do and I have no idea how to help her 🥺. Please help🙏"
"she's never on my side. she tells me im mean to her, manipulative, spoiled, criticizes my appearance, etc... she also pulls my hair and hits me sometimes. she defends my 25 y/o brother who hits me frequently and gets mad when i dont like her abusive boyfriend. she drinks a lot and plays music so loud my room shakes."
"I (f20) am no contact with my dad. It's been about a year since we spoke. The only contact we have is me and him telling our mom to tell each other that we're watching the horror flick we watch every year on father's day. 

He never treated me with love and respect. That's all I need to say. 

I keep finding myself looking for a ""new dad"". He was always there. I don't want to feel like this. All of my friends' dad's seem like applicants rather than acquaintances. How do I stop feeling that I need my dad?"

"For context im 19f, commuting to college and live with my dad to save money. My parents lived together since I was 6 and I used to legally have to be at a parent’s house for certain days of the week until I turned 18. After turning 18 I stopped going to my mom’s house because it felt a bit uncomfortable there. My mom recently got a boyfriend which would be okay to me except his presence bothers me. My mother was very verbally, physically, and arguably emotionally abusive towards me growing up. By growing up I mean since i could remember, up until now but it has gotten much less severe. My dad was not emotionally there for me and he did occasionally yell at me and physically hit me when I was very young but it was only traumatizing to me one time but he was much less emotional as my mom.

As ive grown up, I realized that maybe my parents want to change to be better. Or theyre not as stressed out enough to let their anger foster that way. My dad has been really chill for a while now and im starting to forgive him as hes shown he truly cares and wants what’s best for me, we have never talked about it but i can sense it. My mom is a different case. My mom has continued the yelling and the randomly getting angry/mean and it genuinely scares me. Its the only thing that can make me lose control of my emotions and just cry. Its not full on screaming anymore, but its definitely sudden anger and belittling. She was not angry at all times during my childhood, I loved when she was happy bc she made me feel loved, she did not hug me or show me  affection but she spent time with me and i enjoyed it. To me, that was love. I know there’s probably a woman very broken in her but I cant let go of the constant fear I feel around her. Its physical fear, and its scary. I fear that the “good” mother will go away and I get “bad” mother that makes me feel so awful. I know I am not the best person either, when you live with anger issues you get anger issues, couple that with religious trauma and discovering my sexuality, i could find myself repeating her anger and arguing with those very close to me. (I am working on myself and getting better and I wasn't nearly as far gone as her). I want to forgive her but this is my predicament. She’s got a new boyfriend that moved in and shes visibly a happier person, at least, to the eye. But she’s kind of cut off my grandparents, who helped her so much as a single parent after having the stability of having a partner. To me, it feels a little icky… but its not my problem, so I feel wrong to foster hatred towards her; maybe they hurt her like she hurt me and that’s why once she was secure, she was done with them.I only know this information because my grandparents call me constantly, asking me about what’s wrong with her and urging me to ask her myself because she has ghosted them. This leads me to believe she truly did not grow and she can turn into “bad” mom real quick, especially if the boyfriend is gone. They have been together for years now, but I am someone that low key does not believe in love (ik working on that) so my fear is consuming me because im afraid they will eventually break up. I dont want to be hurt and disappointed again because every time she showed me kindness,I thought she was turning a new leaf, and every time i was met with heartbreak. With a boyfriend, I now have a measure of when she will go back to “bad” mom. (Forgot to mention, but she also acts mean and belittles me when he is not present but this is only sometimes but not all the time. But she has never acted like that in front of him, also a fear factor!). But she has been acting so nice to me and I just know theres someone who is deeply hurt inside of her but I have just been avoidant/ghosting her subconsciously to protect myself. I hate the feeling of guilt and I also want to protect myself. Any advice? Anyone else have a similar experience? Anything would help really"
"As long as I can remember I feared my father, I'm turning 15 this November and had already planned my whole life (E.g moving out).

I have sensory issues and IBS meaning I'm sick often, I can remember him ruining events in my life like the Easter bunny. I have nearly ran away several times and feel like I want time to pass quickly so I can leave.He has victim blamed multiple times as well as made me sob in my room all night long. He'll get mad a different reasons and can be explosive. "
"So for context Im F16, I lived with my mom my whole life until 3months ago I moved into an amazing foster home. 
While I stayed w my mom I got abused ALOT through these years. In all ways an can image. 
My mom were never at home, she would work all day bc thats where the money comes. And she would often travel for days to meet up with guys, while I were left home alone, The first time I were only 4years. We also mooved houses about 30times in 12years. We almost never had food, and I would often go hungry. I had never experienced having dinner with people. And my mom never attend things at school , so I would be the only child without parents. 
I had to do all of the chores in a home at a very young age and take care of my siblings as If I were their mother.
When my mom would come home from work she would often be mad. All I can remeber is countless of times where she would hit me, choke me and break up the doors if I even tried to lock them. 
Through all these years she would tell me things a mother shouldnt tell their child. And I thought these things were right and normal.
List of things my mom repetietly would say:
- No one is ever gonna want you
- I do not want you
- I rather wanna die than have you
- You are misreable
- You are weak 
- You never make me happy 
- I wish I never birth you

These are very hurtful things for a child to hear, ecpecially it was for me. Because growing up and I still am a child who were always quiet and never did anything wrong. I never shouted or yelled at anyone.

"My very young sister is being abused and I need advice on how to move forward. I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and perhaps direct me to a better subreddit / give advice on how to deal w this situation. Please read below as details are important.

I'm an adult with an established life who lives ~ 20 mins away from my parents and very young (elementary school aged) sibling. As a child, I experienced mostly emotional abuse (to a pretty severe extent) mostly by my mother. There was  also multiple instances of physical abuse, one instance which left bruise marks on head and arms, exclusively done by father. He also physically abused my mother. I did not have contact with any family members except my parents, so there was no adult around to save me. I called the police on my father a few times but my mother would vouch for him even tho I had photographs of my bruises, so the police never did anything. As I grew up, my father chilled out and we developed a pretty good relationship, while my mother and I continue to have a very bad relationship. my father and I have suspicions that my mother has narcissistic personality disorder, and I myself have been diagnosed with borderline PD. My mother's verbal/emotional abuse has gotten worse (toward my sibling), and she treats my sibling much worse than she ever treated me. She does not abuse me anymore (I have basically completely cut her off). Given that my father had stopped abusing me and my mother, and I saw growth in him, I assumed that he had changed and felt safe leaving my sibling with my parents and moving out to start my own life, assuming he would step in the way I did when I lived at home. However, since I've moved out, my sibling has been telling me about increasingly bad instances of abuse, including my father physically abusing her once very recently. I have no doubt it will only get worse as it's following the exact same pattern as it did when I was younger, but to a greater degree now (she's younger than I was when it started, and my mother is much more abusive to her than she was to me). it's been horrifying seeing the same things that happened to me start happening to her. Naturally I'm extremely worried about her and realize that I am literally the only adult able to help her, and I don't think I could forgive myself if I didn't at least try to gain custody of her so she's away from these monsters. Please note I've started gathering evidence, asking her to take videos of them yelling at her and have taken vids of her telling me about the physical abuse (with her consent). 
Unfortunately, things aren't straightforward, as she ultimately still has deep attachments to her parents (she's very young and they are very good at brushing their abuse under the rug pretending like it's no big deal and having a great day the next day - think of an abusive relationship where love bombing follows the abuse then the cycle repeats). She doesn't want me to take custody of her even though we have a great relationship and I act as a parental figure to her anyways. She's also only a child and certainly unable to understand the ramifications of being abused as a child (I also thought it was horrible but didn't understand how much it fucked me up in the long term until I was much older).
I also am worried about actually having custody as I'm in school for my doctorate and barely have time to exist as-is. However, of course, I would put anything aside to ensure my sibling grows up feeling safe and loved unconditionally.
Lastly, I have a semi-good relationship with my father (he's good when he's not hitting women and children lol) and despite how stupid I feel saying this, I have a SLIVER of hope that maybe with therapy and anger management he may be able to improve that side of him. I am a bit worried about going through a custody battle and losing the last family I have left - him.
I truly don't know what to do. Hearing the stories, watching the videos my sister takes, and knowing this abuse is going on is taking a HUGE toll on me. It's like someone's tying my hands and forcing me to watch my sister be tortured and fucked up for life. She's adamant she doesn't want to separate from her parents, but I feel such a responsibility to do something about this (I'm also about to legally be a mandated reporter once I finish my degree). For now I've asked her to please not share details with me if she doesn't want my help, and to instead just tell me if she needs something physically (for me to pick her up, for me to make her food and drop it off for her if her mom doesn't feed her out of anger, etc.). But i still feel horrible telling a baby that she shouldn't tell me about the abuse she's experiencing (I am getting her a therapist but she can't really talk about the abuse without risking being reported). But I also can't hear it and it's severely impacting my mental health (again, I'm already not doing great given I have borderline personality disorder, and was depressed for most of my life - not anymore, and have had attempts at taking my own life). I truly don't know what to do in this situation, and am afraid to talk to anyone like a lawyer or therapist as they would likely immediately report.

Thank you so much if you read all the way to the end, and please drop any advice you have as I've truly never faced a situation where I've been stumped like this."
"I'm going to be a blunt as possible.  My dad was my abuser and although he isn't in my life anymore (and never will be), I have a hard time dealing with the fact I feel like I need him to pass before I'll get any peace of mind. He has a heart condition and is untreated,  so I find it becoming less and less of a hypothetical everyday,  but I was hoping for any advice or shared experiences to help navigate the following years,  or however long is left in his hour glass "
"Whenever I leave or go to work 9/10 my parents go through my things amd throw out or ""misplace"" my things or just yesterday she threw out a bunch of my plants because ""they were dead"". They were not. 

The late frost and heatwave had affected growing but if you actually LOOKED AT THE PLANT  you'd see the little green buds. When I asked where my things have gone they say ""I dont know I didnt touch it"" YET I HAVE VIDEO PROOF OF YOU TOUCHING MY THINGS (I don't say this because then theyll find the camera and break it again like last time)


I don't fucking know what to do

I'm so stressed all the time

I don't want to go home anymore

I have panic attacks over coming home and my things have been touched

I can't live like this

I just come home to shower and sleep now really

I hate being stressed all the time"
"My father is so fucking annoying. He wakes up irritated every single day then he makes sure that everyone in the house also has their day ruined. This motherfucker deliberately orders me around like a servant (it makes him feel as if he’s in power) he doesn’t work all he does is watch YouTube videos about health or hate speech and then he acts as if he’s the most knowledgeable person in the world. This absolute Karen literally told a doctor with years of studying and a fucking degree that he doesn’t know shit about his work. According to asshole dumb narcissist father, he has more knowledge than anyone just cuz he watched a few YouTube videos on a certain topic. Dumbass takes my gadgets away then screams and orders me around cuz I’m a “girl”. He doesn’t let me live in peace like never. Always fucking arguing and screaming. Telling me that I’m worthless because I’m not studying all the time when all he does and has been doing for 6 years is laying on the couch watching tv.i can’t concentrate on studying fuck that I can’t concentrate on anything. Whenever I try to do something he interrupts and tries to act as if he knows everything and tries to “correct me”. I fucking hate him so much why doesn’t he just die. Because of him my depression is kicking in and I’m only 16. I need to study to get myself out of her but I can’t even do that because he’s always hovering over me. "
"Hello,
I'm making this post because...well I don't actually know how to explain it because I'm not that good with English but I'd like to hear other people's opinions.


To sum up a long messy story, my mom had a rough childhood in a formerly communist country (she was well of but her mom died know childbirth and she blames her stepmom for a bad childhood but I've spoken to grandpa and step grandma and from their stories I personally think she was always a very angry and lazy person)

There was a whole messy deal when I was born because i was born in her second marriage (she was a bit wild in high-school and got pregnant at 16, she was forced to marry and had a divorce, she had 2 song in her first marriage)


My dads side of the family is poorer (we live in a village and most views are very close minded though because of dads dad who always blew away money and cheated, and from what i heard beat my dead grandma (dads mom) they had a bad reputation, it kinda sticks to you for a while is what I'm saying)
She married him and there they all had a deal that they'd raise the sons from her first marriage but mom got pregnant with me and there was this whole messy fight and I kinda grow up with a dad who'd get really drunk once in a while though he doesn't get angry often he has these massive explosive fits every once in a while and mom who's from what I belive very emotionally underdeveloped and whould always threaten me and beat me (sometimes we get into physical altercations, I just don't want her to keep hitting me and now im big enoughto defend myself)when I was younger. 

Once I started going to high-school I got super paranoid because I was really worried I'd let loose like her, get pregnant and basi stop living (mom and her ex had a joint custody, she had to pay him the child fee {I don't know the correct term sorry} and as a result refused to work and now can't have a credit card because she doesn't want to give the ex any money [I tried telling her to get a protected account but she doesn't want to let even 30% od her pay to go to him and always starts accusing me of hating and not knowing what im saying her when I try talking to her about it)
I just think she's a very bitter creature that's kinda mad I've got a semi normal life? But maybe I'm just a bitch.

My little sister tends to be feisty like her too and very argumentative (but I think that's because she's a teen)

Anyway...that was a long intro and I hope someone will read this through but sometimes I fear that im just like my mom and i hate it, today while I was packing I got really suspicious to leave for a new job when I couldn't find the envelope with some money I got as a gift and got angry at her (maybe I just don't like her but she used to steal the ""support"" money that i was getting for my good grades and would steal the tips I got from my part time job) I didn't blame her because I put a lot of effort in self control but I was angry and nervous and when some is angry with her she's angrier back...so I kinda threw out all the stuff out my suitcase and dug around my whole room. Somehow the envelope was on the floor even though I put it in the drawer (she always says I'm forgetful in this bitchy tone even though I never misplace things when I'm at work for example though I am a scatter brain sometimes)

Now she won't talk to me even though I tried to apologize (I'm usually very easy going with others but everything is a fight with her and she just brings out this anger out of me, I hate her sreaming)

Do you think I'm the problem? I keep thinking I'm the one ruining this family and even now as I write this I feel like I'm lying as I type this out and that I'm trying to get someone on my side)
For reference I'm a girl that just reached 20yo and I'm kind of an odd ball? (Well I think this would be the proper translation of the term in my Language) I'm unsure what to so with myself, don't know shit and don't think i can make it happen. I decided to take a job far away to get away from my hometown and family but like idk I'm afraid that I don't deserve it, please tell me what you think because I don't trust my brain at the moment and don't wanna mentally beat myself down.


But I still think I love them, my country is kinda known for being crazy and poor, so maybe I should just change my outlook on it or something.

Thanks again and sorry for the Grammer I did the best i can"
"My father is emotionally and physically abusive. He would yell threats like I'll break you legs, or tell me things like he and I are both good at taking advantage and lying to other people. Using them to get what we want. Some of the physical stuff he did to me and my siblings like picking me up by my shirt and slamming me against the wall. Or the time where he punched my little brother in the nose and gave him a nosebleed. He is a good kind man who cares I just fear him sometimes. He said he didn't have a father so he struggles to be one. Anyways, back to the title. I used to have nightmares. Of my brothers or my sister dying. Not by my father. But just dying. I dreamed that I was helpless and I was crying. These dreams continued for a while and then they stopped. They reappeared at other times as well. I think it's because as the oldest I am required to protect my siblings. These thoughts are physically painful.These thoughts and other things are weighing on my mind and twisting it every single day. You do not want to know the stuff that goes on in my head these days. It feels like my mind is getting worse and worse. I can go to no one. I've become a cold uncaring lier. I find it hard to connect and care for people, like my own siblings. Hopefully my parents don't find out about this post. (They monitor my phone, but I have found some loop holes I am 16m)."
"When I was in high school my mom threatened to beat me/ beat my butt everyday. 
She always told me if I snuck out she would be waiting at the door with a belt when I came back and if I ever left without permission or went to a party, tried alcohol, cig’s or drugs that my butt would beat. She also told me if I had sex I would also get beat. I would also be grounded for a very long time and life would be over as I knew it. 
I never did any of this so I never got in trouble but someone told me this was not ok and in high school I thought nothing of it. Would you consider this abuse? "

"# How bad is my situation compared to someone normal?

Last time I posted about my situation on reddit. The title is above here. I posted in it about how my father has abused me a lot in the past. And i didn't wanted to involve police in the matter. But the way he acts is the same, I expected a lot but found that he is manipulative, angry when i disobey or contradicts him, he is not capable of love, he always remind me of how he earned money for me, i tried to fight against him however i can but i never hit him ever. But he always hit me when I disagreed with him and then my family. I tried a lot to get him to change but it's not possible. Now i want to involve law enforcements. I am done with him. I will try to convince my family to report him. But some things to note is that:

He never hit me or anyone since he came to USA.

My family is scared of him.

My cousin is friendly towards him.

I need to get him away from my family once and for all.

Should I call the police.

Will they arrest him without any evidence. I will convince my family to tell the truth for once.

PLEASE HELP ME."
"


Hi All. I came to Reddit to rant/ get clarity as to handle this very very delicate situation. Ever since I was child I was abused by mother like crazy. She would hit me, she would throw cuss words at me and even went to the extent to get support from other members for her shitty ass behavior. 

I realized this was toxic and started taking the help that I need. But even then I have not been able to get over the trauma. 

Couple of years ago I moved out the country but then also she has this control over me. If I put a picture with my boyfriend she asked me to take it down, I wore a dress that showed cleavage, she was after me for months to change my display picture.

Now that I am happy and in a relationship, she is unable to digest that I am happy and she doesn't like the guy at all. I live with him now and she is trying to find out who I live with through my friends. She is really really stressing me out and I am scared the extent she would go to. 

She is someone who can't understand boundaries and needs to prove a point. She is narcissist and toxic af. She is out and about to destroy the relationships that I have with my friends by trying to get them to snitch on me. 

I am really helpless and don't know what to do. 

She is also someone who says "" After all I am your mother"" and gets away with it. "
"Im scared but I can’t go back now
There’s a cps report on the way"
"TW: Self harm, incest, child abuse

I’m an adult male and have a lot of intrusive thoughts about harming myself, issues with intimacy, substance abuse issues, and difficulties with functioning that a lot of people chalk up to autism, although tests don’t show I have autism (some kinds of PTSD can be misdiagnosed as autism). 
As a kid I engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with exclusively male peers, and tried to talk other boys into self-harming themselves in their genital region, which is a recurring intrusive thought for me even today.  

The most suspicious thing is how my father always talked in a very sexually-charged ways. This hyper-sexualized vibe even showed up when my father told me about the “birds and the bees” when I was far too young (maybe 6-7 y/o or younger). I also had not asked about this topic. He told me about “the birds and the bees” in a very graphic way that made me and my mother uncomfortable and continued talking despite my mother chiding him a bit. He also told me within this same conversation about a time where he got a girl drunk and stayed sober himself so he could “feel her up” when she was passed out.
It is really chilling to me that not only did he think it was appropriate to tell a child about sex in a super graphic way, but he also told me about him sexually assaulting somebody. 

My father is also a self admitted porn addict which was very much in my face when I was growing up; there’s even a picture in my baby photo album of my father (clothed) looking at porn with me as newborn sleeping on his shoulder. 
My father once talked about his porn watching habits around the dinner table when I was a teenager, and when my stepsister got super uncomfortable, he laughed off her concerns, and kept talking about it.

Another event was when I was around 8 y/o; my father came home drunk (he was a self described alcoholic) and talked to me a bit and somehow got to straddling me clothed and bouncing up and down on me in a very weird way that I think I registered as being weird even as a kid. 

My father also openly had a “crush” on a 16 y/o girl on a vacation I was with him on when I was around 10. He would take suggestive pictures of her all the time, told the girl’s father in front of me that he had a “crush” on her, and joked to her face about his “crush” on her.

Another reason I think some abuse may have happened to me is some of the aforementioned behavior as a kid. When I was 5-6 I talked a male peer into going into a bathroom and touching each other’s genitalia. Even weirder was a pattern of behavior where I tried to talk male peers into causing themselves pain in their genitalia. 
The first time was when I was maybe 5, and involved me placing objects on a slide so that it would hit my male peers in the balls. I remember referring to this as a “peepee torture” which is just so deeply alarming for such a young child.
Another time I tried to talk my male peer into putting ice in his swim trunks as well as put his genitalia in a jacuzzi pool jet.
Other solo things I did in this vein were tying things to my genitals and tying the other end to an elevator, and closing toys with sharp hinges on my genitals. 
I continue to have a recurring intrusive thought about causing harm to my genitalia. This is extremely alarming to me and some part of my difficulty with intimacy/extreme performance anxiety. 

You may ask what my mother was doing this whole time and the answer is nothing. When I asked her about some of my inappropriate behavior as a child (weird thing to ask my mother but I couldn’t find effective therapy and was doing really badly), and she blurted out that it was normal and told me a terrifying story about an unnamed male child engaging in incest with his sleeping unknowing sister (she told me the sex act the brother did to his sister too), telling me this horrifying story with the subtext of “all kids do weird things.” This story also reveals that my mom doesn’t really think that abuse is a big deal, it’s just a “weird, quirky thing.”

What do you think of this? Does it sounds like something may have happened? Or are my concerns explained some other way?"
"Ok so my relationship is not good with my mother she was never there and has done some stuff which ill not elaborate rn cause thats not the topic of discussion rn, ik she has hurt me and the childhood me in many ways and I recently decided to distance myself from her, but im thinking…. Does forgiveness help… i mean idk 
I know as a fact that i have no energy in my heart left to go back and fix stuff like literally i cant do that to myself anymore so idk can someone just tell me more about forgiveness and healing a relationship"
"Some needed context prior to this incident. When I was in 5th grade, there was this incident where I brought an old phone to class so I could play a game with my friends during recess. My mother allowed me to bring it to school but I think she never brought it up with my dad. Later during the day when my dad arrived home, he called me name and confronted me about it. I responded truthfully and he took out his belt and began beating the shit out of me. I was screaming in pain and shriveled into a ball on the floor. If it wasn't for my sisters intervening, I would've been sent to the hospital. That event left me scarred ever since. I've been avoiding my dad as much as I can since just looking at his face makes my fight or flight response activate. I don't know if it should be labeled as PTSD since I don't want to jump to conclusions.

Now for the incident that happened recently. I was watching my show while eating dinner and my dad just appears out of nowhere and starts bad mouthing it as he does with anything I watch/do. I just sat at the table debating if I should turn it off and leave or just sit there. I came to a conclusion and turned it off since he obviously didn't like the show (which was Haikyuu) and I just went to my room as I was done with my food. A few minutes later he barges in my room and starts yelling at me like ""why'd you turn of the TV why'd you fucking do that"" and I'm shaking and bawling my eyes out as he's yelling at me. He then picked up the mug on my table and threw water on me and just as the title says, he threatened to throw the mug at me. I'm sitting there on my bed having a panic attack and all my dad says is that I shouldn't be crying since he didn't hit me. My mom walks in and just doesn't do anything but when he leaves she just says I shouldn't be crying since I brought this on myself. I don't know if I really did bring this on myself or not."
"I tend to find it extremely easy to emotionally bond with and have empathy for animals, especially cats. But I tend to often find it harder to open myself up in that way to humans.

I suspect this is because, while my parents were often emotionally abusive or neglectful, we had cats. And our cats were always there for me. I always played with them. When I was sad I could cuddle up with them. Stuff like that.

And I have this feeling that cats being this emotionally supportive presence in my life whereas my parents were often not, and sometimes quite the opposite, is what caused me to feel this way about cats compared to humans.

Anyone else have something similar?"
"I genuinely need help. My parents think I’m going insane. Basically I had a lock on my door (it’s one of those metal slidey ones). I say had because my dad has broken two of them and now i use wooded lollipop sticks instead of the metal slider so no one barges in while im changing. 

This may sound narcissistic but Im very smart, I’m the smartest in my grade and I always get perfect scores in tests. I never ask my parents for help regarding school, I don’t have any allergies or phobias and I don’t create a fuss.

Today my dad barged into my room because I was getting stressed about what clothes to wear for an event- it was business casual and I only own hoodies and leggings. He proceeded to scream at me, block my door so I couldn’t leave and threaten to lock me up in a mental asylum. My mum came in and was crying, I started shouting because my room was very messy, I was wearing pyjamas, they weren’t letting me leave, I was on my period so mood swings, I had a migraine etc..

For about an hour they screamed at me and I won’t deny that I screamed back. My mum kept saying that I was “too anxious” over nothing. She’s convinced that I have anxiety and yet they’ve never took me to a therapist or whatever. All my friends with things like that get counselling in school. 

I don’t like celebrations where I’m the centre of attention for example my birthday. I asked if we could just treat my birthday like any regular day this year but they refused. My mum said it was ok and that I didn’t have to do anything and yet today she said that something was wrong with me because I couldn’t even open birthday presents in front of my family. 

I said that I couldn’t look at them the same and that I planned to leave the house as soon as I could and never come back. She started hysterically laughing at me while I was sobbing and said that I was being dramatic. 

Unfortunately I have to live here for three more years, but im going to look into getting emancipated. I’d like to get therapy or something but idk. I feel like i could be way worse, im a perfect student, I barely complain and I get things done. I don’t understand why everyone makes such a huge fuss over me not being social, and not liking attention. Yeah it’s unusual but I don’t think it makes me insane? 

I can’t give much more info for fear of them finding me but I will try answer any questions. I genuinely want people to be honest, if you think I’m a psychopath tell me the truth and tell me what I can do. "
"I have always viewed my mum as safe and like she was going through the same thing as me so it felt like she understood. I have now slowly come to the realisation that she was an adult and I was only a child and she should have protected me against his abuse, she completely ignored the fact he was abusing me and ignored the signs that I was suffering. She saw my self harm and did and said nothing to me as she knew his abuse was the cause and she had no intention of addressing it "
"I am not sure what to do in this situation, I feel so lost and confused and like there is no escape. I just want to let it out, it hurts keeping it as a secret for 20 years. 

My mother and I have always been close, and on a good and normal day when she doesn’t drink, she is my closest friend, almost like the Gilmore Girls. She is very dramatic, eccentric, and childish. However the moment she drinks, she gets extremely violent and says a lot of mean things to me that I am unable to forget, no matter how much time passes or the amount of times she says she is sorry. 

I am a very shy person, who is really quiet. But I also get angry easily and that is because my mom knows all of the trigger words that result in my becoming short tempered, for example blaming me in every situation (we were at the store, she wanted to get a cola but forgot and she blamed me for not reminding her) 

Ever since I was a kid, my mother would turn into an extremely childish person who would want to be in the center of attention after a few drinks and would do silly things, like sing, dance, pee on the floor, etc. I always tried to stop her from the embarrassment or looking like an idiot infront of people, but then she would get focused on me and start to attack me, a lot of times verbally. My moms “abusive” nature would come out even when she doesn’t drink, like if I would spill something she would beat me up, so I would always try to wipe any spills or drops with my sock when I was 4. 

So here a few situations: 

1. My father and mother were arguing, like a usual couple. But my mom would take it in a wrong way and instead of being an adult, she would victimize herself and say that she wasted 20 years of her life on me and him. She would hit my dad and when my dad isn’t at home, she would take it out on me. In one of the instances, she once hit me with a belt and the metal part hit my eye. I had to go to the first day of school with a black eye.

2. Whenever my mom drinks she would say things like “I would have aborted you”, “you have no friends, my teacher tells you how much all of your friends hate you”, “you are an abusive sad person”, “I hate your voice, it is your own fault”, “because of you I wasted 20 years of my life”, “you are loser and you have achieved nothing”. 

3. As a kid, she left me alone with babysitters to go out with her friends to bar or clubs and come back late and pass out. My mother and I didn’t have a relationship whatsoever as a kid, and alot of time I felt as though she resented me. It felt like I had to compete with her for my fathers attention and she would on purpose make me uncomfortable by walking around the house in sexy lingerie or tell me that she wants to have sex with my dad and I have to leave the house. All of that would make me super uncomfortable and as a preteen it made me angry that she would tell me stuff like that, so I fought with her a lot. My dad would side with me, but my mom would say “of course the two of you protect each other, I am alone” type crap. 

4. She would kick me, throw chairs at me, and when I was super mad and took her phone away because she was calling random people to complain about how I am a very bad person, she grabbed a knife and told me to give back her phone. She was extremely drunk then.

5. Every time she would mess up, she would reverse the situation and gaslight me into thinking none of it happened and i imagined it because I am an egotistical person and that I am abusive. After a few rounds of arguments regarding the fact that I am a bad person and she is the victim, she would constantly tell me to come and to hug her and she would say “forget about it, we are both at fault. I love you” but my heart would ache from the pain I had to endure. 

Just last night she came back from a wedding drunk, and we had a very bad fight. She did her usual, do something stupid to make me mad, I get upset and tell her to stop doing something, she verbally insults me, I tell her to go to sleep, I grab her and make her go to her room, she attacked me and I had no sleep,cuz she kept coming to fight. She woke up and blamed me from being physical with her and that she is scared of me. 

What the hell should I do? "

"So I'm not really sure how to word this or what you would consider this but I'm still kind of shaken up but we've been having problems with one of my dogs for a while because he's been obsessed with my smaller dog and barks a lot randomly, the smaller dog is mine but the one we're having trouble with is my parents dog. Their dog started barking and my stepdad got mad so he got up and rushed over at him, he tried to kick him in the side but I think he missed and then said he was gonna start using his shock collar to shock the hell out of him ""just because"" in his own words, i feel sick to my stomach. My stepdad has never been violent to me except verbally when he felt I was being disrespectful but he has with my sister and his dog, I already know I'm gonna get some stuff telling me to reach out to somebody about this but my entire family would deny anything and it would only put me in a bad position. I just want to talk to somebody about this, I feel terrible for not doing anything. I'm sorry if I've come to the wrong place, I don't want to disrupt a community I just don't know."
"I have a situation, a friend of mine F(20), she is and always has been a model student and daughter who always puts her family first and scores the top grades through school and college with her teachers and colleagues singing her praises to her parents.

She is being mistreated by her ungrateful parents who are hell bent on controlling her every living moment and decesion, she has no social life because of them and if once in a blue moon she tries to go out with her friends it becomes into a whole fiasco with her parents and younger brother berating her about how she doesn't care about her family's reputation even though she has never done anything to put even a blemish on it and has only raised it ever since she could think on her own.

Her brother on the other hand who she naively cherishes and would do anything for is an ungrateful son of a bitch who only takes and takes from her, is a failure in every scope of his life takes advantage of her love and makes demands of her like he deserves anything but a slap. Though anychance he gets he creates doubt in her parents mind about her character and how she might be talking to her boyfriend anytime she is on a call or is spending time with him anytime she is even half an hour late to come home from work. 
All he does for her is put fuel in the fire that she is trapped in.

Her parents though act all progressive and liberal about how she is the apple of their eye and how they ask in front of their relatives but in the walls of their own home they threaten her by saying that they will marry her off anytime she does something on her own volition, something that makes her happy and even her brother adds to it and often suggests it himself, they say that she may do anything she likes after she is married off. 
When she says that she has a job a college life that she is committed to they say that it doesn't matter and she can just stop going.

All in all they want to tie her up and never let her leave the house, she is not even able to go at the end of her street without being bombarded by questions.

Her father puts up her every act as a threat to his reputation even though it is her brother who is very well capable and willing to drown it and she has only glorified his so called reputation ever since she was 10. She helped him in his business, taught him how to use his own fucking computer when she was 12 but all of that is either forgotten by them or they don't care and are just ungrateful bastards.

As her friend I want to make them pay, atleast realise what kind of gem their daughter is because I am not kidding or overdoing it one but that she is the kind of daughter people pray for and someday I might too.

Please give me ideas or another way so that I can help this friend of mine."
"So for context my sister lives a few cities away and I live 10 minutes next to my parents. I am always there for them and help them as much as I can. I’ll readily help them whether that’s financially or housework. My mother has recently had surgery and needs help so I spent the day cooking a big batch of food to give to them. It’s not the first time I’ve done that. I tend to help a lot more since my sister hardly comes down to see us. Yesterday my uncle (mum’s brother) his wife and son came to see her. She commented that I’m a good cook however my sister is a better cook since she lives far away. This upset me a lot. Not sure whether it should or not because I don’t felt like she was undermining me. After they left I calmly explained to my parents and their replies were “you act like we should be grateful that you’re here and your sister is not” and also “don’t bother cooking anymore.” I’m not sure where I went wrong or if I was being touchy. Their replies hurt me more rather than understanding that actually they upset their daughter.

"I’m 17 and I really needed to make some money to save up for a car. I sent some applications to a few places but got no answer from any. My mom told me to get a job where she works at so I applied and got the job. During the interview, the manager  slightly mentioned that he knows how hard my mom works (also complimented her on a few other things) and because he knows how hard my mom works he assumed that I will be the same. Though I can agree she’s a hard worker, him praising her really upset me. He praised her on how nice and respectful she was and I couldn’t help but feel awful. I know this might be stupid and he only knows her as a good hardworking employee and not a physically and emotionally abusive mother and I know it’s not his fault but him praising her really just upset me. It just sucks to see her get praised when she’s so awful to me and my siblings.  I know that at work she’s so nice and her coworkers like her but I just can’t wrap my head around the fact that she’s so kind at work and calm but she gets home and gets upset at the smallest reason and starts yelling. I know that it’s dumb for me to get upset knowing that her coworkers have no idea how she really is but I can’t help myself."
"I. 17F, am planning on going abroad for my degree. Not necessarily out of my country but out of my state, in order to pursue psychology as none of the colleges in my town or state are any good for psychology. My parents on the other hand, insist that it is not necessary and that they would miss me when I'm gone. I don't understand why people who have abused me for so long and say they regretted giving birth to me can't think logically whenever it comes to my future. I understand that they'd miss me but isn't it important for me to grow and be independent? Sometimes they're overbearing and other times they're assholes. I don't know how to convince them to go abroad. Esp since they're still deadset on me pursuing medical, even tho I have made it very clear I do not wish to do so. They keep insisting its because my future will be good, filled with money and I'll be successful, even though being happy is also my priority. How do I convince my parents to let me study psychology abroad?"
"So came here to say that when i was 8 yrs old it was my sis birthday and i so wanted to film/record my sis and dad singing happy b-day when i was recording my mom took the record cam out of my hands.

"Before I narrate my experience, I want to clarify that I live in an Asian country where women can’t move out of their homes unless they’re moving ou of city/country or until they get married.

My mother and I were extremely close during my early childhood. Since my birth, my parents had shifted to another city in which we had no family, due to my father’s job. As an only child, I grew extremely comfortable of having only them around and was very attached to both of them. However, even then my mother had always been extremely strict and critical, for example she’d always expect me to be at the top of my class and I remember being scared of not coming first because “what would my mother think of me”. Regardless, I had a very codependent attachment style with her and remember loving her a lot. All of that changed when my father took retirement and we were supposed to shift back to my parents’ previous hometown. 

My mother and I shifted a few months earlier than my dad, and I was only 11 at that time. The only place she could think of staying was at her own parents’ home (who had died), and this is also where her sister resided with her family. We took the upper floor, but my world turned upside down when my mother’s sister started abusing me in every way imaginable (except sexually). Sometimes, she would mock me and ridicule me for my appearance, and when I’d complain, she would beat me up relentlessly. Shoes, belts, slaps, punches, you name it. Other times, she would just call me “disobedient” and use that as an excuse to beat me up. In all of those occasions, my mother never intervened. She never protected me. She never even stepped in and said, “stop what you are doing to my daughter.” She’d just watch me getting beaten up and then later come to me and tell me that “it’s for your own good”. When I’d threaten them that I would call and tell my father, they would lock me up and prevent me from speaking to him. All of my calls with him would be monitored, in fact, whenever my father’s siblings would visit and we would visit them, I’d be told to not tell them anything personal because “we shouldn’t tell anyone what goes on at home. What happens at home is private and can’t be discussed.” Once my father moved in with us, things got better for a while until it started again, in other ways. My father got another job and he’d be away for most of the day. If my aunt wouldn’t hit me, I’d be ridiculed, shamed for absolutely everything, I used to love sketching at the time and she would mock me for being so bad at it and I remember once that she saw a sketch made by me, tore it up, and threw it on the floor, and then she brought the broom, and put it in the trash. I don’t remember sketching after that day. Even during those incidents , my mother never stepped in. Instead, when I’d try to fight for myself, she would scold me and then later force me to apologise to her sister. When my father would step in, he’d get thrashed by my mother. 

A couple of years later, my father bought and built a home for us to move into, and that’s when my nightmare came true. My mother’s sister decided to move in with us. She used the excuse that she had to sell her parents home as my mother wanted her share of the property and somehow she was our responsibility now. My father had absolutely no say in the matter as my mother had made his life hell also. Why he never took a divorce, I will never understand and maybe that’s the only thing I will never forgive him for. In our new home, my aunt tortured me just as much. I was 15 then. Once, when I fought back, she tried to suffocate me with my own pillow. I remember my mother meekly asking her to not to do it. She also scratched me on my face and I remember having a giant scar on my eyebrow, and my mother blackmailed me into not telling anyone why I got it. I don’t understand how or why I obeyed her, but I did. I told no one.

They moved away a couple months after that. It wasn’t because of what she had done to me, but because her husband could finally afford to pay rent in a separate home. The physical abuse stopped and hasn’t happened to this day. She was always a tormentor though, and is to this day. Since my mother is still pretty close to her, she is often visiting our place and sometimes she says or does something because of which I fight back. Even after all these years, my mother never took my side. My relationship with my mother never got fixed because of this. She never defended me, and I will never forgive her for it. 

Last week, an incident occurred because of which I had to intervene and I did so in a very calm manner. Next thing I know, my aunt called, screamed at me and called me names before cutting the calls. I was not at all disrespectful, even though considering the monster she is, I should have been. My mother was listening to all of this and her next move wasn’t at all surprising. She called her sister and started taking her side, and after that call when I screamed at her about her sister being such a monster, my mother had the audacity to scream at me and asked me to shut up.

Since that fight, my mother and I have not spoken. In fact, after pulling verbally abusing me, her sister had the audacity to come over to our place and taunt me again, but this time I was firm and fought back equally, which pissed my mother off even more. What broke my heart most was how my mother was sitting with her sister having coffee, and the only thing I could think of was “I would never sit with my daughter’s abuser, much less give them my time of the day.” 

In previous incidents when something like this occurred, I try my best to communicate with my mother later. I try to tell her how much her actions have traumatised me and how my entire life has been affected by her lack of protecting me, and each time she promises to do better. Either that, or she finds horrible excuses to defend herself or even her sister. If nothing else, she asks me to “forgive and forget.” 

I have been to therapy, and I have tried everything in the book to help myself get through this. I want to break free of this constant pain of feeling unsafe. I have occasional nightmares and wake up crying and screaming, and in all of those nightmares, what hurts more isn’t that my aunt is abusing me, but that my mother never defends me. I cannot move out of the country because my father is old and sick and the only family I really have. I love him enough to give up everything else in the world. But all this pain is making me go insane and I no longer know what to do. I don’t involve my father usually because of his health problems, but when I do, he stands by my side and fights for me, but it is pointless because my mother is extremely controlling and emotionally blackmails everyone. 

I want to clarify that it may seem that my mother is lonely and dependent on her sister, and that is not true. It may also seem that my mother is in an abusive marriage which could explain why she thinks it’s okay to tolerate abuse, and that is also not true. My father, although not the most romantic man on earth, has never even spoken to my mother in a loud tone. He has always been caring, loving, and supportive despite my mother treating him like absolute shit.

I am a 14-year-old boy, and my older brother is my favourite, and I had no problem with him. We were very close until he reached the second grade of middle school. Strange things began to appear in his behavior. He treated me like a monster, and he kept hitting and cursing at me. I used to say that this was normal, this was my teenage period, and my mother was like that.   when he reached the third grade of middle school. My fate changed and he started beating me unreasonably, as if I was torturing him the time I reached him. He  broke my leg and my body is all bruised. When one of my friends suddenly says I say don’t know or I fell and he keeps hitting me, he is upset. For example, I am sitting in the safety of God, and he gets into a stressful situation and gets up. He beat me, and my mother does not know how to deal with us, and unfortunately I do not know how to defend myself, and he hits me, bringing out all the anguish and resentment in his heart. Unfortunately, these words are not in front of my father, and since a month ago, my brother has been tired, and I have been taking care of this, and when he is very tired, he is upset and goes to hit me. I have been getting better throughout the month, and his beatings have increased greatly. When my father found out, he said, “I am the one who made a mistake and want to create problems out of nowhere.” When I show him all the beatings and bruises. he tells me, “You are definitely not annoying him.” But by God, I have not done anything to him. In the past two weeks, the beatings have been a lot and severe. As for psychologically and physically, I have perished and I have accumulated some money. Should I rent a small room to live in alone? And  work, but I don't cut  relationship with my mother. and I really need your help. I hope someone comes across what happened to me and tells me a solution, and I will be very thankful. I'm sorry that I took so long with you"
"(P.S. this is long I’m sorry!!!)

So I am a 16 year old male, well I’m trans. Female to male. Only a few people in my family know this information due to my family being either heavily conservative and that means they come with being homophobic. Basically I live with my grandma due to my mom leaving when I was pretty young and my dad passing when I was around 8. I am the youngest out of three.

Ever since then, my grandma has normally been nice. She got mean when my older brother neared 15 and he started to act out. She clearly took her anger out on him and hit him, yelled etc.
Well he moved out when he turned 18, no hesitation. She skipped over my older sister and went straight to me- she says it’s because I’m like my mother and no one likes my mother.

Lately it’s been getting worst, normally she would yell insults at me but now she’s hitting, throwing things and leaving bruises just for the smallest things. 

Yes I’ve been on contact with CPS, multiple times but they do little to no help. They constantly just saying she is grieving since my dad is her son. And I’m not disregarding her grief, it’s real, I know trust I know.

Some more back story, a lot has happened to me from starting around 5 years, my mom being a raging alcoholic and drug addict and kidnapping me and my siblings on multiple occasions, seeing my dad bash a man’s head into a wall until he was just blood and brains, my dad getting cps called on him by my mom, being sa’d by my brother when i was 6-8, and so much in my teenage years to now. I go to therapy but it seems like it doesn’t really help, I have diagnosed severe depression, severe anxiety and severe PTSD. My grandma knows this, she just doesn’t care at all, she doesn’t believe in that stuff.

With her doing more physically abusive lately, it’s really been declining my mental state and that plus working long shifts isn’t helping, she also doesn’t allow me to take my antidepressants anymore. My therapist is also not available this whole month. I’m not sure how to deal with it anymore."
"So my parents especially my mom suck ass as parents so so much.
My English is not my native language but I'll try my best to explain 
So my parents are both pretty abusive people they've both abused me and my brothers both physically and emotionally.
They've went through my things , they've thrown all my childhood drawings some bc they were LGBTQ.
Nice my mom Almost strangled me ,thank God I had a scarf.
She pulled my hair just bc I forgot to do something she insulted me.
My dad in the other hand is also a natural douchebag he beated me and my brothers when we were little as""teaching "" juet because we didn't understand the subject .they've once locked me in a dark room as a form of""punishment"".I once hated them but now I don't but that doesn't mean I love the heck no.
I'm planning to leave when I'll be 18 
They are the only people that I think that deserve to be respected 
I've tried to tell them that beating is not an ""education"" but they called me an hypocrite.
My mom blames us for nothing and uses it to take our things as a form of ""punishment"" just because weve made her mad.this woman has the audacity to ask us why don't want to spend time with them like are you kidding me.i'm tired living with these two. My father once said just because I told them that choosing a school for my brother and not letting him making his choice ,but that douchebag of my father started a whole stupid argument about him being older and that he knew more that us that we are stupid blah blah blah.im so sick to even stay next to my parents, I'll definitely cut them off for  good 😊 
The court called social workers on my name I sincerely don't know how it happened but I couldn't say anything to the social workers bc my mom was next to me....I can't take all this shit anymore  "
"before i start i just wanted to apologize if anything i say doesnt make sense. i have a very hard time wording things properly, especially when im talking about something sensitive :') so pls bare with me. 

  
growing up i never really had a good relationship with my father. after i turned 8 (19f) i think is when our relationship started getting bad. he used to yell at me just to come into the living room so he could yell at me (again) about my weight, which to be fair i was a bigger kid but our family's diet didnt help that one bit. my father liked having meat (red meat), potatoes, and a slice of bread every night after work and he hated it when my mom and i would eat something else. he'd go on about how theres no point in us even eating as a family anymore if we dont eat the same meal. oh and if supper wasnt ready when he got home (he got home at around 4-5pm, he owns a roofing company so he controls his hours) he would pout about it for hours on end and accuse my mom of trying to starve him all day because he refused to eat during the day despite being diabetic. 

another thing that was an issue with my weight was my insulin resistance which i didnt even know i had until recently. anyways because of my insulin resistance my neck used to be really dark and my dad thought that was because i wasnt washing myself properly so he would make my mom scrub my neck everyday for months until my neck was bleeding and it would be a scab the next day. no one thought that they shouldve brought me to a doctor even once. 

he also found it entertaining to torment my mom and i 24/7. we spent most of our summers traveling on the road and camping with family, and his favourite thing to do was either grab me or my mom and yell really really loud to scare us while he was driving, and me and my mom both have severe anxiety so you can imagine how it affected us. 

my father was also just really weird towards me. i remember this one morning i was getting ready for my schools picture day (i was in grade 2 or something like that so this was still very exciting and fun for me) so i spent all morning picking out my outfit and curling my hair with my mom (we put sparkly hairspray in my hair and i loved it) and the first thing my dad did was look me up and down, whistle, and called me sexy. this happened 2 maybe 3 more times. he even called one of my younger cousins from another province sexy. she was like 2 or 3 maybe.

we had a lot of horses when i was younger and my father had a close friend who was a farrier (he put horse shoes on horses and trimmed their hooves and stuff) and everyone had this running 'joke' (i dont think it was actually a joke but this is what everyone said it was so i say it was) where i was dating the farrier (i'll call him R in this post ig) and there were so many times where he would grab me and sit me on his lap and sometimes my parents would leave me in the barn alone with him and he would try kiss me and touch me. my mom never said anything about what was happening and my dad always laughed it off and called me R's girlfriend himself.

i also had a niece who's older than me by 2 or 3 years and when i was 6 she would get me to sneak out to our old farm trucks to smoke cigarette butts, and when we were home alone (my sister would bring her to my dads so we could play together) she would turn on a porn channel on the tv and make me watch with her. there were hundreds of times where we got caught but no one ever said or done anything, it was always a quick ""oh! you shouldnt be watching that."" and someone would switch the channel and move on. though we did get caught smoking and we got into DEEP shit for that (one of my sisters smelt cigarette smoke in the basement one morning and told my dad). 

im sorry if this is a huge mess with grammar and spelling mistakes. i have only shared this with my therapist and i have tried to talk to my mom a few times so i can maybe get some closure on some stuff but everytime i have she either plays it off, calls me over dramatic, or invalidates me. i wanted to try lift the weight off my shoulders at least a little more than i have with my therapist. because of the things i had to put up with my mental health has had a tight grip on my life but i think im finally starting to slowly heal :) "
"14F, my moms hit and intimidated me since i was younger, never taught me boundries, never taught me what was right or wrong. just yelled at me for doing wrong. they didnt treat my cat right. and neither did i (he died when i was 10 from some sort of poisioning?  since he went outside alot and i didnt rlly know that was wrong either.)  i feel guilt for the way i treated my cat even though i didnt wanna hurt him. i looked after kittens before and im scared i somehow abused them without realising. my friend dropped one kitten bc it scratched her. obviously i got mad but it was an accident. we tried to comfort the cat but the black kitten didnt really like being touched (this was a year ago?) i used to always pick them up and stuff. they meowed alot but idk if that means they hated it or not..i never hurt them or anything. i just wish i stopped bothering them. i dont trust myself at all and constantly blame myself even though id never abuse a cat or hurt anything. or try traumatise one. i love animals.

i feel horrible that i couldnt do anything abt how they treated my childhood cat. i was so clingy and so aggressive (not to hurt but i was never told it was bad so i used to pull him, playfight with him (not aggressively js gently) scare and chase him, spray him , put stuff on his head , like in those vids where some sort of teabox or smth is on the cats head. i was around 7. i never kicked or hit him (from what i remember. i still dont trust myself though.)  i used to tell my family to stop whenever they shouted at him or was mean to him but i couldnt do much about it. and my cat always used to scratch me really hard but i js thought it was ""Playing"" not signs of uncomfiness or scared.  i even remember searching up ""im scared i abused my cat"" when i was like 9 years old. because i blamed myself for everything. ive had anxiety like that sicne i was little  so thats all  i passed it off as. i just thought "" i love him and id never hurt him so im just being stupid!"" even a few days ago my friend brang up ""we just use to drop ur cat off ur stairs. (like a few steps up)"" and i said ""yes but we didnt throw him and we weere young"" i just panicked because i didnt know if it was wrong. and now my brains telling me i was excusing my behaviour.

thats just one part.

my mom scares me and hits and hurts me. she acts like a normal loving mom alot of the time but shes literally tackled , threatened , hit, chased, thrown things, screamed, intimidated, locked me outside.  never really monitered my internet or behaviours, didnt find it a ""big deal"" when i was SA/D by my ex friend and used it to just send hate to her family bc she didnt like them.  constantly had police over when my mom and sister fought and i cried bc i thought i was gonna be taken away. my mom used to say things like ""ill smash ur head into a wall"" from even when i was REAL YOUNG.,during our family holiday in 2022? she was physically fighting my aunt and other family with a literal bed leg?  they both were. she came up to me (i was crying) and said ""im going to kill her."" (referencing to my aunt) . the next family holiday (this year) was fine up till the last day. they screamed and my mom threw something at my nan. i snapped and shouted back. i usually do this anyways.

my mom saw me making sexual stuff on a game when i was 10 and all she did was scream and tell my sister to monitor everything i did. even tho she couldnt give a shit about me anyway.

this behaviour has passed onto me. im not excusing what i did, people ive upset have a right to be mad obviously.. but i cry everytime i realise i snapped at a friend, or my bf. without realising. and i upset them. its become so bad that ive noticed i lie abt almost everything, even trauma. just to feel valid. ive put myself in situations where i hoped something traumatic would happen because for some reason i wanted that attention? ive split constantly on my bf, become attached to him. hes taking a break now and honestly he might not even come back. i try to please people who hurt me because i hate being hated. i hate being misunderstood.

ive said and done so many horrible things to the point i feel i dont deserve life. or love. i have the urge to leave everyone

im not including a big chunk of whats happened to me bc alot of it isnt relevant to the sub

i should hate u mom. i should hate u family.  but i dont. i love them and have fun and make jokes with them. im a piece of shit overall. i dont know how i even have people around me."
"I'm not close to my dad. Not one bit. I don't know his passions, what he lives to do, what his life goals are, his type in women, nothing at all. He's distanced himself from us about the time me and my sister hit puberty, and I've made another post before on this sub where I mentioned he makes us cover up at home, please read that for more context.

I want to stalk my dad on Facebook using a fake account. Not just looking at his posts and stuff, I want to actively engage with what he posts, in a way that could make him reply to my interactions and I could get a look into his life, his values, his morals. From what I've seen from our miniscule interactions, he doesn't seem to respect women much.

The thing is I don't know how I should go about this. Should I make a catfish woman account? Should I make a troll fake account to see what triggers him? Should I make a preaching account to somehow change him (even though I know I probably can't)? I want to do SOMETHING that could make me know truly the kind of person he is. Please give recommendations, advise, suggestions, etc etc. Thank you.


Also, there's a problem with this. I'm afraid he finds out that account is me. I know that sometimes FB accounts tend to sync to phone numbers. So how do I avoid having him find out that I'm from his contacts and potentially find out its me? I could actually be physically harmed...



(Optional read) before I get comments like ""why don't you talk to him directly"" I physically cannot. Long ass story which i can explain in private. I just feel so much anxiety when I talk to him. I can't. It's too mentally draining for me."

"I posted here more than two weeks ago about my abusive mother. She's over it, but I'm not. And I can't stop thinking about it after what she's done today.

  
Me and my mother are both doll collectors. Well, I was. She likes to collect expensive and rare vintage dolls that will probably get Thanos snapped if any of her three children touch them. I like to collect any dolls that I feel a connection with, and she for some reason thinks they're for my sisters as well. I'm not surprised, her and father think my room is a playroom. She gave me some of her dolls as a present. Most of them weren't really expensive or rare, except for like two. But I loved them.

  
Last fight she took 14 of them away. And they were laying in her room, in a bag like trash. She took all dolls she deemed pretty and all dolls she could find (some were in different parts of my room). They spent two weeks away. In these two weeks I've realized I'm done. I don't need her shit anymore. Today she casually brought this bag in, saying ""oh I put some of them into my collection, here, take the rest"". Half of them were missing. And coincidentally, they were either cheap, hand-made or POC (my mother is racist). I told her I don't want them but she put them into my room anyway.

  
I feel so hurt. She never apologized. She took what's mine, she hurt me and doesn't care. My heart aches so bad and my hands are shaking. Am I overreacting?"
"I’m writing this as I’m coming to the realization that I will be leaving my two younger brothers with my father who is verbally and physically abusive towards us. Since I was born my dad has been verbally and physically abusive. He would get mad when things did not go his way or when he did not like how events played out. I did not know this behavior was not normal until one day when I was younger and he had hit me and told me to cover up the next day before school so that no teachers took me away. He would only hit me when I did “bad” things as a child, misbehaved, or got bad grades in school. He wanted me to be this perfect child. The same went towards my sister who is two years younger than me. He always tells me “when I die you will be grateful and remember how I raised you” but that’s far from the truth. He did not hit my mother but he did verbally abuse her and my grandparents for years. He would call me all sorts of names and degrade me as he punished me for my “bad” behavior that I now know is things kids do at times like spill water on the floor or being scared of the dark.

I am currently 20 and I’m about to move out to be closer to my college campus. My sister who is just about to start college is going to be dorming at her new college. This leaves my two younger brothers age 13 and 8 to stay living with him. Although my dad is not longer as abusive as he once was and as strict, it is still pretty bad. I can’t stand the thought of leaving my little brothers to endure that type of physical and mental abuse. They are both the kind and shy. My youngest brother who is 8 has adhd and anxiety diagnosed by a doctor already which my dad does not believe. He says the doctors are wrong since “such things do not exist”. I can already see how scared my brothers are of him and I’m worried they will suffer the way me and my sister did when we were younger. I see how my dad screams, yells, berates, and even hits them but I’m too scared to say or do anything for fear of what he might say or do to me. He has threatened to hit me or kick me out. Since my brothers are financially dependent on my dad and mom I don’t know what to do. I want to step in and stop him from yelling or hitting them but I’m scared. I’m 20 years old but i still get scared of what he will do to me. I can’t even hate him properly since he is still my dad. 

I just need advice on what to do.

"I’m not sure where it all began but the earliest I can remember is when I was being groomed, it was from the ages of 9-12, I’m 17 now. She found out about it and called the cops on the guy. Now sure that seems like a decent parenting move until after she made the call. She came into my room, dragged me by my hair and told me that “The only person you should be calling Daddy is your father and that I’d never know what a penis would feel like. Who would say that to their kid, let alone a 12 year old?

 Sure I was a dickhead kid and tried sneaking on my devices after she took them all away but it was only to contact my school friends. She noticed the tablet was gone and came into my room so I pretended to be asleep. She saw it as I was trying to get back in contact with the guy that groomed me so her best idea was to tell me to “wake the fuck up” and when I wouldn’t move she started beating me. Of course she took the tablet away from me but what is beating me senseless gonna do. It didn’t stop there either.

 The summer after I caught myself trying to run away because of an argument we had over my room being a complete mess. She had kept bickering with me over it and I wasn’t having it so I told her to leave me alone and she went batshit. She took one of my mason jars filled with beads and smashed it at my feet. Of course I stepped in it while closing my door and I decided I was going to leave through the fire escape. I ran all the way to my friends house and she tracked me there and had the police called. My whole family showed up and she took my phone away.

 We’ve gotten into many petty arguments since and I have been trying to avoid her until tonight. My sister follows in my mothers footsteps and is like her little pet. She snitches and me and all types of other shit. She got me in trouble over a charger which caused my mom to go on a rant about how I am disrespectful and spoiled and the least I could do is help out with my sister. Which I do indeed do, more than I should have to. If she goes to work at 8am and wakes up at 7am, my sister is awake at the time so why not feed her before you leave. She takes 15 minutes to get ready.

 Every time I try talking to her she ends up venting about herself and I hate it. She tells me that I can talk to her yet makes it about herself all the time. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety yet whenever I try explaining to her that I can get myself out of it on my own she gets mad and starts taking away the things I like doing as if they’re a distraction. With the way she acts I’m scared of even moving out when I turn 18 in fear of what she’ll do to my stuff or me to make it so that I can’t.

Yes, I do realize that she cannot legally do that but it’s hard for me to get the courage for it. I’ve told many people and I have gone to the police about it a few times but they have always taken her word for it over mine because she’s an adult. I know for a fact that all my nearby relatives that could take me in while I’m not with her are on her side and they see me as disrespectful and lazy because of the things she tells them about me. 

She has made threatening remarks in the past month about “blacking out” on me or punching me in my face. Or even going as far as saying she’d drag me down the stairs by my hair. She’s made many comments regarding my body and how we need to get in shape though she had to get surgery to lose hers and doesn’t even go through with it. She will go days without buying groceries and claims that she’s depressed and stressed about work and compares it to my diagnosis at every opportunity she gets.

 I don’t know what to do as far as taking action to get out and I’ve been seeking help for the longest. Reddit is my only option at this point, I barely use this app to begin with lol."
"My mom often puts me down by stating things like ""I'm irresponsible"" or that ""I don't care about anything"" and it honestly makes me really mad and upset.... if I fiercely tell her to stop because it hurts my feelings, she'll think I'm just talking back and being disrespectful. How do I very nicely tell her to keep quiet and not say things like that, because they make me feel like maybe I AM irresponsible, and that's not good for my self-esteem? In a way where she actually listens and stops."
"My mom was abusive and a drug addict. She abused and starved me, locked me in a room, and pretty much lowered me down to nothing but a maid. My siblings grew up calling me “slave” until I was 13 years old. 
I left my moms to go live with my dad who wasn’t in my life before. I was 17. Everything was going so well until I found out he’s a domestic abuser. He beat my stepmom and really hurt her when my child was 2 months old. Everyone forgave him (I was iffy) and he seemed to really be working on himself and bettering his mental health. I was so willing to give him another chance and have a relationship with my daughter (never leaving him alone with her though, ever). He did it again recently. 
Cutting him off hurts me, but I’ve already cut off my own mother so it’s something that I’m used to. However, what hurts the most is knowing my baby is going to grow up not knowing either of her biological grandparents. I’m so thankful that my stepmom took on the role of grandma and loves her, but I know one day she’s going to ask questions about my parents and that’s going to be a hard conversation. I know it’s the best thing for her, but it shouldn’t have been this way in the first place. She was just getting to the age where she knew “grandpa” and had gotten so attached to him, and it really breaks my heart for her. Idk, this shit is just so hard. "
 After so long of being a fucking control freak this is the first time he was ever in my level to talk to me. He's always dismissed my autism saying it's something I'll grow out of. He said finally that it's ok that I have problems. It's ok. I still have issues but honestly this is the most happy tears I've cried in my life. I just hope I can have this forever 
"I was very sensory seeking when I was little, and sometimes when I was in the bathtub; I would get on my arms like I was doing a push up, and then start rocking back and forth, because I liked the way the bumpy texture on the bottom of the shower felt on my skin, and I figured out at some point, that my penis was more sensitive than most of my other parts, so I would sometimes rock back and forth against the floor for the sensory input. It wasn’t sexual because I had no concept of that as a small child, but sometimes my body would react to the stimulation. 

My earliest memory is my of older cousin, who I I later confirmed was 12 at the time, coming in to check on me in the bathtub for some reason, and her catching me doing this when I would have been 4, and her yelling at me when she realized what I was doing. Her yelling scared me, so I got out of the bath and ran crying to my mother, but when I tried to hug her, she saw that I was naked, and that I had an erection from the physical stimuli of the aforementioned sensory seeking behavior. I remember her face turning bright red with anger, as she pushed me away to grab me by my arm with a death grip, and then she spanked me with her other hand until it felt like my whole back was on fire. I remember my cousin crying and begging her to stop, and my mother yelling at her to get out. Once she was finally done spanking me,  she made me stand up and then forced me go stand in the corner with my nose against the wall, still naked, sobbing and covered with my own snot, shaking like crazy from fear and pain. I remember her making me stand there until I was so tired, I physically fell over. Then she spanked me again until I was screaming, and I either passed out or blocked out the rest, because I don’t remember her stopping. The next thing I remember, I was laying face down on her bed, and she sat next to me and put a frozen bag of something on my butt and legs. I remember that she told me that I had been a very bad boy, and that because she loved me so much, she had to punish me to make sure I learned my lesson and didn’t go to hell.

I still to this day, as a now 25 year old man, have an incredibly hard time engaging in any form of sexual intimacy. 

After working with a therapist, I decided to bring up this memory to my mother. When I confronted her, she looked at me like I was crazy, and accused me of making it up, and called me sick, she told it was a perverted fantasy that came only from my brain, and told me to seek help.

I then brought it up a few weeks later with my older cousin.  She confirmed that she remembered it happening, and cried because she felt like she caused it. She was also a child, I never blamed her. 

I have talked to my therapist about it at length, and part of me wants to confront my mother again, with my cousin to back me up. The other part of me knows that it doesn’t matter how much proof I have, she isn’t going to admit it. "
"my mom has been verbally abusive since I was about 7, I'm 15 now and had to grow up way too fast. 

ill start from the beginning, when I was under 10 she would do stuff like yell at me constantly and point out how I was ""fat"" (I was just a slightly chubby kid) and she would always remind me of how she would cry herself to sleep because of me. I never did anything mean to her, I was little and didn't know how to control my emotions so I would often yell back and it would be an argument.

anyways, when I was 8 my mom started doing this thing where she would tell me that she would pack her bags and leave back to Europe by the next morning. that is terrifying to hear at that age because my mom is my primary caregiver, I only see my dad 3 weekends out of the 4 that are in a month. she would tell me that she was abandoning me after any little thing I did, I dropped a mug when putting away dishes and it chipped a little bit and she told me she was gonna leave. 

my mom has also been an alcoholic her whole life, she drank during the pregnancy of her first child (miscarriage) and drank during her pregnancy with me. she is scary when she's drunk, she is 100x more verbally abusive and I sometimes have visions of her hitting me. I don't think she would ever hit me, but I'm not sure. 

she also used to force me to sleep with her. she made me sleep with her until I was like 11 or 12, then she would get mad and start screaming at me and saying how I hate her just because I wanted to sleep in my own bed.

my mom would also always want to see me naked. anytime I would shower from the ages of 9-14 (puberty) she would tell me to get naked infront of her so she could ""inspect if I showered properly"" which would result in her checking everywhere, even my private parts. she still asks me at my age of 15 if she can come help me shower, when I tell her no she always pulls the ""why do you hate me so much?"" card.

the christmas of 2022, I was 13. our tradition is to put up the christmas tree in the morning and then open gifts that night after supper. anyways, after we put the tree up I went and sat down at the kitchen table and picked up my phone to just relax a little bit, my mom walked by and she went on a rant about how I'm always on my phone and then she said something I'll never forget. 

she told me this: ""you are not the daughter I wanted, I wish I never had you"". anytime I bring this up she tells me I'm lying and that she never said it, when I literally have the date written down in my notes of when she said it. 

I know this is long so I'll just list off the other things she does:

she still spanks me in a ""joking"" way, in public, after me asking her and telling her countless times to stop.

she punishes me by not buying me groceries, like if I don't get a chore done before she gets home she'll go ""then I guess you don't get any groceries then"".

I am in the beginning of the process of getting a lawyer and taking my mom to court so I can live with my dad, I'd like some advice and some tips on how to deal with this.

thank you for listening to me."
"I hate my dad and I don't even know where to start on the reasons why. I hate him I hate him I hate him. He is the number one reason to every negative feeling I have and it seems like he can't stand me being happy so he has to ruin it. I financially depend on him because I'm 18 and the minimum wage of my country isn't enough to rent a flat, plus I'm being paid less than minimum wage because no one else wanted to hire an unexperienced transgender teenager so I'm stuck on small gigs that can barely afford my lunch. 

I don't think I can stand being alive in the same world as him. One of us has to die, and if he is not dying, then I will. I will keep trying to kill myself until his death. I'm tired of being alive and wasting my days because he keeps hurting me and the police doesn't do anything because he doesn't hurt physically. Yea sure sure he never beat me, but he insulted me of every word possible, tried to disappear with objects to make me think I'm going crazy, says things and then when I cry about it he says that He didn't said anything and that I'm making things up because I'm an attention seeker. He forces me to do things and then call me ungrateful for not enjoying them. The list goes on and on forever. I will keep trying to die until I either succefully finish it, or until he dies by himself."
"My dad has complete control of the WHOLE family. My family consists of like 7 adults excluding my dad, yet we're powerless against him. We totally rely on him and can't even do anything about his rare anger fits, because he's our only breadwinner. I'm scared of him, my sister is, everyone is.

We're immigrants who still don't have citizenship of the country we're living in, so if we report him, he'll lose his job, and we'll probably go homeless. I don't even want to report him or have him fined or anything like that, I just want psychological power over him. I hate awkwardly giggling when he's speaking, or feeling inferior around him, or feeling like a people pleaser seeking his approval all the damn time. It makes me feel so pathetic and it's humiliating.

He's done so much for us, I can't deny that. But he's emotionally basically non existent. He doesn't care that I don't have friends, he doesn't let me and my sister go out even though we're legal adults in a sage country. Our classmates always go out with their friends and we miss out on so much. All my teenage life passed by just me addicted to my phone because I'm so lonely and alone. I hate being around him, it's so uncomfortably anxiety-causing and I get so on edge and tense.

I don't want to cower before him. I don't want to be afraid. I can't afford therapy. I don't have a job (he doesn't let) I basically can't do anything. He's cheated on my mom and been physically violent with her many times. And I always find myself forgiving him and end up forgetting about how horrible his actions were. He always gossips about people and says extremely inappropriate""jokes"" that leaves the whole family having to fake laughs. It's exhausting.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give advise on how I can be powerful OVER him, and maybe even intimidate him??? Should I tap into my femininity because I heard men are intimidated by this most?? I don't want to cause fights or anything, I just want to detach myself from his control. Any YouTube videos?? Any books?? Any articles, stories, PDFs??? Please!!! I want to be psychologically from this pathetic people pleasing personality."
"I (28F) have a somewhat distant relationship with my parents. I'm trans, live in another city and am polyamorous (which they don't yet know) and undiagnosed but probably autistic (which is its own can of worms). I was recently lectured by my father (49M) about why he's suddenly stopped accepting me as trans again. I came out seven years ago and he initially came around to it, and my mum (47F) remains supportive, just worries about my physical safety.

One of the arguments he tried to make really irked me. He said I now need to detransition *because* he is finding it hard to accept. That when I get into a relationship, it needs to be with a cis woman because that was the idea he's had for me since I was born. My mum wants me to move back to their town because she's struggling with the distance. They said I need to live life for others, and that means that sometimes I need to sacrifice my own happiness. If I do not do these things, this will be seen as a selfish act on my part.

My father has also threatened me with the idea that I'm causing them to want to split up, and that my mum might kill herself if that happens, as she's around menopause age and thus I ""need to be careful with her"". I can thankfully see this for what it is - emotional blackmail. I used to struggle with self-harm and suicidal ideation myself, and I wouldn't even dream of using my mental health as leverage in an argument. Surely my parents' relationship with each other is their responsibility, not mine?

I'm a sensible person. I understand when sacrifices actually *need* to happen. I plan things out and make sure I have a safety net. I am completely independent and stable financially and haven't so much as gone to my parents for advice in about a decade. But the sacrifices they're asking for are *the* things that are making me happy in life. I'd love to be closer to these people, but I feel more hurt every time we meet. I genuinely can't even confidently say I love them any more, I'm just terrified of the fallout they threaten me with.

It's making me miserable honestly. It's been this way for years. *Is* this abuse? How can I communicate to them that I'm my own person and that I can't just throw away my relationships just to make it easier for them to deal with?

TL;DR - Parents want me to make enormous changes to my life because they find it hard to deal with, framing my decisions as selfishness. I want to know whether this is considered abusive and to communicate that I can no longer tolerate this."
"TW: sh, violence, suicide attempt

VERY long vent ahead! 

I've been staying with my mom for the past 3 weeks bc my father got mad when he saw my report card and saw I had Ds bc I literally missed a semester of school due to a suicide attempt because of him! And he threatened to kill me so my mom had to pick me up (thank god she was already there visiting) he gets mad over anything lower than an A, he gets mad about the music I listen to(bc I don't like pop music), I don't dress in all pink like he wants, the fact that I'm bi. He tells me that I have no friends bc I'm a freak who can't be normal if my life depended on it.  My mom has to take me back Sunday bc he'll call the cops and my mom will go to jail (he has custody) I've told counselors and therapists that he's abusive and they tell me I'm a fucking liar. My mom can't afford a judge so that's out. I just don't know what to do. I have PTSD nightmares from him every other night because of him. I really don't wanna go back. I've started cutting to ease the panic attacks and that's the only thing I can do to make it stop. If I make even a tiny mistake, I start shaking and apologising even if it wasn't my fault. I'm not motivated to do anything I used to love bc of him, I stay up all night bc I have nightmares at night and sleep all day and my mom's kinda mad about that. I don't know what to do

I'm crying while typing so I'm not checking for errors, sorry

"Disclaimer I have depression and anxiety that stems from my father’s constant emotional abuse as a child. This is all from my point of view and I really hope it’s not misunderstood I’m not delusional.
So my dad and I have never had the best relationship ever since my parents divorce. He comes from a lot of generational trauma and sometimes that would carry over onto my sisters and I. I always tried to impress him and tried to be the perfect child. I was the like his counsellor as a child his emotional punching bag in a way of words. He’d often tell me that he was more harsh on me since I reminded him of my mom. Eventually as I grew up I couldn’t stand it and slipped deeper into my depression. I ran away from him in a sense I guess sorry don’t want to go into the details. I went to go live with my mom and it was great to be honest. But eventually my mom slipped back into her substance abuse. I retreated back to my dads since I mentally was doing a lot worse. It was fine we fought quite a lot and didn’t get along. But eventually I tried to just keep my opinions to myself. 
 Now back to the main issue. I fought with my dad again he’s always talking about my weight and usually I can ignore it. But I couldn’t this time and snapped. I said a lot of horrible words like swearing off and telling him to go away. But he began to follow me and yell. He had that crazy look in his eye that I’ve always been scared of. And we kept arguing and he started to say that he’ll smash my head into the ground if I don’t stop talking. Saying he picked me up and he can take me out. I was obviously upset and to be honest I wouldn’t put it past him if he did do the things he was threatening me with. Since he has a history of abusing women in the past and with the one off occasion with my step mom. He finally left me and I started crying on the porch. My step brother saw me and I asked for a hug and explained he threatened to hurt me. I later told my sister and she just said she didn’t know what to say. I spent the next couple of days avoiding him because I was scared. I started to plan on how to move out but I’ve never lived somewhere without my parents so I’m terrified. I thought eventually he’d come apologize like he usually does since I thought he went to far but he never did. Until tonight 2 days after the fight. He told me I was mentally deranged and that me going around the house complaining about him was wrong. That everyone thought I was strange and mentally unwell. That what I was doing was wrong.
Am I going insane am I the one in the wrong. 
I’m so scared that he’s right and that my sister hates me. 
I don’t know what to do
If anyone has any advice or can put their two cents in I’d greatly appreciate it.
I can’t go to my sister anymore since I have reason to believe she is fed up with me. 
Thank you for reading. "
"Hi. My (f17) boyfriend (M17) is allowing me to make this post in search of advice on what to do/legal advice because his parents are forcing him to play soccer.

My boyfriend has been playing soccer since he was about 3 or 4 and has been in both club and school teams for his entire life. He used to enjoy the sport, but even in the beginning, his father would berate him, force him to practice for 2+ hours in the morning and then 2+ hours at night. His father had also physically and verbally abused him when my boyfriend was 2 or 3 and the physical abuse stopped a little before the age of 8. All of the subsequent emotional and verbal abuse since then has been to call my boyfriend a failure, an underachiever, a loser, etc, even though he is one of the top players on his club team. But, even if he were one of the worst, it’s still no excuse. 

In the past year, my boyfriend has suffered two major injuries, an almost completely torn through ligament in his leg, and a torn shoulder ligament, both of which required massive surgeries with the longest healing time lasting 9 months and weeks upon weeks of physical therapy. Despite this factor, and a major depressive episode lasting months, my boyfriends father forces him to practice soccer for 2 hours in the morning most days and sometimes still 2 more hours at night, despite some residual pain in his knee and shoulder. This is taking a large mental health toll on my boyfriend and he is visiting with a psychiatrist at least once a week for therapy appointments. 

Recently, he has expressed to his parents that he wishes to quit soccer and desires to do things he actually likes. My boyfriend has expressed to me that he believes he may have actually liked soccer if his father hadn’t completely sucked the joy out of the sport. Despite this request to quit soccer, his parents are continually forcing him to go to soccer college camps and compete in them. This is making him depressed and anxious. They complied for maybe a week before just yesterday, manipulating him into saying yes. His mother said he was selfish and a failure, and that he is throwing away his natural talent. They continue to taunt him and use me as a reason he is “weak minded” and a failure, which is not true as a i would support him whether he wanted to play soccer or not. Oh, and I forgot to mention, they complied until the very night before he would have to leave for a two day long camp that is three states away. He officially left about 3 or 4 hours ago. Because of my boyfriend’s mental health he has gotten resources from a mental health hospital, but has never had to have had a visit there (no shame if he did anyways). But, his mother has coerced him  into going to the soccer camp by threatening that she would send him to inpatient for five days. my boyfriend did not threaten self harm or suicide or anything that he would have to be sent away for, she simply threatened it unprovoked because he didn’t want to play soccer. 

He is constantly being taunted by his father about soccer, and his mother, who is not innocent, is complacent in everything and is allowing him to be abused in this manner. she has told him from when he was little to hide the bruises his father gave him and has never really offered him a true feeling of safety with her. Even though she never laid a hand on him, I believe her actions are deplorable and her and his father need to be held accountable.

The thing is though, CPS already knows about the abuse he endured as a child, but is there something he can do about the threatening to send him to a mental hospital if he doesn’t play soccer, and would that be through CPS if need be? 

I feel like this situation is very specific and I’m trying to google how to do this, but I feel like it might be good to find help from people who have maybe gone through something similar. I also believe the forcing him to do a physical sport is a form of physical abuse and has to be acknowledged. This has been going on for as long as he can remember and I’ve been dealing with this with him since three years ago when we started dating. I’d also like to state that the verbal and emotional abuse doesn’t just start and end with soccer, but applies to every other corner of his life. What can I do to help him and what can he do to help himself? Legal OR General advice appreciated

I want to be get adted little helping hand 
"Hi so im new on this app and I installed it since i knew theres a lot of people who may be in my situation. My mom is abusive, she is beating me daily for no reason and thinks i own her everything, she also tells me daily how i should kym and she wishes she never had me, even if i got used to it i still get hurt by her words. She loves to make fun of me, calling me names, i have bpd and she makes so many jokes abt it by calling me crazy and how she wish i would get killed some day. Sometimes when she sees me happy she makes fun of my smile, or find a reason to punish me. Im tired of living this way, im poor, i have no one to talk to abt this or to help me, my mom even lie to everyone that she loves me and we have a very close bonding just so she can keep a good reputation. I don’t know what to do, i can’t call any kind of child service since in my country abusing ur kid is normal and nobody really cares. I need help, im 16 and i’ve been thinking about running away but im sure i wont make it or i wont be safe by myself. (ik sorry for my bad english, english is not my first language)

"My mom has always been good to me, she never hurt me, but she’s always been a little strange. As a kid, I had the normal weird humor of any kid, and my mom would joke like that, etc. but now I’m genuinely bothered by what happened. 

So I’m at my aunts new apartment to shower because my hot water heater broke and we are looking for someone to install the new one, and I’m sitting down in a chair playing on my phone, and then my mom just walked over, and sat on my lap. Now something to know is that I’ve dealt with sexual assault in the past, so I’m very uncomfortable with some physical touch, and stuff like that, and she even told me she’d stop her normal “jokes” (playfully “spanking” me ever so often) but hasn’t. Anyways I told her “Dude, it’s way too hot for this.” And she just laughed, I almost slipped and said “Dude it’s way to fucking hot get off.” But I didn’t, anyways she wouldn’t get up until I finally said fuck it and just shoved her off. I don’t know if it’s just normal teasing or not, but it’s been bothering the hell out of me. Plus (just me being paranoid I’m sure) anytime I date a girl, my mom will ALWAYS find something to judge them by. “Oh she seems like she’s trying to hurt you” and “oh you haven’t even met her how do you know she isn’t bad” etc. she always finds the slightest detail and tries to pry us apart.

Another thing is she often touches me somewhat inappropriately. (Excuse my language but it otherwise sounds childish) she will randomly slap or pinch my ass, and I’ve told her to cut the shit, she said she would, she doesn’t. I have had to slap the back of her hand away because she would keep doing it, and it’s not bothering me. A lot. "
"there is no physical abuse but my mother is being a real control freak, threatening my sis (10F) with religion (everything she does is based on religion, corrupting my sisters view on reality and life), other kinds of psychological abuse (for example, she just shouted at my sister “shes useless” because she didnt want to read a religious book, this happens all the time) always shouting and she has literally turned my sister into a monster too, they always scream at each other, always because mom tries to control everything about my sis. she is the reason my sister is behind with everything compared to her peers, socially and academically. she still acts like a 6 year old. (because she is being treated like a 6 year old) she doesnt even want to let my sister go to school (not because she wants to homeschool her, because she doesnt think it should happen, she would rather raised my sis closed up in the house, become a saint or whatever) its like those cult movies you see. 

she (sis) never gets acknowledged, respected, listened to. and even when she does she is bombarded with “god, god, afterlife, sins, devil, god” im scared she will grow to be obsessive, paranoid, anxious and ostracized by others. she is already showing signs, scared that god will punish her with every wrong thing she does, shes anxious and paranoid. she always has stomach aches, never eats, shes so thin and weak. also bullied at school, she can never fit in, and this is moms fault. (i know what its like not to fit in, but in this case its mostly my moms fault to turn my sis into this person she is, its like a mini version of her) the bad part about this is she still is by moms side, mom has brainwashed her. she slowly starts to rebel by not wanting to read the books but shes still by moms side a lot, thats all shes known her entire life. 


i really want to get her out of this, but theres nothing i can do. (im 18F and we live the 3 of us) dads kind of out of the picture, i mean not really but mom and dad are already separated, almost for this exact reason. dad cant be an option to take us in, i wouldnt want that either. all my moms side of the family could do is maybe talk to her but they would probably support my mom, even if they didnt theres nothing they can do. but theyre still all better thsn her. 

idk thats it ig i just want her to grow to be a healthy individual"
my mom keeps touching me inappropriately and when i confront her about it she just laughs and tells me to not take it personally. i dont know what to do i feel like sh\*t and i feel like its all my fault or idk but she taught me to always take the blame and suck it up even when i was not at fault. now everything i do i cant go without feeling bad because i made another mistake i dont even know anymore my life is fu\*\*ed
"my mom and sister work at the same company so shes controlling abt what time she wakes up and goes home bcus she basically drives her and her own sister (who also works at the same company) to work. my sister wasnt waking up on time so she kept yelling abt it and when it was 15 past the time she said “wake up i need to go to work and earn a living! if u dont want to then dont drag me down with you! i need to earn a living bcus i have responsibilities not like you BOTH who sleep all day and dont do anything and just think of yourself! selfish!” even tho she told me before that i dont have to look for a job so soon. i left my job in January due to my own stuff, and basically due to burn out and probably mental illness ive been asleep almost 80% of the time. recently ive got back into gyming but damn ykno. my moms sister is also a bitch bcus she always excuses my mom’s behaviour by saying shes the way she is bcus of my father. well hes dead now, so what now yknow? also just bcus my dad is financially irresponsible doesnt mean she can just be a bitch to us and lash out at us all the time. my mom also excuses HERSELF by saying that “well im just mad i just say things and dont mean it” but takes every rejection from me or my sister very very personal. it sucks living with her and i hate her. it feels so alone when i think about it bcus for so long in my life my sister never really took my side when i would talk about her abuse. and even now i feel bad for calling it abuse bcus i feel like it isnt so bad but everytime she reminds me why i feel this way and why i cant say anything to her abt anything. god im so sorry i just feel so tired"
I know it's kinda selfish but I've gone through this crap for 5 years and I'm so sick of it she's angered easily but a few minutes later will be totally fine she gets upset at simple mistakes I understand she has a lot of pressure on her shoulders but her outburst get more and more disturbing leading to outcomes worthy of a call or two to CPS she acts like a child getting upset when things aren't the way she thinks they should be I hate how she pushes this narrative that family should always come first which is good logic but not in this case) I lost love for her a long time ago so much so that I'm unable to feel actual affection towards her she's very racist (but she doesn't see it that way) and VERY homophobic again she doesn't think that but when my brother came out as gay she started talking crap she also pushes everyone away then says everyone is fake and put to get her I can't wait til I can move out  and dump her into a retirement home and let her rot for the rest of her days
"So trigger warning talks about physical abuse. 

I grew up in a brown household, and am the first/only daughter. My mother was emotionally blackmailed into marrying my father, by her parents, and I've known this since I was a child. They had me a year into their marriage, and I've always known that she never really wanted to marry him.

Now, I understand what happened to her was wrong, except she's chill with her family, and has physically and mentally abused, me and my siblings all of our lives.

My father has also been physically abusive occasionally and gaslights manipulates us. But I know that he truly loves me and would do anything for me. Except I can't trust men. My maternal grandfather, passed away before my mother's wedding but he was the one who had initially started with the blackmailing, because ""he had given her everything she wanted her entire life, and in return she should listen to him."" She doesn't think he was in the wrong, and that he was caring. I hate him because I could never imagine taking my child's rights to decide for themselves. Everyone around me constantly praises him and I hate it.

I've never been able to truly trust my father because of this and have grown into a very defensive person. I don't like people taking control of my life, so growing up I would constantly try to draw a boundary. 

Growing up I never saw a healthy loving relationship between my parents. In fact I was the one who had mediate their fights. I would standup for my mother, whereas her only family members would make fun of how they forced her. But in the end they were the ones she loves. It infuriates me, because I consider them traitors. I can't be nice to them because im always reminded of their shitty behavior, especialy since they still make insensitive jokes, and never take blame. Even though they do send me gifts and try to be affectionate, I can't show affection to them. 

Now I'm at a point where I've started financially earning but I can't move out because I have to pay for my university, and it's against our culture( I live in an Asian country), and tbh I'm not making enough. 

I'm trying to change and get rid of the toxic traits that I have in me. 
I'm very loud because I've always had to scream just to be heard. And I wanna get rid of this. And I curse a lot but I've realised it's because my mother used to curse a lot. 

And Ive never been in any romantic relationships, not even close. Because I've completely closed myself off. I'm very emotional when it comes to my friends but I'm scared that I can't open up like that or my partner will use it against me. 

It's like even if I get out of this house, the effects will always stay there. Everytime I start a new relationship, what my parents did to me will stop it from evolving into anything good. 

It took a long time for me to emotionally open up to friends but even now I get scared that I'm a nuisance to them. 

And my parents keep gaslighting me and telling me that they've never abused me. It took me ages to get rid of the shame. I felt as though I was in the wrong and that it was embarrassing to have parents who abuse me. 

It's so scary because they say that they did it with good intentions but they can't see that it ruined me. I feel so broken and I don't know. I just need to know that there's hope, and that someone out there has survived and learnt and actually become a new person. "
"hey, this will be my first and probably only post on reddit. i just needed somewhere to get it out of my mind and off my chest. both of my parents suck and i don't have somewhere else to go. 

my biological father is a monster. he's diagnosed with schizophrenia and dependent personality disorder. he's not a monster because of these diagnoses. he's had many wrongs in his lifetime and a lot of trauma. i did not know about the schizophrenia diagnosis until just this week - when his ex gf reached out to me to discuss. (she was worried and wanted to let me know if i had 't been aware and offer resources with the journey.) 

his mother, my grandmother, is a hoarder. her house can't be lived in and has been unsafe since i visited for the summer in the 2010s. she and my father are horrifically codependent. the doctors had to tell her that my father is a grown man and can take carw of himself at the hospital. 

she's outright a narcissist. i recall multiple instances where she's going off on my disabled brother for not doing everything to her standards and i jump in to defend him.

i had to write a handwritten apology because this 70 fucking year old woman got so asshurt that a 16 year old told her to back the fuck off that she stopped showing up to bring food for a MONTH. she verbally berates everyone. i've had to apologize in public when she goes off on racist rants and, in one specific instance, i had to call insurance when she keyed another family's car when i was 12. 

i've cut all contact with her. she's the first person i've ever had to do that with. she ran the house like it was the military. 

my father is comparatively nicer. he has moments where it feels lucid, like he's an actual person with feelings but that's only 30% of the time. i have vivid memories of chatting with him happily before doing homework and then getting verbally berated only minutes later because i wasn't following his directions to an exact. 

my earliest childhood memory of him was an argument about table manners (my brother did not like to bring the fork to his face, instead he leaned down to eat.) and it into him hitting my 14 y/o brother and shoving him into the closet door. i was too young to process it happening to the degree i know it now, just that it felt deeply wrong to witness and something about it was innately backwards. 

i got diagnosed with adhd when i was very young, in first grade actually. and when my mother told him about the medication i would need to be on, he pulled over and walked out of the car yelling that he would never have a kid ""with (r slur here) issues"". he's always spoken to me like i'm deficient. it's always felt like i had to do something to earn praise from him. 

currently i am in my 20s and out of a job. i planned to be in college at this point in my life, but i can't afford it because the early savings account that we as a family set up, got drained for his goddamn mother to fill her house with more useless clothes. 

the parents i live with (my mother and stepfather) yell at me constantly about getting a job but i keep failing interviews and i don't have enough experience in the field i want to work in, because of aforementioned college fund disappearing 'magically'. they charge me ridiculous rent that by now has ""been piling up."" despite my mother previously promising that she would never do that. they will not listen to me when i try to explain that it feels like i'm just now trying to do the whole growing process again. 

my stepfather has been trying to step in as a father figure. which i appreciate, i think. families are going to be difficult, even in healthy non-abusive ones. but he's oscillating between threatening to kick me out if i don't get a job in the next few months and saying it's out of love. i don't know how to feel about it without outright having a panic attack. i think i'm just far too gone to have a proper parental figure suddenly try to introduce themselves and be a part of my life. 

my mother is bordering alcoholism, i think. it's a hereditary thing in the family and my grandfather on her side started this pattern similarly. a month ago i had to stay up until 2am to make sure she got home safe after repeated nights out of drinking and getting high with her friends. 

she's easily impressionable, and fell into a bunch of racist conspiracies and homophobia during the 2020 lockdown. she's a bisexual woman, i am a nonbinary lesbian. i don't understand how it happened. she makes me feel lost. it beats the hell that my biological father has raised though, don't get me wrong. 

- heres the catch, i have further job opportunities in the city my biological father lives in, but i can't live with him under any circumstances. he's had psychotic episodes as recently as 2022 despite his treatment for it. 

i just feel defeated and hollow. it gets better, i know it does. i just never knew just how bad everything i didn't know prior to this… discovery was. i loved my father and wanted to move in before knowing this. 

im at the point where my brothers and my dog and the potential of things suddenly turning around is the only thing keeping me going. if i didn't have my dog i don't know what i would do. 

i would like to forgive my parents as long as everything changes but i currently have no faith in it. i just don't know what it's like having a loving family. 

thank you dad, you ruined my fucking life before it even got a chance to start. thank you mom, for repeatedly acknowledging issues but not solving them. "
I 25 fm just got disciplined like I was 10 my dad got upset because my brother was talking with a slightly raised voice and came out into our living room and started lashing out on us he hit me in the face and scolded me and I fell and then threatened to punch my brother?? No one said or did anything to antagonize him he just got extremely irate and yesterday he threw his office chair across his office and almost broke it in half and the night before that he snapped his controller in half out of pure rage I’m absolutely terrified of him and how aggressive he is I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him and it’s genuinely sad he never got caught treating his whole family like this for as long as he’s had us 
"I (19 F) am home for the summer from my freshman year of college. My parents are not very good at maintaining my privacy, and especially like to come into my room unannounced or without asking. For the past serveral years, my father almost only ever talks to me when it is to tell me to clean the house, do schoolwork, or something church related (they are active mormons, I don't believe but have to pretend I do to keep them happy). Today is my mom's birthday. Several times this summer, my father will tell my mother that (me) and him will do the dishes and clean up after dinner because she worked so hard on cooking. It really bugs me when he volunteers me to do work. I don't mind cleaning up, but I really value my automomy and he rarely ever actually helps too. He did so today, and I admittedly made a face when he said he and I would clean up after dinner. He proceeded to get really offended, and get really upset that I wasn't willing to ""even do this one thing on my mother's birthday"". I've tried talking to him before about how I feel his love is conditional to how much work I do for him, and he laughed. He said I didn't mean it and I knew he loved me. But he only talks to me to tell me to work, and it's been going on for years. The problem really isn't the cleaning. It's that every time I bring up how he talks to me solely about things I need to do for him, he gets mad and defensive. He often also starts listing all the ways he financially supports me, which makes me feel guilty. I always end up apologizing, feeling like I'm in the wrong and entitled, and wishing I had just kept my head down and done the work without comment. Am I entitled, is he just bad at parenting, or is this emotionally abusive??? I really can't tell if I'm in the wrong for being so hurt about this. "
"My parents don’t think I’m capable of raising my children on my own. I’m deaf and have chronic illnesses, yes, but I also have a supportive partner. We’re engaged. My partner is capable of supporting us and is fine with renting a place where my kids can live under our roof. He has taken my kids out to do stuff when I can’t, like ice skating, driving them around, etc. However my parents are forcing me to stay here in their house. The irony of the situation is that my ex is trying, for the same reasons, to force the kids to move back in with him, and they don’t want to. I have told the kids repeatedly that I will respect their wishes in this matter. If they preferred to be at their dad’s I would support their decision; if they prefer to stay with my parents I’m fine with that too (although we would still rent a place with space for them, so they could come and go as they pleased.) But my parents are saying that 1. I’m not a good parent 2. I’m not capable of parenting on my own (although I wouldn’t BE on my own! When I am feeling unwell my partner would step up, and if they were under my roof I would of course push myself to play an active role.) I am very depressed living here. I hole up in my bedroom, which is the same thing my middle child does at her dad’s, for the same reason. It’s not that I don’t get along with my parents, it’s that they constantly treat me like a child and then complain when I act like one. For the record, I have tried very hard to be more of an adult around them, but living under their roof causes me to fall back into toxic behavior patterns. My body reacts to the stress, so I’m in pain a lot. And my mental health is suffering. I was trying to endure it because I thought that when the school year began, my partner and I would live together in a place of our own. So while I was never *happy,* exactly, I was trying to maintain a facade of normality. Now they are telling me that I must only *visit* my partner but remain here. They keep saying that it’s for the sake of the kids, but I am not doing well here and once they said that I immediately lost all motivation to even attempt to be stable. I’m severely depressed and having trouble taking care of myself. I know things would not be like this with my partner because we’ve had long periods of co-habitation and I was much more functional, despite various health issues that have cropped up recently. I was motivated to get out of bed and take care of myself. Now that is gone. I don’t understand how they can possibly think this is good for the children? I will never be physically well 100%, but when you add severe depression into the mix, the result is very bad. How can I get them to understand that I want to be free? I don’t think I will live to be old, and I want at least a few years of living apart from them. They don’t seem to understand that this is driving a wedge between us, and that when the kids have graduated I intend to move to Alaska full time and go low-contact as a result of this. It feels like a prison. A nice one, yes, but there’s a poisonous lack of freedom that is causing me to suffer."
"I am a 15 F and I have no longer the joy to live
I have abusive parents and I don't know if I should endure it till I become 18 or run away.

To give you and example when I was 5 two boys almost the same age took my toy and mocked me, like any kid I went complain to my dad and he said ""grow up I haven't time for this"" in an anoyed way. I insisted cuz it was my fav toy and he got mad and yeeted me back to the sandbox hurting my back.

When I was 7 I received a fake bird that could fly. I asked my parents if when can we go outside so I can play with it, they said later and i agreed. I waited and days later I asked again, my mom snapped with anger for an unknown reason and said ""break that shit it's getting on my nerve!"" My dad, her slave as always, did it and I was holding my tears up so that my sis doesn't see me crying (she was 4.)

But the worst was at 10.
We were in Morocco to visit family and me and my cousin 13 where alone with my uncle and he brought us to a strip club? And the owner looked at us with a disturbing grin and he and my uncle talked. He payed my uncle and my uncle said to us go to the room 3 and wait I will get drink.
Spoiler alert drinks never came but other things yes.
A guy came in and he started looking at my cousin (forgot to tell my uncle had told us to only wear shorts and tight shirts). He started to approach my cousin and touched her in inappropriate ways. my blood was boiling cuz she was the only one nice to me. When he tossed her shorts off while her screaming to not and trying to fight back something snapped in me. I remembered my multi gadget had a knife and before I know it he had three holes in the chest and my knife was dirty with this man blood. I was panicking but hopefully my cousin made us leave by the emergency exit. That wasn't even the last straw, my uncle is a pedo and he tried to grop us countless times but every fucking time I complained my parents says. ""You are probably miss interpreted him  that how he show love!""or ""he's family and it's your fault cover up"". He even kiss me in the lips multiple times now what doi say to my futer kids? ""oh yeah my first kiss was taken by my uncle!"".
I feel like throwing up remembering this and knowing i have no power against it.

Today my parents made us change country again without telling us so no goodbyes to my friends or having a last hang out. No. For the 3th time.

It's been a year since I am in this country but they want to change again and that would mess up my studies cuz not all countries have the same education system and diploma.
They even make all the chores on me:
Cleaning 
Cooking even the lunchboxes for my parents (not that it bothers me but they only call me names not even thanks or a smile)
Babysitting my siblings in summer so almost no time to go out except after 5 pm and for a good reason.
Therapist and even if i A.L.W.A.Y.S. Talk calmy and nicely they find a reason to snap
Have to be perfect (grades,personalities,have a good knowledge and etc so they can flex)
Bank (they take my allowance or money from my part-time job)

My siblings literally come to me first cuz I am the responsible.
To the point that I don't even see my siblings as siblings but as my kids.

They always argue honestly I hoped they never Married. They always call me names never my name to the point that if you call me by my name I will get weird out.

The only thing stopping me from running away are my siblings.

But should I? Or wait till I became 18 or end it all ?

basically what the top says. 
"Father is quite abusive, growing up in an Indian household, I'm always scared of him, giving up everything I liked through my life, he forces me to read management and misbehaved with my friends and my cousins, he always yells at me and makes me feel uncomfortable claiming I should beg and not study, he stopped me from going to another country and I'm 20, depressed, frustrated, emotionless and made my mind, seeing so many toxic and abusive husbands, fathers, mothers and families, i will be friendless, single and childfree for the rest of my life. 


I'll be there at my dad's Birthday and other functions but I'm going no contact later onwards and I'll be away from everyone, I need some help in how i can be a bit better at avoiding abuse. "
"I am 15f and have immigrant parents who are 42f and 42m, throughout my childhood my mom has been a constant source of hate and anger but I am writing this post because I genuinely do not know if this counts as abuse especially since we are brown and so a lot of this behavior is common in brown households. So I'm gonna give a little insight on some things my mom has done to me while I was under the age of 10 although I don't remember around 85-90% of the things shes done to me while she somehow remebrs every bad thing I've done. So in elementary she took acedmics very seriously and every single day she would make me do extra practice work that would take hours to do and would be above my grade level. Many many times while doing above grade level ixl with her if I got a question wrong she would take the iPad I was doing it on and hit me repatidly with it on my head, also she would scream and scream till I was crying if I made any mistakes. One time when I was around 7 so in first grade I got a question wrong and she took a pencil and stabbed my arm with it which made my arm start bleeding. Also several times if I did something wrong she would grab me by my hair and would drag me across the floor just by my hair which was incredibly painful and scary. Also when I was around 2nd grade she would take a cooking tool similar to a wooden rolling pin and would hit me with it which hurts like hell because its huge and wooden. Throught my childhood if I did anything wrong she would hit me and I would actually be happy if she used her shoes to hit me because they didn't hurt as much. Also a few times she got so angry that she grabbed onto my arms and clawed at me to the point where my arms were bleeding. Theese are just a few creative methods shes used to hit my but often she would just slap me, despite all this what she did to me phycally wasn't nearly as bad as mentally. So ever since I was a little kid my mom can not speak to me or treat me like a normal human being let alone her daughter, whenever I ask her a simple question she snaps at me and never speaks in a normal tone. This obviously makes me reluctant to talk to her and when I still do our conversations always end in agrumnets. She is extremely easy to upset and when she does get angry she spends hours whispering to her self while cooking or upstairs about all the horrible things she wishes would happen to me or my family. I can not recall everything she says and she speaks in our native language so its difficult to translate but she usually says something along the lines of how much she wishes we were dead, all the truly disgusting and sinister ways she would kill us for emapmple my stomping my head in or kicking and rolling me around and spitting on me or murdering me or kicking me out of the house to live with street dogs. All the examples I've just given are extremely tame versions of what she says, her whisperings are very graphic and detailed and they make my stomach turn I don't understand how someone can whish such disgusting horrific things on their own children when most people wouldn't wish it on there worst enemy. Her whispering that she does is still pretty loud so everyone can hear her and its basically her trying to curse us or wish for the worst most gruesome violent things to happen to us. She does this several times a day and does this for very very small things. Theres a lot more insane things shes done this is the tip of the ice berg. "
"So, my mom and her boyfriend have been together for about 10 years now and for all ten years they've argued with each other, usually it's just an argument about something stupid and nine times out of ten my mom's boyfriend is the one to start the argument. My mom is a very calm and peaceful person who hates confrontation, so she usually tries to walk away from the argument but that only pisses off her boyfriend, sometimes to the point where he hits her or puts his hands around her neck. Now my mom wants to move on and he refuses to leave. Literally just ten minutes before typing this we nearly had to call the police on him because he kept grabbing her by the arms and not letting her leave the situation and he also put his hands around her neck again. My mom isn't the only one he has put his hands on though, he has tried to choke me and he has hit my brother. I don't hate the guy but he needs mental help, for whatever reason he doesn't see any of this as wrong. There have been nice times with him but for the most part I've been stressed out over these past ten years. I'm 25 and I don't have the money to move out, all I  want is some sense of peace for a bit, I've spent a large chunk of my childhood stressed out and scared."
"So the police found out about my dad and the thing is it isnt that bad, but the court case cost around 5k and we don't have that money. I wanna go surfing but I had to sell my surfboard to give my dad the money to go. Even though he is an abuser he still is my dad and I'm scared. He blames me for everything."
"So I do want to get too into it because the story with my mother is decades long but curious about an outside perspective on my relationship with her. 

Currently my mother is homeless/on the verge of homeless. It's been like this for the past 3 years. She's made no effort in the past 15+ years to get a long term stable job and unfortunately has just squandered away and money she comes across to afford any kind of living situation. However with no job this money goes by quick. We seem to be on an every 6months cycle where she texts me asking for more money because she is again about to be homeless (this has happened at least 10+ times in the past 3 years). 

She claims her various illnesses are what is preventing her from finding a job. Yet she doesn't take care of herself and is letting these health issues be an excuse for why everything in her life is going wrong and not her fault. 

Yesterday I get news that our families dog who unfortunately has been with her in these tumultuous times needed to be put down (she was 7 years old black lab). She got sick out of the blue and I believe this to be a lack of care from my mother to our dog. I just finished college hence why I have not been taking care of the family dog. I also suggested that although painful to give up this animal it would be best for her to have a family that could properly take care of her. 

Regardless because of a lack of funds on her end, I just paid 800$ for all the blood work the did on the dog and her euthenization. Im glad our dog is not in pain anymore but extremely distraught that this situation even had to happen.

She is again after this just happening yesterday asking me for 300$ to pay for her hotel shes been staying at. I just can't keep throwing money at her knowing it will never come back. I am currently supporting myself and my younger brother as well. 

I always feel guilty for saying no to her but after years of this and an unstable childhood  I just can't do it anymore. I guess curious if anyone has dealt with a parent like this and what they did to cope? 

TLDR: My mother has been homeless for 3 years, constantly asks me for money to avoid eviction. She blames health issues for not working but neglects her own care. Recently had to put down our dog due to her negligence, costing me $800. Now she wants $300 for a hotel. I'm supporting myself and my brother and can't keep funding her irresponsibility. Wondering how others cope with similar situations.

"


 
this is gonna need some background information, so i'm sorry the post is so long.


my (20F) boyfriend (22M) and his sister (24F) grew up in a dysfunctional family, in which they were fed and given shelter but neglected in terms of: 
- emotional neglect (exposed to parents arguments and personal issues, no family time, ignoring mental health)
- educational neglect (allowed him to drop out of school, made no efforts to encourage study)
- environmental neglect (unsanitary surroundings and food handling, holes in floors and walls not being fixed, not being fed a balanced or healthy diet)
- not having a hygienic environment 
- not taught or encouraged to get a job or higher education, how to write a resume, essentially most basic skills parents would teach their teens/young adults 
- losing/not giving him his important documents like birth certificate that he needed in order to get a provisional license, passport, etc

as well as neglect, his father is frequently in and out of a job due to him not showing up and so they have him and his sister give them money to buy large amounts of cigarettes (they struggle financially already, and his sister is also in debt due to this). 
My boyfriend is also diagnosed with ASD, which impacts his ability to get hired (discrimination, sensory and social issues).

As a result of all this he and his sister are reliant on staying with their parents and are not yet able to move out. 
this has created a very depressing, solitary environment for my boyfriend as often nobody is awake in the daytime, they do not interact unless to ask for money or dump their emotional load onto him, and he is held back from pursuing a happy and fulfilled adult life. 

Onto what the title says, their mother (F60) is diagnosed with schizophrenia, which can largely influence her behaviour. 
She regularly refuses to take her medication, and as a result will act aggressively, say harmful things, make unwise financial decisions, and they don't know what they can actually do as she is an adult, and when they have had to dial 999 did not receive adequate help.

as their father refuses to step up, my boyfriend and his sister take the brunt of this and have to regularly walk on eggshells and act as her caretakers. 

my boyfriend is afraid of leaving home for too long as she has expressed suicidal intent before, made threats, and he feels personally responsible for her. 

he isn't sure if he can contact social services or if anything exists that would help him to develop skills and find work/become self-sustaining as an autistic adult, which 
drives him to feeling hopeless and at times suicidal.

I wanted to ask the *adult adults* of reddit, what can he and his sister actually do in this situation to become independent? are there resources available in the UK for this niche situation? 

it pains me seeing him so hopeless, he is an incredibly intelligent, selfless, and capable person who deserves to begin his own life and thrive.


tl;dr:
my boyfriend and his sister were neglected and abused growing up, and are struggling to move out for a multitude of reasons (boyfriend struggles with autism, sister in debt because of parents, feeling responsible for mother's mental health and providing for their parents). as adults, what services or support is available to help my boyfriend and his sister become independent and break free from this toxic household?

"i 19f am living at home with my parents 51m and 43f. when i was younger they were extremely physically and mentally abusive. my dad once threw me into a windowsill and knocked me out for being too loud while my friend was over. my mom called me a slut and said i looked terrible when my friend did my makeup. they say i did not experience a difficult childhood even though we were dirt poor and i’ve been abused my whole life. now, for the most part, the physical abuse has stopped beyond certain occasions, but now they are set to ruin my life. i want to go to college to become a vet, but they are keeping me trapped here. i got into SIU carbondale, paid for housing, registered for classes, put in my notice at work, everything. all i asked them to do was fill out the FAFSA so i could get a loan. this caused them to take my car to the junkyard, refuse to sign anything, and scream at me for hours. i have done everything i can. i tried to get a private loan but was denied because i don’t have a cosigner (i will never find one) i cannot get federal aid without them signing a FAFSA refusal letter, and i have no way to pay out of pocket. i told them i will commit suicide if they don’t do this for me and they laughed in my face. they do not care about me, they just want to leech off of me forever. i’m out of options. they have beat me. i am seriously considering suicide now, because if i can’t build a future for myself, what’s the point? i said this to my dad, and he agreed i should do it. i cant run away i have nowhere to go, ive tried everything to get a loan, its impossible. if you have any advice, please, let me know, i could use anything.

TW: I talk about suicide and self harm.

PS: I don’t think my parents are abusive, but I thought it somewhat fit the subject.

Something I just realized is that I think my parents have really messed me up. To the point that I don’t know what to expect from people anymore. I don’t know how to expect being treated and I feel like I can’t expect that people are there for me, because everyone I have ever talked to about the stuff my parents did to me have just said that humans can’t be/aren’t perfect.

I was struggling with intrusive thoughts about killing my little sister (I have severe OCD).  I had struggled every day, every single second for a year. I stopped liking what I used to like, like dancing and I struggled to the point where I couldn’t even take care of myself and do basic stuff like shower. I walked upstairs to my mom while crying, then I asked her to talk to me and come downstairs, which I only agreed to after my dad persuaded me to talk to her. We got downstairs and she looked at me with a cold face as I sat there crying and sobbing from being terrified and exhausted, and she told me “why don’t you just do it then?”

When I finally tried to kill myself my dad told me that she had said that she felt nothing (my dad didn’t mean it as a bad thing, he thought it was because she was just tired, so he said it to me because he thought it’d show that she really did love me).

On the night that I killed myself my mom and dad left me alone at the hospital. I was laying there, alone, devastated and sobbing in the dark for the entire night. The one time that night when I tried to call my parents, they both got mad because they wanted to sleep and then they hung up.

I once asked my mom if she loved me. Because I wasn’t sure if she did anymore, she said “yes.” but based off of her emotionless tone, that was a lie. She also didn’t say anything more. Just that simple word. Yes.. I know my mom. When she did love me, when I was younger, she would’ve gotten sad that I believed she didn’t, but now, all I was met with was an emotionless voice saying the word yes mechanically.

When I had tried to kill myself a second time, by cutting, I eventually gave up and called my dad as I had to get to the doctor to possibly get stitched up, and after I had explained the situation to him all he did was complain that he had to drive me to the doctor and so I had to take the bus (which is okay, I’m just sad that he didn’t care at all).

When my mom later saw that I had cut myself, she didn’t react at all. She was still as happy and just kept talking like it didn’t matter at all.

One time my dad and I talked and he said that if I ever died he doesn’t know if he’d cry (he has this thing where he doesn’t think he’s generally able to cry though).

The things my parents have done to me, and the fact that they weren’t there for me when I needed them the most, has created an emotional wound in me that I will have to carry for the rest of my life.

I look back at the pictures of me and my parents from when I was a kid. And even though they are alive, it feels like I have lost them. Like they are gone.

My mom and my dad, who I felt safe with. Who said that they’d always love me and that nothing I could do would ever change that. They aren’t here anymore.

And if it could even get any worse, I now also don’t know what to expect from people. When I was only 16 and needed my parents, the two people who were supposed to protect me. When I was so mentally unwell and so devastated, exhausted, sad and in need of support and help. They weren’t there. Instead, they started doing and saying some of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me.

And everyone I’ve ever told about these things always tells me “well your parents probably does love you” and that humans are not perfect.

I just read somewhere about a girl who had had a really bad day as she struggled with her mental health. She had talked to her boyfriend about thoughts she was having about self harm and that she was really struggling. Later that day when they went to bed he asked to have sex with her. She wasn’t in the mood at all, but said yes. While they were having sex she suddenly started bleeding from her nose. He told her that he could just “throw a towel over it and then she could finish off”. She said that she wasn’t in the mood anymore and started crying as she had had a really bad day and were struggling. And she was sitting there explaining to him that she wasn’t in the mood much in the first place, but as she’s talking to him he stops her mid sentence and tells her that she put him in a weird position here because he needed to jack off to be able to sleep. Then he pulled up his phone to watch porn and jack off next to his crying, bleeding girlfriend. To all of this I thought: “well, I feel bad for her, that was not an ideal reaction from him, but humans aren’t perfect.”. That was my reaction. It wasn’t until after I started reading what others had to say about it that I started realizing how bad he was really treating her and that it wasn’t okay.

Now I am genuinely concerned about myself. On top of the fact that I have lost my parents and that my mom doesn’t love me anymore, all of this also seems to have affected me in the way that I don’t know what is normal and what is not. I don’t know what to expect from people, or how I should expect that they treat me. How can I know when someone is going too far and treating me badly? How can I know what is okay and what is not? 

Even when I read about what I’ve written here and about the things my parents have said and done. I don’t know if I am overreacting and that maybe I am expecting too much from them. I don’t know. All of it feels really hurtful and some part of me thinks it maybe isn’t okay, but the other part of me remembers that humans aren’t perfect after all, just like everyone has told me. All I know is that I clearly have issues with knowing what is okay and what is not, and I need to learn myself what is normal behavior from people and what I can expect from them so that I don’t get abused or end up in bad situations. Where should I start and what do I do? 

If anyone has any advice then I’d love to hear. Thank you so much for reading.

"Hi it’s two in the morning when I’m writing this. I am so scared for my life right now I won’t lie. I had written in a previous post that my parents do not have the best relationship. My dad is very angry and violent and my family is scared of him. My parents are almost always arguing and it literally has broken my family to pieces. 

I don’t have much time to type it all out but I encouraged my mother to get a divorce while my dad and brother out of the house telling her how I don’t like the way he treats her, how he oogles other women, and how suicidal I used to be when I was young because of him (there was more but im rushing). She cried and promised she’d do something. She said she wouldn’t tell him.

She lied.

She just told him what I said at two in the morning and he’s losing his shit and they’re arguing. The cycle repeats. 

I don’t know how to live like this. 

It’s been like this for practically eighteen years and I’ll never be used to this."
"My step dad has almost a hatred for me and I don’t know why. He treats me and my brothers so differently it makes me feel like an outcast. He will not talk to me unless it’s to give me shit for something, yet he will have full conversations with both my brothers. But recently I have been talking to someone and we are getting into a relationship and he all of a sudden is nice to me only when my boyfriend comes around. It straight up feels like he’s trying to make a good impression with my boyfriend only, but he’s hurt me so much I don’t want anything to do with him. I have told my boyfriend some of the things he has done and he knows that I don’t have a relationship with him at all. It makes me upset that he can only have a conversation with me when my boyfriend is here yet when he’s gone he flips sides and becomes the person that shit talks me the most 😭😭😭"
"like one minute they scream and shout and fight. i've been dragged across a room by my hair before, slapped- punched, hurt sexually, once when i was little i had to take my little sister outside in nothing but my pjs and her in her underwear, leading to me taking my top off to give to her while it was winter out there because my mum was screaming and crying that we ate dinner because our dad told us too but our mum wanted us to wait. my mum has told me she wished the cancer i had as a kid killed me- that i was an accident, and that she blames me for the affair they are having.

but then the next they spend some of their money on me and seem to care and are nice to me and tell me they love me, and support me and i seem to think im overreacting. 

it goes 1. my parents hate me and make me hate myself 2. i internalise the hate and self sabotage 3. it makes them hate me more 4. i pull away 5. they are nice to me, and it makes me doubt myself 6. repeat forever

i feel like such a loser and a burden or an idiot and an asshole at all times. is this a well known cycle? idk what to call it."
"So hello everyone I am a girl residing in India and in my teens. I will keep it short and simple
I have been beaten up by my parents since a young age over trivial matter. But recently it has become more. My dad has begun to thrash me rashly so does my mom. Recently my dad became so angry when I asked a break from my studies that he came to my room , made sure he closed all windows and doors and then took me to the dining room and thrashed the hell out of me with a cloth hanger also punched and kicked me in front of my mom and she too told nothing. My thighs were all black blue with bruises and bruised stayed for more than three days. 
He is also continuously threatening to choke and kill me because it is waste for spending money on my education. 
Verbal abuse is also to the max level
Please tell me whta i should do Or should I keep quiet"
"I am 5'3, 19yo female weighing 115 pounds at most. I eat fast and I never go for seconds. I moved out of my abusive household and into my grandparents home and they are wonderful. The only thing that bothers me is grandpa keeps saying things like ""we eat four meals with you here, it's like me, grandma, you, and you"" or ""I know you're definitely hungry"" when ever food is mentioned. ""I'm sure you can finish off what ever left."" They really don't like left overs but are making way to much for three people to eat.

 I eat just as much as him at a meal and unlike him I don't eat breakfast, I don't snack, and I don't eat dessert. His comments are really bothering me and I truly think he thinks I am eating too much but I almost only eat one meal a day and don't always finish that meal. So idk why he is being so rude. 

He is also really pushy at trying to get me to eat any left overs. I don't know how to respond but it's pissing me off. It doesn't help that I have been having issues with bloating and gas lately. It makes me angry and I want to cry. I have never had issues with them outside of this. Idk what to do but I told him today I don't eat that much and he basically told me I was lying and he thinks otherwise (in somewhat of a 'joking' manner). At first I thought it was teasing but now I know it's not. Besides, he is probably 180 at the least with a dad bod so I feel like he is not in a place to judge me, a nearly anorexic teen that still wears smalls and mediums.

I don't want to be mean but I don't want to push this off cause I know it could escalate to a point that hurts me forever. How do I handle it? My first thought is to stop eating and leave the room when ever he does that but I feel like that's passive aggressive of me. My other thought was to just stop eating like I was before I moved but that led to a lot of health problems, probably why I am bloating and having a hard time digesting now that I am eating regularly-ish. 

The only thing I can think of that I do wrong when I eat is that I eat really fast. Growing up I just ate fast. We often ate in the car headed some where or right before leaving or going to bed. It's always been a rush to finish our food so it's really hard to eat slow. 

Ps: this is not the parents of my abusive mother, these are the parents of my non-abusive step father. "
"A lot of messed up stuff happened in my childhood, definitely things that should have never happened. I was always confused on whether my mom liked me or not. She'd say such cruel things to me and in the next breath act like we're best friends. She'd make fun of the way I looked, then copy my style. She'd act weird when I hang out with my stepdad and get jealous of me. I never knew what was true with her and what wasn't. I truly knew she didn't care about me after I told her about the weird stuff my step dad did. He kept pushing taboo topics and frankly disgusting sexual ideas towards me. Luckily he never did anything physical to me but that didn't make it any less messed up. I told my mother and she humiliated me in front of everyone then got mad at me. She stayed married to that man for 5 years after I turned 17 and moved out. It wasn't until recently she messaged me telling me that she believes what I said and is divorcing him. This all happened because he was secretly drugging her since I left. He also admitted to at least some of the weird stuff he said to me. 
After that I tried to reconnect with my mother but it didn't work out. She would bring up memories like they were happy occasions but I remembered it as exactly the opposite. I would see old glimpses of the woman I wasn't convinced and even like me. It was like she was desperately trying to pretend like everything was okay when it wasn't. After all that I wonder if I could ever really forgive her or trust her. I'm not really sure if she ever cared about me. I was always her least favorite child... "
"i don’t even know if she’s abusive or not but (as a girl) being around my own mother has affected the way i socialize with other women. she neglected me when i was born and my aunt was the one who raised me. she was more of a mother to me than she was. anytime i talk to her she yells at me and uses verbal abuse when i try to communicate. i’ve been told that i should respect her, and that i should ignore her, but how can i respect someone who’s been so awful to me? she acts nice to me only when she wants to be. her new relationship with her boyfriend has turned her into a worse person, she’s obsessed and she choose him over my sister and i. this hurts so much. 

i keep hoping that my mom will change and she will become a better person and i didn’t realize i had been hoping for this for 23+ years. this has been such an on going loop. i feel like i should hate her but i never could because she’s my mom. i can’t even move out because i don’t have a source… i feel abandoned by her almost. whenever i text her all she does is fight me and she blocks me. i feel awful. i feel desensitized towards her mistreatment towards me. i don’t know what to think of this.

"Something that makes me want to scream at people nowadays is how they think cartoons like The Secret of Nimh was traumatizing and they are only know realizing this. Or how they are so hardcore because they watched Faces of Death.

Traumatizing is having your mother put on porn to watch with you at 12 and up. Traumatizing is knowing if the day was going to be good or bad if she watched her brother/your uncles crime scene video and having his corpse in a red Mustang burned into your memory.

Please start teaching your kids the difference between reality and fantasy. 

And for the love of all that is holy and unholy please never watch porn with your kids. "
"I had a fight with my mom and she kicked me out. Told me she never wanted to see me again and many more nasty things. I didn't say a word to her. I have too much respect for her to say something back. I picked up my bags and left. I didn't want to speak to her, and the first thing she asked me through my dad was if I wanted to go to Disney with her. Not sorry. Not a hello. Not a hi. Nothing, just if I wanted to go with her somewhere after not speaking to her for almost two months now, what could that mean? That her only way of saying sorry was through money? I obviously said no, but it hurt."
"I’ve always felt like I was kind of weird. I want to say that I felt like I was different, but that would be a lie because I feel like everyone is unique. So, weird would be the word to describe me. Growing up, I was surrounded by family, but not in the way you might expect. During those times, my mom and dad would fight constantly, and I tried acting very unbothered, thinking it didn’t affect me because I wanted to be strong. My parents and I moved into a house in Miami, and my aunt who was in high school was living with us at the moment. My aunt was very smart. She was very brave for coming to Miami without her mom and dad in order to get a better education here, but she was constantly fighting with her Dad.

Later on, my Mom’s side of the family all came to move into our home from Honduras. It was chaos. I felt like I was watching a war. Everyone fought. My mom and my dad fought, my mom and my aunt fought, my grandpa and my grandma fought, my uncle and my aunt fought. It was exhausting at times, and the way I would cope would be to daydream. I loved to daydream. It felt like I was in my own little world away from everyone. It would sort of be my safe space where no one was able to touch me and where I wouldn't hear anyone.

My mom kicked out my grandpa, and eventually, everyone started to leave. I sort of felt relieved but also felt alone. I was always surrounded by people, and even though they were fighting, it was comforting to have everyone together. Since they were gone, my parents shifted their focus onto me and my sister. My mom holds a lot of anger in her, and to be honest, I can’t blame her. The things I heard about what she went through ate away at me. But she was very harsh with me sometimes, and I learned not to share personal things or do anything to give her a reason to yell, her words cut better than any knife.

 When I was younger, I would text my friends, and sometimes I would talk about my mom, which was almost never, and I mentioned how I thought she was scary. She checked my phone one day and looked through everything and saw that I said that about her. She was furious. I meant no harm in saying that, it was just she always yelled; I was oblivious when I was in the fifth grade. She screamed at me terribly. I remember she asked me, ""What are their parents going to think? I’m abusing you. Am I abusing you?"" I stopped talking about her after that. I never felt like I was close with her. What was the point?

"So to start this fiasco,
I woke up one morning, and immediately my abdomen was burning and felt super painful. I had nothing the night before in terms of pain, and no history of this ever happening. There's is however a history of appendicitis in my family. I tried standing up to go to the bathroom but I couldn't even stand up straight. I went to my mom's room and told her, ""Hey I think I need to go to the hospital"". Her response? Nope. Wait an hour.

So I'm sitting there on the couch in pain and feeling awful, and she's just sitting there, pretending nothing is happening. She then keeps asking me to rate my pain. I keep the numbers low only because in the past when I have told her about me being in real pain, she flips her shit and loses her mind. She then goes on to tell me how she has a migraine and how I should pity her and just shut up and deal with it. An hour later, I'm still in pain and she angrly decides I'm going to go to urgent care to prove her right.

So while we're driving to urgent care, I'm in the back trying to stay as still as possible to minimize the pain because it's really bad, and she sees that and hits EVERY speed bump possible. Making it so by the time we were actually at urgent care, I felt even worse.

We get in and the doctor sees me and is immediately like, yeah she should REALLY go to the hospital, like RIGHT NOW. And my mom sends me out of the room and I can here her telling the doctor ""oh she's lying, she's not sick, just tell her she should go home"" and thank GOD the doctor stood up to her and said ""this isn't a game, her life could really be at risk, do you want that on your conscious?""

So we drive to the hospital and the whole time she's telling me that I'm being so self absorbed for picking today to be sick and that I'm doing this to hurt her, and clearly this is a psychological problem with me. 

We get to the hospital and she watches me get checked in then fucking dips out of there. She then calls my neighbor and asks her to watch over me and leaves the entire state, not even joking. The doctors try to figure out what's wrong, they can't in the ER and they tell my to schedule somthing with my primary. So my neighbor brings me home, to which I discovered that she left entirely and I had no food. 

I then get a text later on that night and she rants about how her migraine was probably worse then any pain I had, and then she dodges all my calls and refuses to give me a date when she'll be back. 

As for my health, I don't give a shit anymore. I haven't taken any of the medicine, and Im not schedulling an appointment. I'm pretty uncaring of my life anymore and whether I live or die, so I don't care if I drop dead from this. Honestly I hope it happens, one so I can be free of this nightmare of a life I have, and so that they can finally see I wasn't faking it

"The title is the tldr really. 

This last Christmas I had a huge fight with mainly my mother and one of my sisters. It ended in crying, screaming, throwing stuff, the whole thing. 

I ended up leaving in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. After that I decided that this is it, I’m done. After all, I moved away from home a while ago, and I have a stable job. So I just went completely NC with my parents. 

But ever since then I’ve just felt, empty. It just feels like I’m all alone and like no one cares and that I’ve got no support system. Even though it’s not like my parents were much of a support system. 

There’s one thing my mother said that night that plays over and over in my mind. She said: “If I’m not there for you, who else is gonna be?”. And for some reason it feels like she was right. 

Thanks for reading. I really just wanted to get this off my chest. "

"(Please ignore anything grammar mistakes because english isn’t my first language and I don’t have a great vocabulary 😓)

I 15f have a dad that’s around early mid 40s. Ever since I could remember, my dad has always hit me for some kind of reason. (God bless my mommy, she never hit me, just yelled at me)I don’t remember most of them because I was very young but i’ll tell you the ones I do remember: When I was around 11-12 years old, I wanted to make some noodles to eat. I made some but I forgot the pot was still hot and like a dumb kid I didn’t use cloth to hold it. I was walking towards the kitchen table when I truly realized how hot it was. So I ended up dropping pot with all the noodles. My dad happened to see that and lucky for him, he had his belt on him. (you know what happened next.) 

The hitting has stopped for now but he’s still mentally abusive. I remember it so vividly. I was playing a game on my Ipad when I hear him call my name, so I go downstairs to see what he wants from me. “Go to the dishes. Ugh this house must be a pigs farm.” I got a lil annoyed at the pig joke so I ended making a little annoyed face. Unfortunately for me, he was right next to me while I was doing the dishes. He tells me to look at him with a slight annoyance and I look at him. “Why are u mad for? Stop making that face.” He rises his voice at me, and like my usual reaction I say, “This is how I always look.” And my dad goes, “ How dare you talk back to me!” and slaps me. I apologized and said i’ll fix my face so I smiled. Another similar situation happened but that time instead of slapping me he takes out a charging wire and starts hitting me. That was few months ago. 

Recently he started a truck job where he has to travel through states in North America. Few weeks ago, he called asking why I don’t call him,(like shouldn’t it be obvious)I ended up telling him I forgot and stuff. He’s usually out for 2-3 weeks and goes back to work in a few days.

Last time he came home, I was sleeping(12pm) and he calls me downstairs to clean the kitchen and do the dishes. He starts with his commenting again saying all that pig house stuff and how I as a women should be taking care of the house blah blah blah blah. I tuned him out because I was so tired of his nonsense. He was saying all that while in the kitchen with me so when he left, I start silently sobbing because I am still traumatized by him. I am afraid to stand up to him because he’s the “man of the house” crap. He recently started drinking too so I don’t know how much I have until he starts physically abusing me again. “I wish I could beat you again.” his words to me every once in a while.

Growing up, my sister (we’ll call her Ruth) was (and probably still is) my dad’s favorite. She’s 3.5 years older than me and was developmentally delayed to an extent. Ruth has auditory processing disorder, which is basically like dyslexia for hearing. She can’t focus on one sound with a bunch of background noise, so if you’re talking to her in an area with a lot of noise pollution, it’s hard for her to understand the first go around. My sister was born in 94, and the auditory processing disorder diagnosis came about in 95. She’s the oldest, so my parents were freaked out when Ruth wasn’t developing the way a normal child with no disabilities would. She couldn’t hear my parents talk to her half the time, so her speech was delayed. Before the diagnosis, my parents thought she would grow up to be put in a group home for adults. This never happened, because they figured out the issue and there was a treatment plan in place to help her through catching up with development and help her succeed in school. She turns 30 this year and I’m very proud of being her brother with all the hurdles she’s gone through with her auditory processing.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always felt like I wasn’t good enough for my dad. Nothing I did was good enough, even at 5 years old and dealing with bullying from girls at school because I was born a girl, transitioning when I was 18, and I didn’t fit the image of what the other girls wanted me to be. I got bullied a lot for things of that nature at school, and my sister also was bullied to some degree because of her disorder. She was always coddled by my dad, and I would get scolded. There was an instance of me being a kid and doing what kids do, my dad getting mad and picking me up and slamming against a closet door to yell in my face. When he let me down, I ran and hid in the pantry. He called my mom, sobbing and telling her he went too far. My mom didn’t know what exactly had happened until I had told her years later. 
It didn’t get better from there, because around 7 or 8, I told my mom I wanted my dad dead. I never had a good relationship with death growing up, because the finality of it all scared me and still does. If there were something serious that needed to be talked about, I always asked first if it was about death. All I knew about death at that point is that it’s the one thing that you can’t come back from, and if you’re dead, the person can no longer harm you. And that’s basically what it was. I didn’t describe how I wanted him dead, I just wanted him dead so he wouldn’t hurt me anymore. Terrified, my mom put me and my dad in therapy and I don’t really remember much about going through that. It didn’t fully fix things, but it healed them enough that I no longer would say that I wanted him dead. 
Don’t get me wrong, my mom and Ruth were also victims to my dad’s abuse. I just got the worst of it all. Ruth got slaps in the wrist compared to me and my mom. We weren’t raised religious, parents were both lapsed in their respective faith backgrounds, so Ruth and I were always (and still are) interested in learning about different religions. We learned a lot about Judaism, since my aunt and my cousin on my mom’s side are Jewish from how my grandparents raised them, but never a lot about Christianity. My dad has religious trauma from the religion and hated the notion of us even learning about God or Jesus or literally anything that had to do with the religion. We were (unfortunately) fans of a prominent Christian family shown on TLC and my dad hated that we watched the show. My sister had dated a boy in middle school who was Catholic, and my dad drilled into her about why she would want to convert to Catholicism when she was 14. That’s the kind of things Ruth would get. Meanwhile, I would get yelled at if I missed a goal during a soccer game, dropped a fly ball in softball, made any small mistake that a kid makes, etc. I was constantly trying to be better for my dad and I couldn’t never meet the high bar he had for me.
My parents divorced in 2012, but the start of it happened in 2009 when my dad was laid off from his job. He fucked us over financially because he never tried to get a good job again. He would get min wage jobs and get fired because he called off too much. He didn’t give a shit while my mom bent over backwards to make sure we survived. I won’t get into every detail of why he is the way he is, but it boils down to he’s never been allowed to hit rock bottom, he’s always had something there to catch him before he hits the ground. During them trying to work things out and not divorce, there was a time that my dad was screaming in my mom’s face, calling her every nasty name in the book, in the kitchen with me in the family room not even 20ft away and fully able to hear everything. I was on the computer and I wanted to escape to my room, but I remember thinking I couldn’t because if I did, my dad would bring me into the crossfires and use me against my mom. 
In 2013, the house they bought in 2007-2008 was foreclosed on and my mom and I moved about 40ish minutes to a different state and city. Ruth had just graduated high school, and I had just finished freshman year. I was furious that I was being ripped from everything I knew and blamed it on my mom when, looking back, it’s really my dad’s fault. I was an awful kid for sophomore and junior year, just very short, mean, and rude to my mom, and I regret it every day how bad I was. 2013 was also the year I went NC with my dad the first time. After various situations that happened around my birthday, one that I’ll talk about later, I went NC after my dad told me he wanted to see Ruth off to college after Thanksgiving and threw in my face how I wanted to see my then boyfriend on the day we usually see each other. The only good thing I can give to my ex is that he’s the reason why I got the guts to even go NC the first time. Ex was also not great, it would’ve turned abusive had the relationship continued, but that’s the one redeeming quality I can say about him.
I didn’t speak to my dad for 5 1/2 years. Over that time, my dad would lash out at my mom still, telling her that she’s feeding me lies about him so I don’t talk to him. Eventually, he seemed to get better. He’s an alcoholic, if he drank, he drank heavily, and he stopped drinking at some point during that time. I personally do not drink because of the things that occurred when he was drunk. It wasn’t much except he was incredibly scary and was more prone to yelling at people while intoxicated. He also went into therapy and started actually doing better.
During this time as well, my mom went through a cancer diagnosis (to which she has survived and been declared in remission) my junior year, at one point I saved her life after she collapsed from severe dehydration, graduated high school, had to move unexpectedly a month after graduation, went through trade school and got my hair license, transitioned and started HRT, found out the day after I got my license that we were being evicted, my mom and I were homeless for 2 months, and we finally got back on our feet by the time I started speaking to my dad again. I recognize that I’m dependent on my mom, still am as I live with her, but we are the only ones we can depend on. My aunt doesn’t live in the same state and my cousin lives overseas. During this period, Ruth was away at college so she couldn’t do much to help either. We only had each other, it’s been me and her against the world since 2012. We’ve struggled financially over the years but we always seem to make it work.
In March 2019, about two months before Ruth graduated from college, my dad and I met in a public place with my mom nearby to talk about everything that went on up until that point. From what I remember, a lot of the things I said to my dad were things he never considered and he seemed to take things to heart and wanted to change. This was the first of 3 times he has apologized to me. Things got better somewhat, but Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither do fixing strained relationships between a parent and child. For about a year after this, I tried initiating conversations about the past in gentle ways. Every time, he would freeze up and get very silent and I would feel like I had to change the subject every time. He never once tried talking to me about things whenever I brought them up and, after a while, I just stopped.
In 2022, I went NC a second time because he was hoenstly being a fucking dick over a car he had 0 ownership over. I had gotten a car the previous August and it was a stupid purchase, if only because I spent what I paid for in car payments in repairs as well during the first year alone. He tried telling me not to do something with it, I don’t remember what, and I told him
not to contact me until I reached it to him. This lasted 2 months, we met in a public place again with my mom and this time his girlfriend and talked things out again. This is the second time he’s ever apologized to me.
A common theme of all this is I’m not a priority to my dad. My dad can talk about the trauma he went through growing up, the trauma he caused my mom and assumedly my sister (we don’t talk about our dad in that way, I’m not putting Ruth in the middle of all this and she is the type to want to find a solution even if there is none), apologize to my mom on numerous occasions, often unprompted, but I can count on one hand how many times he’s apologized to me. The third time happened last year out of the blue, where he called me crying about how he feels bad for ruining our relationship for the years we didn’t speak and he wanted to make things right. I felt it was genuine, and I had thought this was opening a door to future discussions. It did not, obviously, since I’m here writing this post.
The weekend of mother’s day, my dad sent me and Ruth several screenshots of a trauma dump he did on a social media site. I didn’t read any of it, frankly, it pisses me off still that he even dumped that on us out of the blue not even considering the circumstances, and I ignored the conversation he and Ruth had about it. I vented to my mom about it, saying that it hurt that he can just dump his trauma on me but I can’t do the same for the trauma he caused me. Later that evening, my dad texted my mom and apologized for the millionth time for a situation she doesn’t even remember. She told my dad he shouldn’t be apologizing to her, as he has numerous times in the past already, and that he should really apologize to me. There was a little back and forth, and eventually my dad texts me the next day asking what my mom meant. So I told him. I told him how I’ve never felt like I was a priority to him, how I wasn’t even on the list of people to make amends with, how I never felt good enough for him no matter what I did, and how I had to basically coddle him talking about this in the past. I told him how it hurt knowing that he’s apologized to my mom so many times yet I can count on three fingers the times he’s apologized to me. I told him it feels shitty to see him be open about his own trauma but I can’t do the same to him. Eventually, I mentioned how I knew Ruth had always been his favorite. That is what set him off. He told me that he didn’t have a favorite child, it was a bullshit statement, and that he no longer wanted to have this conversation over text. I said I would only meet with him if my mom could be there to mediate, because I’m not trusting him to do this alone. He agreed, told me to pick a time and place, and we would meet. He even texted my mom saying he understood why I wanted her there and thought it was a good idea.
The next day, I decided on a park in the city I finished high school in, we have an elderly dog with anxiety and it would be easier to do that than to find a sitter, and texted him asking if that park was okay at this time. He messages me back to ask why that park. I asked, why does it matter? You told me to pick a place and I did. He sends back, well, the last time we were meant to meet at this park, you stood me up. 
This is the situation I alluded to earlier. Because during this time I wasn’t the best, my mom had taken my phone away. I had either just turned 16 or about to, and there was a rally for a tax levee that the marching band was playing at. The rally was at the park I chose. My dad was meant to pick me up from the park so we could go celebrate my birthday. The city I graduated HS from is very small, I lived right behind the high school and I could get to this park in 20 minutes, if not faster. When I couldn’t find my dad, and having no way of getting into contact with him, I figured I would walk home and, if he couldn’t find me at the park, he would assume the same. He didn’t. Instead, he called to yell at my mom, blaming her for why he couldn’t find me and how shitty she is, then yelled at me in the car once I got in. I was a sophomore in HS at this point, 16 or nearly there. I was a kid. I didn’t “stand up” my dad on purpose.
Things went back and forth from there. I told him he’s holding a grudge for over 10 years at this point, that I also have bad memories with this park (HS ex broke up with me at this park in the worst and cold hearted way), and that I didn’t choose this park as a malicious attack against him. I honestly chose the park because it’s small, I know the park well enough that, in the event one of us gets lost, it would be easy to find each other. It’s a fucking park. He didn’t put any stipulation on where it could be, so I chose that park. He told me he doesn’t feel comfortable meeting at this park because I stood him up and tried using my bad memories as a gotcha on why we should change locations. I stood firm, telling him that this is an uncomfortable situation and he should feel uncomfortable. I said we are doing this by my terms, we are meeting at this park or it’s not happening at all. 
He throws back, okay, we can do it at the park, but your mom can’t be there. I said no, we are doing this on my terms or not at all. I stood firm on this, even going as far as threatening to go NC again if he didn’t meet me where I stood. I’ll be honest, I only said it as a scare tactic because he’s admitted to my mom he’s scared of me going NC again. Except he didn’t blink at the threat, just kept going on about how I’m being unreasonable and he isn’t responsible for the stories I make about him in my head, basically calling me delusional. So I told him not to contact me again. I blocked him everywhere, including his number. I messaged his girlfriend to inform her of the situation, telling her if he tries to contact me through her, I will block her as well.
Since then, it’s been hell. I have a laundry list of medical issues, a lot of them being nerve issues. I had carpal tunnel at 18 and got surgery for it while in hair school. I’ve known the whole time I’ve been cutting hair I’m doing so on borrowed time, and this year, I started college to get a degree for when I can no longer do hair. My hands started being an issue again in March. I figured it’s because I take handwritten notes and I cut hair, and it’ll go away once the semester ends. It didn’t, it only got worse. 3 weeks after the end of the semester, my right wrist started hurting but didn’t impede on my work. Until a week later when I had to leave work to go to urgent care because the pain was too much for me to cut hair. I tried cutting hair again the next day, same thing and again, it happened the day before I saw ortho. X-rays looked fine, so I was ordered an MRI that didn’t happen until about 2 weeks ago. MRI doesn’t show anything except normal wear and tear, and my only next step is to get an EMG (a nerve test). If that’s inconclusive, I’m shit out of luck. 
Because it hurts to cut hair, my hours at work have been cut significantly. I can only reception work on the weekends, so I’ve received a 20 hour cut, plus the tips I’d normally get to help beef up my paycheck aren’t there. I’ve already been struggling keeping my head above water since January of this year, and right before my current round of medical issues, I was almost in the clear. My pay has been cut to 20%, if that, of my normal weekly take home. I don’t qualify for help through United Way, the things I need help paying (car payment for a car I purchased after the lemon I had, loans, and credit cards) aren’t listed as options. My mom is lucky to work for a fantastic hospital and covers the majority of our bills, but she’s getting a total shoulder replacement 8/2. She does have short term through her employer, so at least there’s that.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m trying to find a job, but nobody will call me back for an interview. I keep getting rejection after rejection. The one interview I’ve had didn’t hire me, though that manager is trying to get me hired at a different store but who knows. I have bills to pay and I’m only getting a fraction of what I normally get. I’m home all the time and I feel so fucking helpless. I’m reaching my fucking limit on what I can handle. Nothing good has happened to me since going NC. I feel worthless and stupid. I feel like I’m annoying all my friends because I have too much time. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what can be done at this point. I’m lucky I still have health insurance through my job, and I need good health insurance with the amount of medical issues I have. I’m scared every day and I feel like
I’m going to throw up constantly. My appetite is shit, I’ll go hours without eating and only do so when my blood sugar drops low enough my CGM alerts me of it, if I do eat, I have to eat my safe foods because I will go through making something, only to sit down, maybe take a bite or two, before my body decides that it doesn’t want that. My sleep is shit, even worse than during the semester. I feel like I’m on the verge of a panic attack constantly and I don’t want to burden my friends when they have their own shit. I’ve asked for help from friends and family, and only 3 people and $45 have come my way.
I don’t know anymore. I feel like I’m being punished for cutting out my dad again. I know I’m not, it’s just a coincidence, but I can’t help but feel that way. Everything was fine for a week after the semester ended to this all starting. Nothing bad happened until I went NC. I wonder if things would get better if I reached out, but I know it will only cause me more stress. I feel like I’m drowning and everyone is watching and not helping.
Thanks for reading if you do. Be kind to one another."
Ik many people may have this problem but why dose my father just throw things at me and act like he never did?
"So I noticed my dad does this thing where he will listen to my conversations with my sister, mom etc, and I obviously won’t know. It can be something as simple as my sister and I talking about my door sagging and my sister saying someone should fix it. This happened weeeeks ago. A very unimportant comment in my opinion? Today my sister “lazily” closed my door (according to my dad) so the door made an awful noise when it hit the ground. My dad said something along the lines of “I heard you say it should be fixed but you can just lift the door don’t be fuckin lazy.” This time his remark was more tame but there have been multiple times in the past where he will bring something up and sort of use it against me, without me knowing he knew about it. It will mostly be conversations. I sometimes feel betrayed by this.

Am I overreacting? I feel like I have ptsd and am easily triggered. I have been feeling more sensitive since attending therapy and while I have progressed a lot in the past year I feel like I have a long way to go. The fact that Im easily triggered makes me feel like Im going backwards, but my therapist says it might be because I’m surpassing things and setting boundaries so it opens up some past trauma. "
"I'm going to be short, I have parents who abused me when I was little, they liked me to participate in their sexual acts, first as a spectator and collaborator in certain acts such as cleaning my father's genitals with a stocking or inflating used condoms; The most thing they made me do was clean my father with my mouth, they laughed and so did I, I was little and I didn't really understand what happened until I was eleven years old.

All my life they denied what happened, to the point of making me doubt myself, but they continued their abuse, mocking me, hitting me, and humiliating me in every way possible (typical narcissists).



As an adult, when they were divorced, my mother kicked me out of the house and it was only then that I was able to get away from them and have contact 0

Today I am married (marriage in trouble) and with a 5-year-old son who is the best thing in the world, my wife does not believe what happened to me, perhaps because I never gave her specific details (it is difficult for me to give them, he was very small and those ""games"" with my parents were not traumatic events like my mother's beatings were for example) but the fact is that I am firm that if it happens and she says that my parents do not seem like the kind of person who would do that (as if they were carrying a sign that says ""I'm a pedophile"")

my problem:

Yesterday I fooled myself that I was going to take our son to his night job and then with her to a friend's house and in reality he was at my mother's house, I hate her for that, as soon as I found out we argued, I still haven't seen in person at the time of writing this

I love her with all my soul and it makes me cry to have to abandon her, but I don't see any other way out, although if I stopped being close to him maybe my son would be more at risk.



What should I do?"
"Hello! 

Upon reading some post here, most are relatable to my family and my background. 

I’m 22 years old, I work as a call representative full time. I learned to drive on my own because my dad was physically abusive to me as a teenager. He would punch me in the face and spray coke soda on my face. He would turn off the lights and internet to prevent me from submitting my homework. I believe this is what started my cycle of just giving up things I start. 

My mom has pulled my hair, called me ugly, bruised me, and told me to kill myself. 

At 22 years old, I want to move out. I want to go back to school for the sciences. 

Not for them. But for me. 

The thing is I don’t know what I want to do for school. When I went to community to figure it out, my dad punched me in the face during it so I withdrew. 

I know that I can’t enter school while living in an abusive home. But I want to leave. I want to move on. 

What advice would you provide on an escape safe plan with the goals I have? 

Thank you for any upcoming advice. 

And for those experiencing the same, I haven’t gone out of the situation yet, but know you aren’t alone and there’s a way out. Keep going and dream big, don’t let your parents limit you and break the cycle. "
I just need some hope
"I and my younger sisters experience daily emotional and physical abuse from my mother. I don't know what to do. Even today my back got whooped with wire only because I didn't wanted to go to store. Everyday my mother reminds me of how much of a mess i am and without me i would die. My feelings and opinions disregarded. She tells me to kill myself if I don't like something in house. She would constantly remind me of how whore i am and all i can do is please men, even though i never had friends(mainly because she shit my friends behind their back and would always tell me to stop talking to them or else she will break my face or phone ).  She would make fun of me and call me r word for having obvious autistic behaviour. I can't draw or have any hobbies, because what i do is always ""pointless and will only slow me down"". She threatened me that she will break my hands, if i keep drawing. She would remind me how much i look like my father. I hate my father. She throws at me heavy things or even worse, knifes. She would whoop my back if i do something bad like disagree with her. She would beat me even in public. And this whole stuff happens to my siblings too! I feel like it's going to be only worse as time passes. I actually consider harminh myself and i lost all my motivation because of her. I can't call CPS because none of them will take the problem seriously. My father is abusive too, he's not the type of person who would help or love. No relatives will take care of us. I'm scared for my little sisters and myself, i cant do anything. I want normal life but idk how to get it without being left with no home and money to survive"
"When I was learning to drive with my dad, it was a constant barrage of criticism, running commentary, shouting, and being treated as though I was an idiot.

It got to the point where I tried to avoid going out for drives, as I couldn't take his abuse. 

I've had enough. Once I've passed my practical test (UK) and have my own car again, I won't be taking him as a passenger."
"My best friend, who I will be calling Duck, has an emotional abusive mom and I want to get the police involved.

  
Duck is 12 while I am 13, she is like a sister to me. We grew up together, even lived with each other for 2 years. her mom is a really crappy parent. She does not give Duck privacy, lets her boyfriend call her names and laughs about it, favorites Duck's younger brother over her, and this morning she told Duck she doesnt care about her feelings. Plus a lot more is happening.

  
Now as a kid who also has an abusive mother figure, I understand what its like, though Duck has it way worse. I want to help any way I can. Duck's dad is very supportive of her and we already have told him everything going on. He has been trying to get custody of Duck for a while now and I want to help him as much as possible.

  
At first I wasnt sure if I should get involved but I don't really care anymore, I will do anything for Duck at this point to get her out of that house.

  
What I plan to do is first get evidence. I am going to tell Duck to try to record a few times when her mom is being a jerk. Then next time I go over to Duck's house for a sleepover I am going to call the police, I will tell them everything and show them the evidence Duck recorded. I want to be there in case things get bad with her mom. Currently her mom is pregnant but should be giving birth soon so hopefully she wont be pregnant by the time this happens for the sake of Duck's little sister.

  
I try my best to support Duck and I try to plan as many sleepovers and hangouts as possible to get her out of her mom's house. I comfort her when things get hard and give her advice. She knows how bad her mom is too and hates it. Both of us are hoping to get her away from her mom. 

  
If anyone has any advice on how to get her dad full custody or make the police actually take any of this seriously, I will happily take it. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

  
"
I went out to my friends bday party and I came home at a reasonable time (10 pm) and my dad was so mad. I am 20 and he is telling me i have to ask him for permission whenever im going out. and everytime i come back from somewhere fun with my friends they ruin my mood at the ride back home. i am so tired of being depressed at home i wanna be happy. i hate my parents. he is punishing me for going out by making me wake up at 9 am to cook breakfast for everyone. i feel like a maid in my own house. i havent even properly got time to sleep 
"My relationship with my father has been complicated. He's told me before that if any other parent had to deal with me they would've left a long time ago. Lately he's been telling me how he hates his life and how he doesn't get anything out of going to work and providing for everyone. Not just with him but with my mom as well, I feel like a trauma dump for both of them. Both of them complain to me over and over again not only about each other, but about their own upbringings. Even after I got sent to a psych ward due to self harming, they didn't bother to even try to change one bit. But back to my main point, my dad told me not to be surprised if he drives himself off a cliff and even went as far as to ask me if I'd forgive him if he killed himself. So I'm really worried about him now and if he does do it, its gonna be my fault and I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. Earlier today he was yelling at me for not sleeping with my ex(It was my first relationship so I wanted to take it slow but that's a whole other topic)and he said that it’s my fault she left me. Then he went on to talk about how sex should be my number one priority as an 18 year old boy. At that point I just broke down crying to which he started yelling at me asking me why I was crying and threaten to leave for good if I don't tell him why. He didn't seem to have even an ounce of sympathy. A couple days later when I told him that she broke up with me, I got yelled at like 3-4 times. Even when I asked him to leave me alone multiple times he just kept continuing to yell and yell at me. He went on to tell me that it's all my fault because I didn't sleep with her. He then went on to tell me (yelling) how women only want two things: sex and money. and when I don't listen to him, he again, threatens to leave the family and take everything away. I feel like I'm watching my whole family fall apart and there's nothing I can do about it. If you read my last post, you know my ""family"" isn't really a family. I just want all of this to end. All I wanted was I don't know, a hug from my father? That would've been nice... maybe for him to not yell at me when I need his support the most? A couple weeks ago he told me about how if he was like everyone else, he would’ve disowned me a long time ago. I feel so alone... not even my own family cares about me it seems like... I've been considering another suicide attempt and I'm really scared."
"Im 18 yrs old, live in the PH and I think it's time for me to voice out about what my parents did to me.

Mom currently threw a plastic plate in my head which resulted to gush out a lotta blood. I only stopped the bleeding when I finally apply cloth to it. The worst part is? My lil sis witnessed this whole situation. It would be really traumatic for her despite not really knowing what's going on. Ofc this includes myself as I'm crying and panicking a lot when it bled.

I would've gotten stitched my head but I don't really have enough money for it so it's really difficult. Physically I'm dealing with a headaches, fatigue, bruise and swelling (mostly at my head injury) and mentally I am dissociating, depressed, and confused.

I only got checked up publicly so since I can't get it stitched- i drink a lot of antibiotics and painkillers. It's what the doctor prescribed to me. However the healing process won't be fast. I know.

I won't get a job for a while bc of my head injury. I don't wanna think too much as- this triggers me more headaches.

Anyways back to what my parents did. They were ashamed of what they did. But I fear they might do this again. Since in their minds I believe they have some sort of generational trauma where abuse was tolerated and won't really realize that it's fully wrong. Mentally they also emotionally abused me a lot. And I haven't responded to them nicely which yeah- resulted to put myself in a dangerous situation.

I would've report them to the authorities but I have the fear of them going to prison. I only want them to realize that it's wrong. I don't want their lifetime to be spent in prison.. I don't want gossips to be heard all over by my neighbors or my relatives, coz yeah that would be really stressful for me and my lil sis.

So I just had to make excuses about the cause of my head injury. Like I got tripped at the corner. (When that's not rlly the cause I know, kind of pains me)

Currently she's taking care of my wound which is expected because it's my mom's fault. But its kinda really boring to stay here at bed for the whole day. And when I get better, I'm looking forward to get out because it's dangerous to put myself and my lil sis here for too long. 

It's not always they'd do something this physically abusive. But yeah I always fear it gets there due to their lack of emotional management/intelligence.

And about my dad.. he was not there when this situation happened. Since he's currently working. Ofc it is frustrating for him to witness this. But it seems like he's not really taking this as a big deal so.. I'll say that dad hasn't been the greatest dad himself. He's got a past history where he hurts my mom and is a massive cheater.

This family is just messed up and I don't know what to do except to escape outta here."
"So my Mother is now a bit older (64) and i just got 20 years old (Male). I think i have been verbally, emotionally and physically abused for my, i dont know, whole life. One of my problems is that i dont see how i can get out of this situation and the other is that i feel great shame and guilt. I always ask myself if i was better, would it be that bad? 

To state some things that she did for context:

-Once when i was 13 years old, i wanted to go with a friend (girl) of mine, which i really loved and cared for for a outdoorpool. To just hang out a bit with her and some other friends of our class. My mother had a little nap. I had to wake her up so she lets me out of the house, because back then, if i didnt tell my mother i would go outside, she wouldnt let me in, till we would clash again for an hour. So i woke her up to tell her i go outside. She then bashed out, screaming loud asf, and then took a knife and rushed at me. I fell backwards on my back running from here and hit my head (ouch) and started crying really hard because i really got scared. Dude i  really thought i was about to die, and that that was it. This was the first time she rushed at me with a knife and where i got hella scared. There were many other times she did it, where she said shed kill me and stuff but i kinda got used to it over time, so i wasnt scared anymore that much. 

-She verbally abused me my whole life, told me i was shit, that i was dumb, that i cant sit still ( ihave diagnosed adhd but she doesnt give a shit), cant behave, that i should fuck my self (even at a young age!). There were thousand different things she told me. And the thing is that i dont give a shit about it no more. She still slurs at me to this day. When i think about it: It scares me, that i dont care. Do you guys get that feeling? I told my new GF about this topic with my mom and she was so surprised and stuff and told me that she couldnt imagine that. I was kinda confused because i didnt think its a big deal to that point. I knew i was getting abused, but was it really that bad, i was asking myself. I was reassuring myself, that this happens also to other etc.

-She bite me multiple times, literally. It kinda hurt and i was confused and scared. I was kinda young.

-I cant wear the things i want, and if so, i have to go through a big Conversation (AT 20 YEARS OLD BRUH)

-She forced me to go to school and be a doctor lmao (the normal thing immigrant parents do). Well now im starting with University but im studying History and Philosophy (for the start: i might switch up some things; literature interest me as an example). My mother is really disappointed in me because i want to study in these fields. Well, i actually believe she has a valid point in this critic as a parent. But still, these fields are what interest me the most and what i love to do.

-I just finished school last month, and she then told me that i am a lazy prick that doesnt go to work, because i had some freetime. I then found a job, applied and got accepted. It pays decent and its a cool job because you help people in need and i thnik thats better than workin in Mcdonalds feeding into the consumerism of people nowadays. Well, as i got the job, she said: No YOU CANT HAVE A JOB, YOU HAVE UNIVERSITY STARTING. And i got confused because she told me to get one, now i got one and then this. And then she tells me paranoid shit like: They might sell your organs and kidnap you (Btw my mother is blatantly stupid, im glad im adopted and have not this monkey genes in common with her, but she is still my mother) Then she told me that i have to give her bank account info so the money goes to her. When i said no she screamed, hit me (it didnt hurt, but the screaming is hella annoying), then wanted to call to my job and say i wnt do it (bruh?)

- She physically abused me in my childhood, where i was a really vulnerable child. She doesnt hit me nowadays as much, because she realized that i dont give a f\*uch about her. She got weak.

- She is sick and constantly tells me that she is dying and i dont know what to do. Well she goes to the doctor and does all the stuff yk. But it still hurts her telling me that she is going to die. She always plays this card when were arguing. For example when i want to go out for a little while, she tells me that shes sick and is dying. (She aint even that sick for context, she still is able to perform as good in life as before, she just gets into these sick phases some times. and then i have to do everything. She mainly does the cooking and the rest is often up to me like cleaning etc.)

- My mother acts as if im her property. She wants to decide everything about my life, she wanted to marry me to a girl i absolutely hated, i refused, she screamed the shit out of her soul, got nearly a heartattack, proceeds to give the faults to me

- Often when i want to go out with the boys she overcomplicates everything and says that i love my friends more than her Blah blah blah. Im not even going out for a party or doing drugs. Then she wants to call the police because of my behaviour. (i was fucking 19 years old, is this normal dude i cant even get out of the House man) She ends up calling her brother for reassure herself and tells him how bad i am etc. her brother always tells her to just let me do these tings and that it is normal. Btw My whole ass family back in my country hates me because of the portrayal my mother gives of me, but they dont like her that much either (I fully understand them)

-She is the most irresponsible human being i have ever come across. She always gaslights me into thinking every wrong doing of her is because of ME. Occasionally, when she walks and just nearly slips, she screams at me, for no reason. I believe she is emotionally unstable. 

- She hates  one of the only person i love right now and wants to ruin our relationship. For Context im from Swtizerland, my mother is an immigrant from Kosovo. We both live in switzerland and she alsways accused me of becoming too much like a swiss peson. I always rebuttal, i tell her that i just want to be myself and that i dont see myself as albanian nor swiss because i always tell her that i dont give a fuck about nationality. My girlfreind (19 years old) is such a cool person, i love it. But she is swiss, which is no problem for me, but for my mother. We often fight over her. She tells me i have to marry an albanian girl. I hate albanian people, i dont know why, just had bad experiences with them. I dont want to generalize things, but i guess im a bit racist then.

- My mother is hyperconservative, traditonalisitc, hella racist, hateful about everything, nationalistic, dogmatic, and really into islam. (I left islam. I kinda hate religion. Islam in particular. The arrogance of it surprises me) 

- She always makes me feel guilty about everything that happen to her. Telling me i cant leave her or else bad things will happen (guess what)

- She doenst know how to talk about topics formally and constructive. Evrything she says is destructive and dogmatic and dude im dead angry about it. Im always surprised when i see others talking to their mothers like normal people. Dude HOOOOOW????!!

- My dad died. I believe my mother is overly controlling because of that, because she has noone left. Her husband is dead, he suddenly died in an accident, which is why my mother doenst let me go out of the house without a big dispute. I believe my mother is a really broken person.

- When i told my mother that i have a psychiatrist she got angry at me and told me to not say anything that happens under the house (so the main problems in my life) I told her that i just wanted to know ways to handle shte stress of schoold better with adhd etc (I never had stress in school, it was easy and i had never put any effort in it, and only skipped classes, I mean i still passed everything so all good). She didnt belive me and hit me, screamed at me, and then i cried again. 

- My mother is ashamed of me and openly tells everybody about it, how ugly i am, how dumb i am, how i only read books ( i dont know what her fucking problem is abot reading and i am not even that ugly my girlfriend is a hell of a grilfriend, really pretty and she thinks i am pretty too.

Now to the bigger problem. I sometimes feel great shame and guilt about the life of my mother and i cant imagine the pain i would feel if i cut her off. She would feel lonely. Sometimes it feels as my responsibility to make sure she might have a good life. I told my Psychiatrist that i really feel bad for my mother and that i want to help her but its hard and i dont know how. My teacher told me i should get out, but its hard. THIS is so easy said but its hard, its not even a financial thing dude, just the emotional thing that destroys me. My psychiatrist told me about that i have built a defensive mechanism because of my mother, which explains my emotinal numbness sometimes. But sometimes i have moments of great psychological pain where i start crying and feel bad about everything that has happened. Im sure my mother had a really hard life but i dont know what to do i feel so stressed about it and pressured. I just cant figure it out. Everyone tells me to just get away but it feels wrong to leave a broken person behind alone!! How is she gonna manage? How is she going to feel? I think its blatanlty egoistic to just leave her behind. I mean doesnt she need help too? She might be just as broken as i am right now? I mean i already feel bad about not spending much time with her, i berricade myself in my room so to speak haha. 

Anyway, my qustion is.. How would you handle such a situation without moving out? I want to have a good relationship with my mother. I really do. Thank you for reading:

Here is some things about me (I have also flaws)

- I have ADHD, which is why i am really disorganized and forgetful

- I am a very lazy person

- I am very sarcastic and too open. I am very direct, which sometimes can hurt people, but i dont mean it with bad intent.

- I had a phase where i locked all my emotions up and never told anyone about it (Now i feel in very good touch with them)

- I am suicidal

- I am a very indifferent person at times, and i rather laugh at my life than take it seriously ( My best cope)

- My humour can get very mean to peoples feelings

- I am everything my mother hates and the reason why she feels ashamed, she thinks i looks homeless and ugly and she wants to cut my hair off make me bald bro i dont want to be bald. 

- I am very insecure about my self (My girlfriend helps me with this, i love her so much dude, i love love its so fascinating how she can see love me so much, i miss her rn :( Im seeing her on thursday :D

- I have anxiety issues but im trying to fix them

- I am overly self critical

- I have hated myself for a long time, and was really afraid of making bounds with other people

- I can get disrespectful towards authority figures 

- My mood is shifting very often

- Im very cyncial and nihilistic, really pssimistic at times

So yeah thats about me. ive seen most people on here only pointing out flaws about their parents so here also about me so you have a bigger picture of us.

"So I contacted the authorities on my parents and they're aware that social services are coming round to our house on Thursday this week. My parents were extremely shocked and angry and now I feel like I was being dramatic and I want to kill myself. Like my parents are going to flip out about what i said, about how they're abusive and how I tried to kill myself multiple times. 

I honestly need to know what I should do and need comfort honestly.

"I'm a 26 year old woman and a friendless neet,I'm stuck living with my family and I suffer of some kind of untreated mental illness that gives me rage attacks and I tend to fight a lot with my siblings and my parents, but the latter always tend to be more sweet to my siblings and angrier with me, even when I'm in the right.
Also neither mum or dad believe I have psychological problems and think I'm just a lazy person who enjoys doing nothing all day and being always alone (last time I had friends was 10 years ago) so they do absolutely nothing to try to help me in a serious way.
Yesterday I had a rage attack and mum and dad told me to take my own life while pointing to the balcony and today mum laughed at me while I was having a panic attack which made me suicidal and I don't know what to do anymore,I just wanted help to understand if they are abusive or it's all my fault."
"(tw for swearing, and suicidal ideation) so i (15), live with my mom the majority of the time, my parents are divorced so i see my dad a few months out of the year. my mom is pretty damn abusive. Im still coming to terms with it but she has done a whole bunch of shit that is 100% abusive or neglectful. A few of them are leaving the house, turning the internet off and never telling me where she was going or if she was coming back, threatening (and actually doing it at one point) to take my door off, also picking the lock to my room, I literally had to use duct tape to tape it shut so she wouldn’t break in.

I have an eating disorder also, but she just refuses to even attempt to understand it. She will buy a bunch of food that I literally cannot eat and then will get upset that im not eating anything. She always plays the victim, always. I called her out on it once and she just straight up walked away and refused to apologize. every single thing i do is her fault. I cant get out of bed? Oh poor mom, dealing with such a lazy child. Room isnt clean? Im so sorry i let this continue for so long, im such a bad parent. not finishing schoolwork on time? We should send you to your dads, you always finish schoolwork there.

speaking of dad, yeah, he also fucking sucks. Like genuinely he is the worst human being i have ever met. Mom knows about this too, she just refuses to comfort me because ”you have to see him again eventually, so theres no point in complaining. Oh yeah, hes also borderline transphobic, and also sort of homophobic. I came out as asexual a while ago and he just straight up said i was lying and i will change my mind. He refuses to take any accountability for why i very vocally hate being at his house. Its always that the dogs are too loud, or that bedtime is 8 pm (which ??? I mean yeah it sucks but its not abusive), or that i just hate my sister. Shes really young, like less than 5, and shes actually way nicer and genuinely the only reason why i dont fight to hell to not go there. I love her more than anyone else is that house, and shes the only reason im considering not fully cutting contact when i turn 18, and probably why I haven’t killed myself yet.

anyways, he constantly makes fun of my interests, my appearance, my clothes, my friends. Everything he can make fun of in some way he will. I wanted a computer and got so much shit for calling the computer a she, like i just thought it was pretty?? people with boats do that too, you didnt have to make fun of me for a straight hour at a restaurant, in front of people. He also will rant about how he has to “dumb down his language“ around people and how smart he is. how much of a good father he is. He literally gave me a fucking trauma disorder, and then parades around like hes father of the year because he didnt immediately murder me for saying i might be nonbinary. Still makes a bunch of transphobic jokes, and also misgenders me all the fucking time.

he yells at me constantly. He yells at literally everyone actually. my sister, our dogs, our cats, anyone he can yell at, he will. I got screamed at for leaving an empty soap bottle out, my mom reuses them, i forgot he didnt. And i got fucking screamed at so hard i started crying, over a fucking soap bottle. oh, also he jokes about things i say either when i was crying or during an argument. Its his fault as much as moms, because shes the one who tells him everything i say. I am five seconds away from either completely staying in my room 24/7, or killing myself. Dont know which yet.

yeah, thats pretty much it, ANY advice would be helpful, i am genuinely unsure of what to do. Sorry if the grammar is sloppy, i just really needed to vent. edited it to clear something up and general grammar"
"I dont really know what to say. My parents had a huge argument. As they have for a long time now, I couldnt handle it anymore and I opened their room door and joined in against him. He disrespected my mom, my entire family on her side and me. He started calling me things and started telling me to come st him if im such a “big boy.” I charged at him, didnt really hit him, just pushed him down against his bed and my mom tried pulling me off, but as soon as he got bsck up i pushed him right back down. I hate myself for it. Although my family fought a lot, things were slightly showing signs of improvement, but now he threatened to call the police, file for a divorce and try to take my sister(his and my moms) Forgive me if this has gramatical errors or if its completely incomprehensible, my minds all over the place."

My mother prioritizes spending on herself and her boyfriend over my siblings and me. Last month alone, she spent $100 on lingerie while I've only received a $10 pair of jeans in the past year, despite the fact that my clothes look really worn out. I've stopped complaining because begging her only results in being screamed at and getting called spoiled. She basically saves any money that she should spend on her kids, so that she can invest it in her own stupid stuff.

Recently, I asked her to buy a $30 music event ticket for me as everyone in my class is attending. Normally, I would never spend this much, but I have been excited about this since months and was overjoyed when my friends asked me to go with them. Despite initially agreeing and purchasing them, she abruptly changed her mind within like 5 minutes. Now she insists I give her the money back and has resorted to insulting and calling my friends “retards”. She labeled me an ""asshole"" and sternly reminded me that I'm no longer a child anymore (her usual “subtle” threat of her being able to kick me out). Furthermore, she declared she'll never buy anything for me again.

I'm hurt and confused. I simply wanted to enjoy a common activity with friends, yet I ended up being berated and belittled. Feeling completely pathetic being hurt over something seemingly so unimportant. I don’t even know what I am supposed to do, I don’t have any money on my own and I cant’t even pay her pack now as she already bought them.

"Social services came round today to discuss housing. I tried to tell the social worker that me staying with family isn't an option. Social worker wasn't very happy about that 😅 so I tried to work with the social worker and tried to contact the only person I could think of to stay with. My cousin. She's always been there for me, always been supportive of me. Pretty sure my mum got to her like she did the rest of my family because she has blocked me. I have no family I can go to anymore. I'm 16 and homeless. I didn't think my mum would go this far but there ya go I guess? I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no options. I feel like I'm screwed. I knew social services getting involved again was gonna be bad and here we are. I just wanna cry"
"(Tw: Rant)

I have never had the best relationship with my dad. Growing up, he would beat me whenever I stepped out of line. For most of my life I would never get even a temporary escape from him as he was unemployed until I turned 16. So every day after school I'd have to stay with him. Some days he'd say he had meetings or job interviews and then just go cheat on my mom with some random on tinder. So as you can see, I don't really like him much. He's beat me less considering the fact that he had child protective services called on him by an old therapist I used to have for pulling my hair and slapping me around. Since then, he doesn't really hit me as hard as he used to or as frequently.

 Growing up, he'd force me to do fencing, a swordsman sport you probably see in the Olympics. I've never liked it much outside of doing it recreationally at my high school but as of last year he's forced me to take it more seriously and go to national competitions. Last year I went to an annual competition and did pretty terrible. My asthma kicked in and I felt like I was dying as soon as I got out there. My dad swore never to invest in me again as the expenses for that tournament were far more than we could afford but here we are again and in three days from now I’ll be competing in the same tournament in Ohio. I’m literally sick to my stomach. I begged him not to waste his money on this because I know I’ll do poorly but he didn’t listen he just yelled at me for not being positive. But how can you be positive when you lived in such a negative household your whole life?

I’m so scared to to be left alone with my dad Wednesday through Friday (competition time). Normally I’d text my boyfriend (that my dad doesn’t know about) to cheer me up but I don’t really want to tell him about my dad and our problems.

 I have a 3.6 GPA UW and my dad thinks if I preform well in this colleges will be more eager to accept me. But I know myself and I know my my limits and I know I won’t do well. I know a beating is waiting for me the day I get eliminated from the tournament. I’m so scared."
"balders gate 3 really highlighted this for me lol (I didn't buy it, it was gifted) 



Does anyone else feel the same way? We're dealing with near homeless atm and I'd rather chew my own foot of than to ask for any help. I just wish I had a parent that was helpful. Even just a little bit. "
"I am a girl living in India. A place where beating kids is seen as “appropriate “ and “discipline”. I have one of the most emotionally and physically abusive parents who are absolutely great at gaslighting you.

The thing about these parents are that they show even their basic duties as a gift. In fact, my dad says that beating me up is his right. My “parents” are these psychopathic people.

I once told my mom, (who is extremely judgemental btw) tht its ppl s choice to have sex before marriage and its ok whether they want or not. She got crazy and tried to touch and rape me to tell me how “dangerous” it is. Do uk when she tried to do it the first time? when i was 9. She was telling me how guys rape women and to make sure I understood she tried to “demonstrate” it. A mother is supposed to be a place of warmth and happiness but not for everyone in fact for some she causes horrors that leaves a lifetime impact. I hate my mom’s smell, looks, the way she talks and walks and everything, not because she is ugly or unattractive but because I detest the woman she is.

My dad is no better, he screams and yells at me and beats me up with a bat or a broom. He doesn’t have patience and is a pathetic cheater. What icks me off the most about him are not his beatings but his words. I can’t say those words for they have hurt me so much, so damn much. I hate how everyone thinks he is this “calm” and “intelligent” person when I am the only one who knows what he does and what a cheater he is.

My mom has a victim complex. Once there was this tuition teacher when I was 11 years old, she used to hit me a lot and always used to degrade me(I am not a dumb kid, I scored 96 percent in 10th recently). I guess because I already used to get beaten up at home, I couldn’t take any more of this. So I refused to go to that tuition and started crying. My mom dragged me out of the home to go to the tuition. Since I was just a 11 year old kid, I started crying. So my mom took me back to our house furious at me for crying in public. At home, she was so angry at me that she started yelling at me and telling me how she wanted me to die. All I could do was cry on the floor. But then she pounced on me and started pulling my hair so hard that I was sure I would die. I tried to push her off me because a grown 35 year old woman was trying to choke me to death. I swear that was the first time I saw death. My survival skills took over and I pushed her with all the strength a 11 yr old could muster but of course she was too heavy for me. So I pulled her hair back and when she loosened her grip a little, I escaped her hold. Then she called all her sisters,my cousins and my tuition teacher to tell them about how “I hit her and slapped her”. At 11, I was labelled as an abuser.  Then her sisters talked to me about how I was an abuser and that I should be handed over to police. I couldn’t understand what was going on and all I could do was cry. Suddenly the tuition teacher comes through our door, and I am sitting outside on our couch. She comes and slaps me hard on my face and I am shocked. Then she drags me to tuition where she makes me write a poem about how much I love my mother. At tuition, I was insulted and put forward as an example of what not to be in future. Then when I came back home, my dad said “if your parents are trying to kill you, its a blessing” and then I got beaten up by him.

So few days earlier, my mom was pulling this same thing and then she tore up my diary. I had been keeping this diary since I was sexually assaulted (another story) and tht diary had been my only consolation. Ever since that day, I am on edge and I hate myself."
hi I turned 18 last month and I graduated high school on the 20th of June how do I run away without too much drama happening and what do I need please this is dire
"from a young age everything was about them. their feelings. their hobbies. their passions. etc. this bled into my adolesence which basically caused me to have a lack of identity. everything was all about them. i had to defend myself against verbal ause, severe phsycial abuse everytime I tried to do something that prioritized myself. i was told that i was supposed to priortzie housework, cleaning, wathcing and babysistting my younger siblings before doing things for myself. when i refused i was beaten and called an evil selfish child. i was not allowed to do things for fun for myself i wasn't allowed because my mother and ather (despite making just under 200k a year) somehow 'couldn't afford' to pay for a baby sitter for us. so we had to be locked up in a closet for hours on end until my mother came home from work. no hobbies. no joy. no freedom. jsut depiration, neglect, beatings and constant verbal attacks. constantly being put down by my narc mother while my e-father sat there and watched while doing nothing (sometimes even joining in on the fun if he had energy). 

Didn't even let me go to bed at a decent time. nope. kept me up til 1 2 3 in the morning, beating me up. kept me up doing their fjpsidjijdc hosue chorsee constantly. cleaning the hosue in tip top shape eevery night jsut o be beaten up th enext morning for being tired. all i wanted to do was go to bed at a decent hour so I would have energy for school. but they would say i'm stuck up for wanting that. 

  
i hate them for what they did to me. how they continue to infantalize me yet put too much responsibility on me as a way to get me to do more work for them without asking for more. such horrible people. "
bro im so done w my dad hes been reallg horrible to me these past weeks like he fucking touched me he took my pants off and started touching me nd shit i js kept crying and couldn’t do shit he also has hit me more recently since ive been staying nights with him again kts js besn horrible 
"The fact that our parents abandoned and neglected my younger siblings and I to such an extent that we’re literally fighting to keep each other and ourselves alive as very young adults and teenagers is infuriating. 

Like literally fuck both of them. "
my dad did it in public in front of my friends. ffs 
"children are supposed to be loved. :( 
I've literally seen a mother threaten to slap her toddler in public by holding her so she couldn't move away and raising her hand as if she was going to hurt while nearly shouting at her    just because she was angry and couldn't control it as if they are supposed to be able to control how they act at that age."
""
"My parents seem to have a cycle of bullying me and threatening my safety, saying they will kick me out onto the street or saying they will take away all access to internet, and then trying to fawn over me and obsess over and coddle me. My dad will occassionally apologize and say that he overreacted, but within a few days they will find something else to shout at me about and say I am lazy and entitled and that they should kick me out because I am taking advantage of them. And the cycle repeats.

But every time, within hours of the event, they will act as if they never did anything. They will see me and smile and be offended if I don’t smile back. Every time I shut down around them, my dad says I am going into “autistic mode”. My mom plays the victim if I don’t want her to touch me and she says that she just wants connection. I tried to come out as queer with a new name to try and start over, but my mom gave me the silent treatment for days after. And then it’s like they forgot about that part of me and if I bring it up I am being unfair and threatening their emotional health.

When I ask why they won’t acknowledge my being queer, they either say it’s because their religion says it’s wrong, or mom says that my deadname is the name she gave me when I was born, and it is imortant to her (I am not allowed to change my middle name either). They say that both of them can’t think about me in any other way. If I talk about my mental health struggles at all, they say I obsess too much and I should just get a job and that I don’t work hard enough and have not suffered enough. I acknowledge everything would be better if I get a job, even though as much as I try I don’t even make interviews. My dad says that if I wanted a job I would have one by now.

I know they gaslight me. I know they are emotionally immature. I just don’t know how deep it goes in their perspective, and I don’t know if they are consciously aware of the pain they cause. That when I try to say I am suicidal, my mom gets triggered and she shouts at me (once said that my being suicidal makes her suicidal). She’s grabbed me and not let me get away. And she always seems to act before thinking, like if she’s emotional hurt she will remove all my access to family account connections like Amazon so I can’t use Amazon Prime shipping when needed.

I feel like I am insane because these parents give me top-tier iPads for Christmas and really expensive tech. But then they turn around and say they can take it away. I feel guilty for even thinking of how they treat me as abuse. My dad says my mom loves me so much and would do anything to protect me and feels so much pain for me. My dad has also said that if it was an ultimatum between me and my mom, he would always choose my mom. And then blames me if mom leaves late at night after an argument and says “we’re getting a divorce. This is what you wanted; are you happy?” (To be clear, I don’t want them to divorce. I don’t want to hurt them even by estranging myself from them.)

I don’t know how to reconcile any of this, the side of them that coddles me with the side that makes me afraid I will be homeless and without medication management support, that makes me feel so unsafe and struggling emotionally. I am 25 for reference, graduated from college as of December after almost seven years, but have a few disabilities that make it hard to even find work (I am using Vocational Rehab). So I am currently dependant on my parents. And suicidal depression makes it hard to even focus on getting a job when I am just trying to make sure I stay alive."
I thought my parents would change when I came out! As transgender! Female! At first they accepted but as I’ve been living here last few months particularly my dad’s behavior is getting worse! He’s been being extremely political lately which is part of the problem is he watches stuff on YouTube! I don’t agree with it! Apparently he sees me and my mom as slaves now we’re supposed to clean the house! And do everything he doesn’t want to do! He has kicked me out before for refusing to clean! I told my mom that if he did that I wouldn’t speak to ether of them again I would leave! He also said after I had decided to clean that he was going to raise my rent! Not to mention I currently feel fatigued and ill because I’m sort of sick! I’m at my literal breaking point rn! 
"For context he's been abusive my entire life, both physically and emotionally. On top of a *lot* of other sh-t in my current years. He's been also controlling my mom financially apparently and was really.. emotionally unstable. And now he's coming back soon after a couple of days, I'm not sure how to feel but my siblings seem excited to have him back soon. They don't know that he's abusive and think he's absolutely darling.. I don't want to tell my mom about this because she's stressed enough, a literal scar has been left from him leaving. He hurt her and I'm not sure I like the idea of him coming back, nor do I feel bad for him. But I don't think I can change it."
"So I've been coughing up white mucus and have been having shortness of breath and chest pain for the past two months

And today it got really bad, I couldn't breathe properly, I started feeling dizzy and faint. It took a lot of effort to keep myself straight, and I felt weak. I started crying because I thought I was dying. That this was my end. I seriously consitered jumping off my balcony so I wouldn't die of suffocation, that I could at least have a quick death.

My mom ignored me the whole time. She just kept taking her bath. She told me to go to bed, but I was afraid to go to sleep. I was very sure I wasn't going to wake up if I did. Eventually i started mumbling about how I was going to die, and I begged her to take me to the emergency room, I begge because i felt like I was going to fucking collapse. 

She started screaming at me, calling me a drama queen, saying I'm faking it and that I just want attenchion. That I was an attenchion-seeker. She grabbed me, shook me and eventually started hitting me. All while I contunied to beg to go to the damn doctor. 

She told me she hopes I die, that I'm such an attenchion-seeker and she was tired of me.


She kept hitting me everytime I coughed, but eventually she took me. She screamed the whole way about how she was a prisoner and that she can't have a life because of me.

 I'm 16, this is the only time she's taken me to one. I've had other issues, but she just yelled at me to shut up. And hit me untill I was to afraid to ask. That's why I never ask anymore, but I really couldn't breathe. It was either get hit and go or stay here and possible die

The entire appointment took 80 minuites.. she couldn't even take less then an hour and a half to take me to the doctor.

The emenergy room wasent sure what was wrong with me. My blood pressure was a little higher then it was supposed to be. And they kept suggesting asthma. 

They eventually just told me to go get an X-Ray, since they thought there might be something wrong with my lungs. They also have me some antibiotics and an inhaler. Well, they told my mom to go get them. And hasn't yet. I hope she does. I don't want to die next time I can't breathe. 

I have ADHD, so by law I'm required medicaid. She didn't have to pay for the appointment, it wasn't a money thing. She just didn't want to waste her time. 

I don't know, I'm tired of this all i think. 

She's always been like his, I kept getting ear infection as a younger child and it always took her months to take me, as I screamed in pain. 

She never took me to the dentist until I was 15 and finally called social services on her, and they made her take me. 

I think I might have some kind of PTSD or something since I'm constantly paranoid about my health. Since I know there's nothing I can do , worst comes to worse. 

I hope she gets my medication. I don't want to die."
"Please excuse any spelling errors I’m dyslexic 

I (16 ftm) believe my father (50 M) is watching me. 

Now I came here because 1: I’m not sure if this can be considered abuse. And 2: I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic.

Ever sense I was about 12-13 and it was known that I had started my period I’ve noticed that my father has perched himself outside of my door whenever he’s “suspicious”

If he comes into my room and notices that I’m laying in my bed doing absolutely anything at all, after he leaves I can clearly hear him outside my door standing there listening. 

If I turn on music on or move around he bursts in pretending to have forgotten something.
I caught him multiple times when I snuck over to my door and opened it as he was standing there listening, he would pretend that nothing was happening.

This has happened periodically sense I was young, once when I was 12 the same thing had happened but this time he made me keep my door open the rest of the day. Whenever I asked why nether him or my mother could make up any excuse and just said ‘because’

My family is vary religious, and that probably has something to do with his behavior but is it not weird that my father (only my father not not mother) would burst in at any chance at seeing something? He never has seen me doing absolutely anything and there’s no knock or warning. 

Am I being dramatic or is this weird??
Other odd things he’s done that seem unrelated are that when I was young 7-13yo he would slap my butt (in a teasing way but especially when I bent over). I always told him I didn’t like it but he continued until I was about 13 and stood my ground telling him to not do it anymore, he told me I was being dramatic but stoped.

Plus some other odd things. Again I don’t know if these are related or at all any concern, I get told by any family I tell that I’m being dramatic so maybe I am, what do you think?

"I don't think my parents were outright abusive, but I don't know where else to post this. Maybe they were neglectful in some aspects. I apologize in advance that is a very long post. I'm 16ftm, by the way.



My dad used to be an alcoholic, and would allow my siblings and I to watch really raunchy movies and the show BoJack Horseman when we were younger. I watched the 5th and 6th seasons of BoJack with my dad when they came out. I was 10. I also saw a lot of South Park when I was younger. One time my dad picked me up from a volleyball game told me he was ""fucking hammered."" My dad has made a lot of inappropriate sex jokes about my siblings and I. One time, he joked about my sister being a lesbian and having a large tongue. My dad asked me if I knew what masturbation was when I was in 7th grade. And he tells my family that it's funnier to add the words, ""in bed,"" to the end of fortune cookies, and I got a fortune cookie that said something like, ""It takes a long time to figure out what works,"" and my dad said that was true. My brother told me that olive oil was used as lube, because that's a mildly interesting history fact, and my dad overheard and said he tried it, and it didn't work very well. My parents have had sex in the same room as my siblings and I. It would happen in hotel rooms and the camper when we were camping, and my parents always thought we were all asleep, and I don't think my sisters have ever heard anything, but my brother and I have. Also, my parents' bedroom is right above mine, I don't want to be hearing them have sex. My dad has gotten extremely drunk and had some kind of breakdown. I'm not sure what to call it, but he yells at people. This has happened three times. The first time this happened was about 3 years ago. My family and I had just come from a basketball game, and we were trying to walk back to our car, but my dad kept walking off and talking about how he wanted to die. I cried, and my mom got mad at me for crying. When we got back to our car, my dad left again. My siblings and I went after him. We told him not kill himself, and a stranger told him that it gets better. My dad said thanks, and eventually we got back to the car and went home. The second time this happened was almost 2 years ago, on my sister's birthday. This is the only time this happened and my family was at home. My dad got drunk, and he started screaming at my mom about how he needed to find his phone, and how my mom needed to help him find it. She said no, and my dad took the van and drove off. I don't remember if this was before or after he left, but my dad told me to not cry and that it wasn't my problem. My dad crashed the side of the van into a tree, and now you can't open the right door of our van, because it has a really hard time closing. The third time this happened was about a year ago, and it was the most stressful. My family and I were going on a trip. We had to do a layover in Florida, and were going to spend the night there. My dad got drunk in the airport, and he called the hotel and kept asking for a shuttle. There was never a shuttle. My dad kept insisting there was a shuttle. The hotel was asking about the reservation, and asked for the code that was emailed to my dad. My dad started saying there wasn't a code, and I offered to take the phone and finish the call myself, but my dad said that would just make him angry. I started crying in the airport because he was being drunk and angry and I'm sensitive like that. My brother's girlfriend, who was with us, called over a taxi because she was fed up with my dad and we needed to get to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, it was a whole other situation. Apparently, we didn't have the money to pay for the hotel night. I'm fairly certain we did, and my dad just wasn't figuring it because he was extremely drunk. My dad started crying about going to jail because my dad was taking care of his dad and Adult Protective Services were charging him because he wasn't taking care of my grandpa well. My dad was yelling about how he was going back to America, and my sister told him that he was still in America, and my dad started yelling about something else. Then, my dad tried paying for our hotel rooms again, and started talking to the receptionist about how there wasn't a shuttle. I told my dad that it didn't matter at this point if there was a shuttle or not because we are at at the hotel now. My dad told me to, 'not fucking talk to him like that.' I started crying harder, and my mom was so fed up with it she paid for our hotel rooms herself, even though it was supposed to be a vacation paid by my dad. We had 3 rooms, one for me, my brother, and his then girlfriend, one for my sisters, and one for my parents. Anyway, we got the keys to our rooms. The receptionist was a very nice person who didn't speak a lot of English, and my brother and I apologized to him profusely. The receptionist gave my brother and I 2 free bottled waters, and told us to have a good night. I was still crying, and I told him to have a good night too. I actually think about him sometimes, because he was so patient with my dad even though my dad was being horrible. In the hotel room, my brother, his then girlfriend, and I were just trying to distract ourselves with the internet. No one could fall asleep. Eventually, my mom came into the hotel room, and thanked me for telling my dad he was being shitty. She told me she couldn't do it anymore and that she had to go tell him that she loved him and that he's not a bad person. I feel so bad for my mom because I know this has happened to her a lot more than it's happened to the rest of my family. In the morning, my dad said he was sorry ""from the bottom of his heart"" and one of my sisters said she forgave him. I didn't. That's not okay. Also, my dad got drunk in a hotel a few years ago and threw his phone on the floor so hard it broke because he got mad about Door Dash not working. My siblings and I still joke about that one, because that was really stupid. Any time my dad drinks now he gets physically sick, so he can't drink anymore.



My parents starting dating when my mom was 16 and my dad was 31. My dad was my mom's debate coach, and my mom became a high school dropout when she was 17 to go live with him, and they got married when my mom was 19. I didn't know how my parents met until I was about 12, and I only learned because my brother told me. I did think my parents' age gap was weird, though. I once made a joke about underage drinking in front of my mom, and she said she only underage drank when my dad gave her alcohol. I overheard my parents talking a few weeks ago, and it was interesting. My mom has been thinking about getting a divorce or going to marriage counseling for the last 6 months. My dad doesn't want to do either. My mom said she was in an inappropriate relationship with him when she was a child. I didn't hear what my dad said, but soon after he said he doesn't like the way my mom treats him. I was in the car with my dad a few weeks ago, and my dad told me how my mom has been talking to him more and more about their relationship, and my mom told my dad that she didn't think my dad is Catholic. No one in my family, except my mom, is religious. My dad has been lying to my mom their entire relationship about how he is Catholic. My dad actually got baptized as an adult, and told me about how ""fucking wasted"" he would get before those meetings. My dad told me that my mom wishes she had a good Catholic family, and how he never wanted anyone to go to church in the first place. I honestly wish my parents never started dating, because I believe they would both be happier if they never did.



My mom doesn't listen to anything anyone says. It's extremely infuriating. Recently, I had a big argument with her because our dryer was broken, and I asked her if she could call someone to get it fixed. She said no, and I asked why, but she just kept saying she wouldn't do it. I cried a lot about this because this was a problem that affected our entire family, and she wasn't doing anything about it. My brother fixed it, he's good with machines. A few years ago, I got into a really big argument with my mom because she kept putting bread in the freezer. I live in a family of 6. Putting bread in the freezer is doing nothing, and was only taking up freezer space. Apparently, I asked in a mean way or whatever because my mom said, ""I don't want to help you if you're freaking out."" I gave up trying to win that argument. I got into a lot of arguments with my mom when I was about 12 but I stopped trying to win them. I have learned that nothing I say to her will matter. I still have a poor relationship with my mom, but I don't care about fixing it. The rest of my family has similar issues with her. My dad's main issue with my mom is that they can't communicate and my mom not listening is part of that. My mom used to sign my siblings and I up for alter serving and mass readings without asking, and this would always bother us so much. About a year ago, my mom signed my sister for a mass reading and my sister was infuriated and called my mom a bitch. My sister ended up doing the reading, but my mom was really mad at my sister. Any time I get into an argument with my mom, one of my first thoughts is, 'I hate that goddamn woman.' This has happened multiple times, but I do not know if it is true. I can get along with my mom, but I would rather not talk to her. Everything she does bothers me in some way, which I think is unfair to her, and she is the only person in my life who I seriously dislike.



I started self harming at 12. The first time I ever cut myself, it was a few cuts, and I went into my living room to show my parents these ""weird cuts."" They didn't say anything or seem to care at all. I mainly self harmed on my legs for a few years. My brother got a girlfriend who self harmed, my brother was 16 and so was his girlfriend. When I was 14, my family was at my brother's girlfriend's house because our families were actually really close because our parents got along and all the kids were similar ages. Well, my brother's girlfriend cut her arm while we at their house. When we driving home, my mom told my siblings and I that if we ever wanted to hurt ourselves, we can always talk to her. I remember thinking, ""No. I've been doing this for 2 years, no."" When I was 15, my mom saw self harm cuts on my hands. She asked me if I ever did it anywhere else, and I lied and told her no. She told me that some people ""are into weird shit,"" and I just laughed awkwardly. I told her I wouldn't do it again. A few weeks later, one of my friends reported me to my school counselor for self harm. My counselor asked me if I wanted to tell my parents about my self harm, and I knew that it was required for them to tell my parents. I'm still mad at her for giving me an illusion of a choice even though I knew there was never one. So my parents told me they loved me and told me to not hurt myself again. I lied and said okay. My mom wanted me to go to therapy, so I went to a single online therapy session. I really, really did not want to go to therapy. I told my parents I didn't want to go to therapy again, and my dad defended me because he didn't want me to be ""put in a box."" My dad also has some weird beliefs about being medicated. My mom said that I didn't have to go to that therapist, but maybe I could try again in a few months. So, a few months later, about the same time I was I was supposed to go to another online therapy session, my parents saw more self harm cuts on my hands. My parents told me that when I'm hurting myself, I'm hurting them too. That's not helpful, assholes, don't make it about yourself. I said I was sorry but I refused the other therapy session. My dad kept defending me, and I didn't have to go.  Also, my mom told our extended family about my self harm, and never told me. I only know this because my grandma gave me a photo of Jesus holding someone like me and she told me it would help with my 'anxiety.' I hate that my mom told anything, I didn't even want her knowing. This was nearly 2 years ago. I accept now that I need therapy but I will not be asking for therapy while I am still living with my parents. I do not feel comfortable asking for it. I do not feel comfortable asking them for almost anything.



I'm trans and my parents don't do a great job of supporting me. I am fully socially transitioned, and have been out for over a year. All of my friends and people that I know (except extended family) use my correct name and pronouns. My dad uses my name in front of me, and I'm fairly certain he doesn't when talking to other people. My mom doesn't even try. She only thinks of me as her daughter, and nothing I do will ever change her mind. I came out to my parents twice, and both times it was over text. The first time it was really basic, and I told them my name and pronouns and I told them I loved them. The second time was a few weeks later, and I told them that I wanted them to start using my name and pronouns because I was hurt that they weren't trying. My dad said that he was using they/them for me, and my mom said we never got to talk about how I'm trans. I use he/him pronouns, and what is there to talk about? I'm trans. I'm your son. The end. I have a really hard time correcting people about anything, so I don't even try to correct my parents. It seriously hurts my feelings, but I'm not doing anything about it.



I have always had a really difficult time understanding math, even though I do fairly well in other subjects. One time in 3rd or 4th grade, my mom was 'helping' me with math homework, but all she did was call me stupid until I cried. My dad actually watched this happen and didn't say anything. When I was younger, around kindergarten age, my mom slapped me twice at different times. My dad asked me if my mom had ever hit me, and I told him no because I didn't want my parents to argue. Anytime the topic of child abuse is brought up, my mom asks my siblings and I if we are traumatized. My siblings and I never answer, but almost every time my parents are out of the house, my siblings and I talk about the annoying things our parents do. My dad has told me that his parents beat him, and I know he didn't have the greatest childhood. I know my mom had helicopter parents and grandma is still weird to be around. My grandma always thinks people are talking poorly about her and thinks everyone around her is ungrateful. She makes a lot of people in my family just straight up uncomfortable, especially my aunt. Also, my mom usually makes dinner, and always puts the food away after maybe 10 minutes. This has caused everyone in my family to eat really quickly, and any time I eat with other people I am always the first person to finish eating and it makes me so self conscious. My mom rushes everything. If something is brought to her attention, it needs to be taken care of immediately. If we need to go somewhere, she rushes everyone to the car as fast as possible and gets really passive aggressive really quickly. This is sometimes helpful, but most of the time it's just stressful. My parents do not listen to me when I talk about my interests. This hurts my feelings a lot because I really appreciate being listened to. I have very strong interests in certain topics, and I used to tell my parents about them all the time. I realized they do not listen to me when I was about 14, and this hurt my feelings very badly. It still does. When I was younger, my parents had this 'rule' that my siblings and I had to go to school unless we threw up. Like it didn't matter if we were sick unless we threw up. I believe they started this to deter my siblings and I from faking illness, but we weren't the kind of kids to do this in the first place. One time, in 5th grade, I really was sick. I don't remember all of my symptoms, but I had really bad headaches and was extremely exhausted for a week. But I never bothered telling my parents because I never threw up, and I knew they would make me go to school anyway. In 6th grade, I got sick. I really, really wanted to stay home. So I tried to force myself to throw up in order to stay home. I didn't have the puking kind of illness, but I was sick. My mom caught me trying to vomit, and got mad at me, but she let me stay home. I don't think she believed I was sick, but didn't care enough to force me to go to school. My parents thankfully haven't enforced this rule in over 4 years, and if I'm really adamant about not going to school, they don't make me. I don't overuse this, I skip about 3 days a school year. My parents argue a lot, by the way. It used to be a lot worse, but it's still not pleasant, but they haven't argued really badly in a few years because my dad seemingly gave up. Anyway, I prefer being around my dad than my mom by a lot. I do wish my parents were better. I wish I could tell them about my interests, and they would listen. I wish I could my parents that I had a hard day. I want them to be better, but I don't think I am ever getting that.



When I was 9-11 years old, and my brother was 11-13, he sexually abused me. I still feel really weird saying that, because I don't think it was actually that bad, but I do not know what else to call it. I'm not going into detail of what my brother did for this post, but rather what my parents did. Because the answer is nothing. My brother and I slept in the same basement, in the same bed for 2 years. I have no idea how our parents didn't think anything could be wrong. One time when I was 10, my brother took pictures of me shirtless. Well, my mom found them, and confronted me about it. I clearly did not take the pictures, and she was mad at me. She told me about how someone could use the photos for child porn, and she deleted the pictures, but I seriously have no idea how she didn't think about how I did not take them myself. During the last year of this, my brother and I slept in the attic together. Again, I have no idea how my parents never thought anything was wrong, but mostly I'm mad at my mom for not thinking anything was wrong when she found the pictures of me shirtless. 



Thank you very much for reading, I really do appreciate it. I just want to know if my parents could have been better. I don't think they ever wanted to be bad parents, but maybe they could have been there more for my siblings and I."

"I (16f) live with my family. I grew up with an emotionally abusive/neglective mom and a physically abusive little sister. Sometimes my mom would join in on the physical abuse but it was never anything serious until a year ago. I have past trauma of being sexually assaulted by my ex step dad 4 years ago and my mom keeps putting off therapy. About a year ago my mom started spanking me out of the blue. It wasn’t as punishment or anything, she just did it. I would be minding my own business and she would come up behind me and smack my butt. I’ve expressed how much this made me uncomfortable multiple times but she would pull the victim card and accuse me of calling her a pervert and how I hurt her feelings. She kept doing it and I had to bare with it. I was ok with dealing with it in silence until recently. About a week ago my mom smacked my butt again but this time I told her straight up that it makes me uncomfortable and I don’t appreciate her touching me like that. She just ignored me and complained about me to my now step dad. I thought she would stop after that but the VERY NEXT DAY she did it again. She never stops no matter how many times I’ve asked her to stop. She knows about how I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times starting back when I was 4 but she won’t stop. I don’t have the money to move out and I have no friends/family to stay with. What should I do? Any advice? "
"Hi, I'm a teenage girl and I have two older brothers and a single mom. Ever since I was little guys have come in and out of the house. Usually they are weird or sketchy, as in the do drugs, alcohol, criminal past, etc. This is due to my moms rough childhood past and her broken boy slection. She also has a rathelarge savior complex. She is also a crazy minopulator, so when the guys realize it they tend to get the he'll out, I don't blame them 

So basically my mom's new bf moved in with his little 6 year old. The 6 year old does have some behavior issues ex:lies, repeatedly asks for things, spoiled, annoying, screams a lot, but personally I don't consider them to be that bad. She has gone through her own personall trauma. However my mom (since she is licensed to work with kids) thinks she can fix her. She has been doing all sorts of disciplines which I believe have now gone too far 

Ex
Feeding her spicy Strachan when she misbehaves
Making her repeat 100 tomes that she's not in control
Spanking her multiple times rather hard
Making her weardiapers because she peed in the bed
Making her cut apart her own stuffed animals 
Making her do lots of exercises upstairs naked
Screaming and yelling at her

Would you consider this abuse? I personally am starting to, and I havenever seen my mom like this. I think she is taking her frustrations out on the girl. What should I do? My mom is a manipulator and at this point the bf is thinking of moving out."
"(I'm not gonna throw my whole story about my mom but to sum it up: Was going through the worst time of my life (I was 12) and became super depressed, ended up almost dying intentionally and she told me I was being dramatic when I revealed I tried, then babies my brothers, acts sexist, racist, homophobic, and always belittles and berates me, constantly says things and lies and manipulates. My worst example yet was I asked if my brother was okay when he was being taken to the hospital and they said yes, so I didn't worry and continued on with the week, only today to hear my mom telling everybody he almost died later, which freaked me out. I went to bed that night crying on the spot in the couch he was laying in, alone. Since I was alone those entire 2 days.)

So... little rant here. My mom can be nice, and gives great advice, but she also can be terrible. Like when I was 12 and she told me that everything happening to me was my fault and I'm too blame, to her getting mad at me for standing up for myself. And more recently, her looking at me and telling me ""looks like you need to get your but on the Peloton"". She's made me hate myself countless times, and is the main reason I can barely eat dairy, gluten, and sugar anymore, because she ignored me when I would cry in pain and tell her everyday I was hurting, until the point I almost had a stomach ulcer. It took me 8 whole years to convince my mom I wasn't faking being in pain, and now I'm finally better, however my stomach got heavily damaged and now I can't eat any of that really... Another great example was I was laying on the couch in pain and she came back home from going shopping and started yelling at me, causing me of just wanting to hang out in my iPad while I was laying there crying in pain. I didn't know why until she said ""oh it's cause you ate yogurt"" and I was confused, then she said ""oh yeah you're lactose intolerant""... I THINK YOURE SUPPOSED TO TELL YOUR KIDS WHAT THE ALLERGY AND INTOLHERENCE TESTING SAYS. Also she was the one who made it for me, knowing full well it would make me be in pain!

I have a great example here, I get hot flashes often since I'm going through puberty, and my mom got mad at me for wanting to wear (LOOSE) shorts in 7 Celsius. Keep in mind, I'M BORN AND RAISED IN CANADA. She told me to go put leggings on and I calmly explained that they were too hot and told her I checked the weather and everything, I also had a sweater because my legs were just really hot (in both ways, jk). She then started screaming at me, and told me if I wore shorts in this weather I would look like a ""freak and an attention whore"". Funniest part is. MY DAD WAS RIGHT BESIDE ME, WEARING A T-SHIRT AND SHORTS. I was more dressed than him! And my brother was wearing shorts too, shorter than mine! She also constantly tells me I need to start working out more and will squeeze my legs or my but as she says that, great, I'm going into highschool I don't need to be more self conscious. (And I am not overweight by any means, but then again I also don't know my weight since I'm not allowed to know, that's just what doctors have said in medical examinations).

Another thing that's pissing me off is my brother recently went to the hospital, which of course I feel terrible because he could've literally died, luckily it's just a condition (not serious or anything), no organ or brain damage so he's okay, he'll be back to normal in a couple of days. But because of this huge development my parents cancelled my entire birthday (which is 3 weeks away), which this is the one year I actually got one. See, every year for my birthday my mom would ask people to bring cans of food and then she'd donate it all, which is awesome! I love that, but as a 7 year old who really wanted a scooter, it sucked. And I wasn't allowed to have friend birthdays either, just family. I'm not mad about gifts or anything, I actually specifically told my entire family to not get me anything for my birthday because I don't like getting gifts, my ""birthday day"" was going to be my family actually spending the day with me. That's all I wanted. 

She also acts like I'm lesser in many ways, I'll voice a concern, such as me almost passing out and throwing up after using a tampon, and she'll tell me I'm being over dramatic. But the second she sees my brother even slightly sad, she legitimately went ""HES DEPRESSED""... I WAS LAYING IN BED STARING AT THE WALL WITH TEAR RUNNING DOWN MY FACE FOR WEEKS ON END AND YOU DID NOTHING. NOTHING. DON'T FUCKING TELL ME I DONT KNOW WHAT SUICIDAL DEPRESSION IS. 

Not to mention her obviously being sexist, and being okay with my great uncle gropping my butt (he is mentally challenged, I understand that, but she still makes me hug him whenever I see him which is alright I guess, just uncomfortable because he's very touchy...) 

She also gives me these rules: Work out 3 times a week, do all the laundrey, do all the dishes (I mean for EVERYONE for both those things), hang out with friends once a week, get A's in everything, 2 hours of homework every night, no wearing pajama's outside of your room, not allowed to mix two baggy clothes together, at least the pants or the shirt has to be tight, no spending any of your money (All of it goes into savings), and also maximum amount of gluten a day: 2 slices of bread, maximum amount of dairy: 1 fudgecicle, maximum amount of sugar: 1 popsicle, RARELY a couple chips. Also no soda at all, since it causes cancer, and not much meat, since it also causes cancer, and also nothing not natural, because it all causes cancer...

She also yells at me a lot, like she once yelled at me because I couldn't find her shoes and stayed screaming at me in anger, and I will ask her something like ""hey, can you help me with a projec-"" ""NO IM ALREADY STRESSED ENOUGH."" UGHHHH- ITS SO ANNOYING SOMETIMES. She rarely lets me finish sentences and tells me ""don't be negative"" when I tell her about this girl I don't like at school. I'll also tell her ""hey don't tell anyone this"", like some really private stuff, we're talking like stuff about my body too, and she'll go and tell everyone and then say ""I didn't know I'm sorry!""... AHHHHHH-

Sometimes I don't know what to think, she critiques me in every way possibly, I bring home a report card of all A+'s and she says ""good job"" and that's it, she hasn't even let me seen my own report card, she gets mad at me for not working out for 2 days straight and for eating junk food (a popsicle), and tbh I would go outside... but I don't have anyone to go with. I don't like the kids in my class, I've made that very clear, yet my mom continues to get mad at me for not being more social. I linked up today ""How To Get Outside More"" because I am trying to cut down my screen time, and all I saw was family activities... I didn't realize spending a whole day with your family in summer was normal. Like just, waking up, and going to the beach or something, or grabbing ice cream and talking, I didn't know that was normal. And now I'm starting to question everything..."
"Long Story Short, I Need Help. My Mother Has Been Emotionally And Vocally Abusive For A Large Portion Of My Life. I Think I Was Barely A Preteen When It Started, But My Memories Of The Early Incidents Are Hazy And I Don't Remember Exactly When She Began Targeting Me. I Know I Grew Up With Her Berating And Belittling Dad Whenever He Misunderstood Something Or Got Something Wrong, Or Sometimes For No Reason At All. She'd Scream At Him And Cuss Despite Her Children Being Right There.

She Still Does That, The Only Difference Is She Takes Her Frustrations Out On Me Too. She Especially Loves Targeting My Insecurities And My Health Conditions, Both Physical And Mental. She Accuses Me Of Faking My Tics For Attention, She Calls Me 'Lazy' And 'Ungrateful' Because My Depression And Arrhythmia Make Moving Around The House A Chore. She's Mocked My Sensory Issues On Facebook In Front Of Everyone And Called Me A 'Crybaby' Because I Hated The Texture Of Some Clothes She Bought Me. More Than Once, She Has Compared My Issues To Her Own R@pe Trauma, Saying I Should Be Grateful I Don't Have It As Bad. Gaslighting, Traumadumping, You Name It.

Now She's Even Tried To Throw Me Out Of The House Because I 'Refuse' To Get A Job Even Though My Unmedicated Depression, Anxiety, And Arrhythmia Make That Nearly Impossible. With The Arrhythmia Alone, I Often Have To Sit Down To Bathe Myself In The Shower Or Wash The Dishes Because My Heartbeat Skyrockets And I Might Pass Out Otherwise. I'm 24 Now And I Can't Call Child Protective Services Or Anyone To Help Me Escape, However I've Called Both The APS And The Police With Little Result. My Panic Attacks Have Gotten So Much More Frequent And I'm Constantly On Edge, Just Waiting For The Other Shoe To Drop And For Her To Blow Up On Me Again. I Can Barely Even Eat Anymore Because She's Always Around, I've Had Maybe Two Whole Bananas Split Across Three Unfinished Ones In Over A Week. Now My Heart Is Really Starting To Fight Back. My Boyfriend Has Recently Started A Fundraiser To Help Me Out Of My Situation If Anyone Is Willing To Spend Any Money Or Just Share The News. I Can PM The Link."
"(F 15) I was in the heat of a panic attack and I was asking my mom for reassurance that I’m okay and she starts screaming at me and almost hit me like 2 times and I asked her to stop yelling she said “how else am I supposed to make you listen this is how you make kids listen back in my day.” When I was crying and shaking and she knows I don’t go good with people yelling around me because of my dad and she said “how do you think I feel having to put up with your shit like this all the time” I can’t call anyone (like police wise) since if she goes to jail I’ll be stuck with dad and he’s not safe to be around due to addiction and if he gets arrested I’ll be basically homeless idk what to do this isn’t the first time something like this has happened this happens on an almost daily basis but I need others opinion on what this seems like because no one is listening to me irl.

"for context I'm 24, my little sister is 20, I haven't been in contact with my dad/stepmom for a little over 3 years, my sister texted me asking for help with computer questions and what started all of what's below this is me not replying to the questions they were making my sister ask me ...



My abusive/manipulative step-mom made a new phone number to text me again after a whole 3 years of not being in contact with them because of everything they've done to me, between abusing me, pointing knives at my neck, gaslighting me, manipulating me, etc ... they will not leave me alone and now I apparently cant talk to my own little sister when she asks me for help.

they have done everything under the sun to try and manipulate me or get my money which is not obviously not working, they've essentially conditioned my poor little sister into not even being able to function and I mean to the point where she's scared of using a microwave to heat up food (i wish I was joking)

they invited jerk into their house who was a previous abuser of mine and they treated jerk like a good family friend despite knowing what he's done to me (beating me, abusing me mentally/physically, implying several different ways to my mom that she should take her life, abusing my mom, not letting us go to the doctor when needed, etc)

I called my mom immediately after because these horrible people (my dad, stepmom and abusive ex stepdad) stress me out to the point where I pace back and forth and don't even realize it... I love my little sister but taking my ability to talk to her away is horrible, I'm stressed out and very anxious on top of that I'm going through a major depression episode currently and I don't know what to do or how to prevent them from not letting me talk to my sister, I'm worried they're going to make her block me and delete my number, I'm not in the same state as my sister either. I'm sorry that this is all over the place I just cant really focus right now."
"I’m just recently, at 29, coming to terms with the fact that my mom was abusive. She hasn’t really done most of it since a few years ago now for some reason, idk why. She still love bombs and makes me feel really guilty for not wanting to be around her. She has always love bombed but was also abusive and filled with hate. Maybe I’m just not remembering but as the middle kid, I don’t think she was like that with either of my brothers. I’m still the one most messed up in the head but I don’t know if she abused me because of that or if I’m like this because of the abuse. Was anyone else here the only one of your siblings that you remember or are being abused? If so, do you have any thoughts on it or anything? Thanks.

"At least five different people have seen her and concluded the mother has extreme envy but when questioned she even becomes violent and contemptuous towards the child mocking it showing malicious envy. When the child has something she wants she tries to get it for herself first and when the child does better than her she tries to destroy her to a level where she doesn't look as bad. She involves herself gratuitously with the child who she has betrayed in an issue with the father who therefore wants to cut off contact with her, but always to try to slander, mock and try to cut the child down and determine what she can and can't do. She refuses to see the child as an adult and when asked to either support her child or eff off she says she never wanted to be a mother. 

She then tries to misgender her child or say horrific things about her passing opinions she has no right to pass anymore given she economically abused the child out of the claim she didn't ever want to be a mother. Just sheer hate oozing off of her. 

Essentially she is raiding the daughter's life for parts as her mother, while trying to claim she never wanted to be a mother. Extreme malicious envy to the point of violence apparent.

What would you do? I've never seen someone this bad. It's really hard to be the child of someone like this who people actively can see is in malicious envy then denies it then denies ever wanting to be a mother while passing opinions when she shouldn't be involved but then claiming the mother card when she gets caught in involvement."
I’m a junior in college and haven’t been financially dependent on my step mom and dad for years and currently working 2 hours away in the middle of nowhere with barley no service which they know and two week prior was yelled at cause by my stepmom who said me and my girlfriend who have been traveling for 24hours btw said we had bed bugs which we didn’t ( my girlfriends dad is a pest technician) she was yelling at me and called me almost every name in the book and me and my girlfriend left my stepmom and Dads place immediately and haven’t been there for the past two weeks and not once have they reached out to apologize or anything but bills I have to  pay for stuff college and yesterday I was blow away by these texts she sent calling me butt hurt and that I need to get over myself I’m just exhausted of them and really don’t know what to say or what to do anymore this has been going on my whole life but now that I’m an adult I want to decide what relationship I want to have with my family?! 
"I’m 20 now still living with my mom, This is hard for me to write as I always suppress everything my mom has done to me and move it to the back of my head to the point I forget it. But today marks the final straw and I want to share my story. My mom has been mean to me for awhile now. She always yells at me for forgetting things when I have adhd and I have a memory problem. She tells me I have to have a gf that she accepts and the girl I’m with right now she doesn’t like just because she has tattoos and piercings but I love her to death. She acts 2 faced with people, says “ thank you honey” to her friends but when she’s alone with me she’s sometimes nice but she gets so mad easily. She blames me for her working so much, and she also has my bank account information and she sees my finances and also takes money out. I ask her why did you take money out? She says I needed it for bills don’t be penny nickel and dime with me I’m your mother.
She also tells me I have no controll in this house and no rights, she also tells me I am so close of getting kicked out. None of my family takes my side when I tell what she does because I thought it was a normal things mothers did. But she’s gotten worse. I’m 20 and I now have a cerfew, she hates that she now wants my location. She takes shit about me behind my back to her fucking 
Co workers she blamed me for going to another state for extra money and just todsy she got mad over me sleeping in. I don’t know still is this normal?

"My partner broke up with me a month ago in a severe mental health crisis. He’s currently hot and cold and caught between wanting me back and feeling scared of how he treated me during the break-up (he was verbally and emotionally abusive, that’s not typical).

I kind of knew throughout our relationship but have been really putting the pieces together that a lot of our issues have come down to his family accepting him back. Not just for me, but for the mental state he’s been in.

His family is generationally poor but ran into extreme wealth right before he was born. His entire life was planned for him before he was born but he turned out to be disabled and gay. He had a super tumultuous upbringing, was kicked out and spent his teen years homeless & in active addiction with his family turning a blind eye.

I have some family with money and their dynamic reminds me a lot of mine, it’s a very “we’ll give you reward money if you’re doing well but if you don’t meet expectations we’re not gonna help you, you have to help yourself” type of system.

A year ago, my boyfriend was given a check from his grandparents for the first time since he was 13. Shortly after he found out he has an inheritance. I started to notice a shift after this. He started denying his parents’ abuse and being self-critical in really intense ways that reflected his upbringing. This was obviously concerning me but I have been down that road before with my family being nicer to me and I know it’s just so hard when you just want family. I was really expecting this shift to kind of run its course.

When he’d go home without me almost every time he’d call me having a panic attack unsure of why. I’m honestly questioning now why I didn’t try to find a kind way of saying it, I was worried he’d get upset or start to break down. He wasn’t in therapy until very recently (was trying to get him in for 6 months before he made that step). I just know how jarring and unnerving it is to remember how bad things were and I didn’t want to push that work or let him go through it unsupported outside of the person telling him. He’d come back from these visits totally shaken up but denying it.

But something I didn’t quite realize the full extent to until recently is how much the ways he treated me were influenced by his family dynamics. He started to be ableist toward me (we’re both disabled), obsessive around money, I’m pretty sure he was playing a money game with me that I wasn’t aware of (in that I think he was expecting me to “hold up ends” on certain things without telling me because I make less than him). His behavior and treatment of me started to feel really off like I was missing something around the start of this year and honestly the only time I’ve seen something like this was from people with money having “expectations” they don’t tell you about.

And this is super opposite to who he is. He’s an anarchist, he’s struggled more with physical disability than I have, being bed-bound for long stretches of time and having to use mobility aids at certain points. At the start of our relationship, he lent me some money he told me he was more than comfortable giving me because I was struggling to pay rent. He actually insisted. He has continually upheld that he’s more than happy to. Through this break up, he’s told me if I’m ever struggling financially to let him know. But, sometimes when he’s mad he says things that are just a little bit off, feel like a little resentment.

And I’ve kept my concerns about family and the impact on him mostly to myself. If he ever outright denies his past I say “hold on, xyz happened.” And he kind of shrugs it off. He started calling his mom a lot before he broke up with me and both times he broke up with me, most of what he talked about was his career and financial success. I asked him one time to question if a specific thing his mom said aligned with what he wanted and he screamed “don’t talk about my mom like that.”

It’s just so tough. I’m the only person who’s seen this development and it’s getting to a really concerning point. His family’s inclusion of him again is supporting all of his biggest fears around financial insecurity tied to his homelessness trauma but it’s all conditional love. I think he feels afraid that he won’t be successful enough to be good in the eyes of his family. The shitty thing is my dad went down this road to an extreme and I know that even when you do everything you can, you’re just never enough. He’s pushing himself way past the point of burnout in terms of work and career success and he cut me off instead of the work. After telling me he was planning the opposite. But then he called his mom again.

I’m really scared for the day he realizes that he chose conditional love tied up in money by people who abused him over unconditional support and love from someone who holds him while he screams and cries, who encourages him to tell himself that he’s enough and to do self-work for himself and him alone, until he believes it.

He always tells me I give the best advice, that I’m the kindest and most patient person to him. He has other wonderful supports in his life that he doesn’t use. His mom gives advice that’s super questionable sometimes, all about success and sometimes she just says the meanest off-handed remarks when he’s trying so hard.

But even though I tried to stay out of the game and let it play itself out, it became me vs. them. And I’m worried. This isn’t about our relationship anymore it’s about the slippery slope for him, and the way he’s been treating himself.

I wrote some pages about my dad’s experience of embracing abusive family with money that honestly has so many parallels to him, just went way too far unnoticed for way too long. I can’t think of another way to express concern, I worry about talking to him directly with how it’s gone in small moments before, but I also question if I should express concern at all. I don’t want the whiplash of not trusting anyone, not right now. But his family are not good for him in this way. You can keep family but you have to keep them at a distance when they’ve hurt you like this. You have to question their advice. I had to. 

He does still trust me but there’s some broken trust, it’s hard to tell where he’s at, he started to have false memories about me and believe I was manipulating him (I honestly weirdly think it’s because I was always honest with him, he’s used to people lying).

We’re low contact until he stabilizes enough to hold a conversation with me, his extreme mental health episode is swinging the other way. He’s undiagnosed rn but the swinging has me having some ideas of what might be going on.

Do you wish someone had told you? Did someone tell you? How did they tell you? What do I do?"
"I have come to Reddit for the communities opinion. I am 15, and so is my now ex girlfriend. We met online, and she thought I was cute so we started dating. Through are relationship that lasted around few months, she had opened up to me about a few deep things. I feel bad sharing it, but I won’t say anything about her so her identity is still covered. Anyways, she had started telling me about her life. She has been raped multiple times, her mom was arrested because a bad boyfriend got her into drugs, etc. She opened up to me about one topic that truly stuck out and broke my heart, but now I’m wondering who is telling the truth. 

So my ex. She had told me about MANY occasions of her being abused. I have about 135 screenshots of messages from her telling me about the living hell her dad and stepmom have been putting her through. When she was 11, her dad threw her off her bed and threw her into a Barbie Dream House, and many occasions of her dad hitting her. Then her stepmom made it even worse. She told me that it started when the stepmoms younger son wouldn’t give my ex her stuff back, he grabbed her stuff, I believe makeup or her phone, and wouldn’t give it back, so she took it from him. She said she wasn’t aggressive, not like she threw him to the floor to get the item, but her stepmoms reaction was a 11 because of a situation that was max a 3. So she said after her stepmom saw her, then tackled her to the ground. My ex said she tried defending herself by throwing a metal cup at her, but it didn’t work. She said after her stepmom tackled her onto the tile floor, she started yanking her head back and forth, smashing her head against the floor. She said her stepmom was on top of her, and she was loosing chunks of hair because how she was pulling. She ended up with a concussion, went to the hospital, told the nurse, and since her stepmom acted nice, they didn’t believe her. When she told me that I was literally on the verge of suicide, and homicide because I was so upset. 

Anyways, please, tell me what I should do to help. I tried telling CPS multiple times, and do even got an adult to call and I called back later and told them who called and they just did nothing, my ex said she tried the police to, etc. I also believe it because someone from her school who she never talks to said she noticed some bruises, and when she got the concussion, she told everyone her and her friends had just been playing rough. 

Edit: It was all lies. She was a total liar 😐"

I stopped going to my dad's a few months ago because my step mom hit me one night Claiming I Threatened my brother now I live with my mom and sometimes see my dad and two younger siblings when we go to eat at a restaurant or something that are 5 and 3 I want to stay in there life's but how
I have a little brother that’s much younger than me and still living with my narc father. My father is emotionally and physically abusive to my mother. I grew up with a messed up perception of relationships. I would endure so much abuse. Since my brother is a male I’m worried he will grow up to be an abuser.
"I was verbally and physically abused by my dad from ages 5-10. My parents divorced when I was in 5th grade and he moved out that’s when it stopped. I am now 14 and he has entered a relationship with a new woman who has 2 younger kids 4 & 5. 

I can’t tell if I’m projecting my past experiences with him but the way he talks to the kids makes me anxious and uneasy. I don’t know if it’s just in my head or not but whenever he talks to them I hear an aggressive and impatient tone like the one he used to speak to me in. 

Has anybody else had the same feeling and am I valid for feeling like this?"
"It was a long time ago, probably back during the late 2000's-early 2010's when my father used to inflict physical abuse upon me. He eventually changed, however his behavior hasn't. He now inflicts verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse onto me. He calls me names, he yells at me, he yells swear words at me, he makes fun of my interests and ruins my day etc. And whenever I talk to him, it seems like he plays the victim and compares how his parents used to beat him despite the fact that he was born in the 80's and I was born in 2008. It's also not just towards me, but also to my sister and stepbrother. And he also does this when his wife (my stepmom) or any other adult is gone, and talks smack about them behind his back. I can't take this anymore, I don't want to be with him. What should I do? Especially since he often gaslights me into trusting him and how his wife and mother defend him. "
"I apologize if I seem a little scattered right now. This all happened today. For some background, I, (f 33) have been living on my own with my husband for about 5 months. Unfortunately, we moved to an apartment and I could only take two of my 3 cats. I opted to keep my oldest cat, Cinnamon, 16 ginger cat where he was the most familiar. He was very frail and wouldn't have tolerated being moved safely. 

Well, my mom asked me to come over to help take care of some paperwork. After she asks me, she goes basically oh yeah, Cinnamon has been missing for a few days and I haven't seen him. I went over today to look for him, and confirmed that she had not seen him in at least 2 days. We got into an argument over this, which I recorded. I will post the link here. 

TW heavy language, direct mention and innuendo of abuse. 

https://youtu.be/PmeIU7ryhj8?si=qpjDg_iKyxXbXC2w

After this argument, I searched to no avail and decided to get something to drink and eat at home, and for a chance to gather my feelings. I went and looked a total of three times. Each time confronting my mother about where my cat was, as well as the bubbling forces bottled up of all of the abuse I've experienced. 

Then, the third time I went over, I noticed what looked like a decomp stain on the carpet, in the exact shape of a cat, positioned in a 3/4th loaf, as a cat does, with its head touching the ground. The stain alone wasn't enough for me to confirm exactly. Something told me to check outside. I slowly waded through tall grass and jaggers on the property, as it's on an acre. There, I found a fresh, square shaped grave that appeared to have sunken since the ground was damp. My mother lied to me the whole time, and my cat was unfortunately already deceased.

"Not bothering with a throwaway because none of my family really use Reddit, and if they do I doubt they're in this sub.

My (M, 22) father (M, 68) is abusive as all hell. He hasn't been physically abusive since about two years ago (though the brunt of it was before I was 16), when he became too crippled to do much of anything. Now he sits on the couch all day listening to political youtubers loud enough for me to hear with headphones on from my room across the house.

Here's a list of stuff that he did in the span of 3 months.

* Emptied the bathroom trash can all over the floor because no one had taken it out yet during cleaning day.
* Cussed out my older sister (F, 24) when she called him out on that (He's always professed to be a Christian who hates strong language like that, this was the first time he had ever said ""fuck you"" to anyone in the house).
* Attempted to get me to physically fight him when I called him out on acting like a child, and then laughed when I told him he wasn't worth it.
* Told my sister that he wants everyone who supports trans people to go to Hell (this includes all 3 of his kids that still live with him, and he later tried to step back saying he didn't mean us).
* Mocked me when I tried to calmly give him Bible verses that preached against hate.
* Forced my mom (F, 43) to cut contact off with her cousin because he thinks she'll cheat on him with the guy (This is gonna get more context in the body of the post, because there is more information on this).
* Called my mother a whore after finding out she sold herself to make sure we could eat when we were toddlers, trying to gaslight her into thinking that he didn't refuse to deal with any family finances during that time.

Previously he's also ran off basically every one of his kids from his first marriage except for like, 2, including the one that I was actually close to.

I will give that his distrust of mom with her cousin does not come from out of nowhere. They were sexting (I know. It's disgusting. None of us approve), and he found out about a year and a half ago. However, he didn't ban her from talking to him then. He didn't do that until two weeks ago, after he had driven my sister out of the house because of how bad his behavior was, specifically because he said that he thought she was planning on leaving him too.

He has consistently reprimanded my mom for unfaithfulness, but all three of us were born while he was still married to his first wife, and this entire relationship only started because of an affair. He blames her for how long it took to get divorced when he was the one working at the time.

I want to get out of this house, but I'm only a substitute teacher right now, and there's very few career options at the moment. We only have one working car (two are broken down and one can only really go around town), so getting a job outside of town isn't possible yet. Additionally, I live in Florida, where housing is insanely expensive even above national averages because of how many people come down here to retire.

As stated earlier, my sister tried leaving, but she had no money saved up and got fired from the first job she got because her car wasn't clean (she got a job as a pizza delivery driver), and will likely need to come back here. I don't want to repeat the same mistake and leave when I have no money.

I don't have many IRL friends, and none of them live in this town except for my brother in law, who lives with us, so I don't have an out for now. Any ideas for how to get out of here? I'd need to basically leave the state in order to have a chance of affording a place."
"My mother has kicked me out twice before at 16 and 17 years old. She is about to do it again. I am 18 now and have 3 months until I move out for university.  

My mother has been mentally, emotionally and verbally abusive to me all my life. It used to be physical until one day at school as a kid, I told my homeroom teacher I didn't want to go home and explained why. The school kept me there until the police sorted out the issues with my mum and she has rarely touched me since. However, this has led to her getting worse in other ways.

My mother is disabled, I look after her and her many conditions have made her worsen each day; so it's thought in theory that I'm just her punching bag when other things in her life don't go well. She is verbally abusive to me everyday, I take notes of the things she says and does sometimes and even have PTSD moments recently of the things she has done to me.

Around the age of 16, I started standing up for myself, this would lead to me yelling with my mother, arguing with her and talking back. I only did this when I couldn't take her abusive talk and nature anymore. My mother is the type to say and do horrible things and never admit to them.

To explain the current situation:

- Yesterday my mother and I had an argument just because I wanted to ask a simple question. This was not rude, disrespectful or ill-mannered.  
- This resulted in her deciding she wants ""nothing to do with me, just wants me out of the house"". My mother left later that day and said she wants me out of the house or she's not coming home. When I didn't leave because I couldn't and would have nowhere to go, she called the police and they never turned up. She said she would not come home until I was gone.  
- My mother ended up coming home at midnight when she realised the police never came (she has cameras all over the house).  
- My father lives 2 hours away and cannot come get me because he has work during the day.  
- I was going to quit my job this week but last week my mother pressured me into staying at my job last week, which has now left me in a tough situation because she wants me out now, meaning I can't work.   
- My mother was going to pay for my studio where I'm living for university, I'm not sure if I'm still doing that.  
- I am currently learning to drive and she pays half of the lessons with my father doing the other half.

Today, I tried to talk to my mother and she said ""I have nothing to say to you, I just want you out of my house.""

I have no friend I could stay with, my godparents are all busy and my father cannot come and collect me.   
I have work tomorrow and I have an electrical key that she can deactivate. If I leave the house she may deactivate it and I will have nowhere to go. If anyone has any advice please help.

I may add extra to this because I feel like I'm missing a few things.

"My mother is abusive. I have two sisters, one is autistic. She constantly beats them up, especially the autistic one. She used to do that to me too, but I can fight back now. I did today. I hit my mother and I snatched my sister away from her. She ruined my room. I ruined everything. I can't run away yet, I'm not 18. Even if I do run away, I don't think I can take my sisters with me ince they're too young. I tried to run today but she blocked the door. I apologized just necause I have to but i don't think she's ever gonn ttrust me againt. I ruined everything. I cant escape. what shudl i do"
"My mother is an alcoholic and a narcissistic personality who struggles with accountability and ever since my brother died a year ago she’s been getting worst. 

From blacking out to calling me names randomly and even physically assaulting me and now I feel that she is exploiting me. 

My mom, stepdad and 3 sisters live in a Dc home. For context I am 21 and my sister’s are 23, 18 and 16. 

My mom has me paying her 500$ for rent for my room monthly although I have NO air conditioning or Circulating cold air. (everyone else in the house has an AC except me) We moved in a few months ago. I can’t open my windows for circulation because there are tens of flies outside my window constantly from the garbage cans in the back yard. The weather is 74 degrees outside and it is 4am (I woke up from the sweating) The humidity is exhausting and my room feels like it’s minimal 87 degrees. My room is the first room to heat up so quickly and harshly and it also gets the hottest in the house. 

Here’s the thing
When the summertime started I noticed everyone had a AC except for myself and my mother. (My mom had an AC at first but they broke it) One day I was in the basement looking for a fan and found a fan and an AC, The fan was clearly from the previous owners as it was full of dust so I had to clean it off with baby wipes and paper towels for usage, I also spotted a broken AC and decided to take it upstairs and fix it. 
I completely fixed the Ac and started using it until my mother came into my room two days later and noticed the AC and demanded that I give her back the AC that they had broken and left in the basement even if I fixed it to use now. So now I am constantly waking up because it feels like 100 degrees in my room and it gets so hot that it physically frustrates me. I regularly have to leave sometimes because it gives me a mental break down with how hot it is and how it makes me feel.

Why didn’t my step dad or mom buy a new one when theirs broke and why did he tell my mom to take my AC and leave me with nothing right after I fixed the AC and brought it to my room after they neglected it and threw it in the basement?! 

I know this will cause problems but I don’t know what to do and I cant afford to buy my own AC right now. 

For anyone that made it this far (thanks for reading) What should I do?"

"okay hi reddit, this is my first post and it's a lot, but i need advice. i just turned 18 this april and have graduated high school the month after, so i'm on my summer break right now before i start college and major in art to possibly become a ceramicist/ potter. i don't currently have a job right now (i'm trying to get one, no one's been hiring or accepting me so it's very hard atm), but i wanna save up money and move out from my abusive parents and family and live my own life, do whatever i want whenever i want and be with whoever i want. basically just be free and start a new chapter of my life!

my parents are very religious people (they're muslim and worship islam and allah, but i'm not), so it's hard to talk to them about certain things relating to my love life and sexuality (i'm bi and trans, but they don't know that). i'm gay and have a boyfriend, but they don't know that either (if they did, i would be homeless). another thing to mention is that my parents are also bosnian, so even more struggle!! :3 they're immigrants and came to america fleeing from the bosnian war that went on and they wanted to build us a life here, so here i am

they don't really let me go out a whole lot because they don't trust me with things from the past (for example, i missed some days at school bc i would skip, but i still went and finished), them catching me sneaking out of my window and house, the excuses and lies i would give them, and they constantly interrogate me and ask what i'm doing in my life. they're physically and mentally abusive and i've been having many hurtful, evil, and inhumane things said about me to my face from them along with some of my other siblings. they comment about my appearance, say that i'm not good enough and never will be, how i'll never meet anyone in life, how i won't be successful in the future, basically everything there is to say, they've said it to me. they've also said how they should've never gave birth to me and how it would've been better if i wasn't here, my own parents too!! unbelievable, but what can i possibly do about it lol (move tf out and leave them for good). my older sister (turning 24) moved from my parents bc they also found out that she had a boyfriend (at the time) and she didn't want this life, so i helped her take her things out her window and said my goodbyes. we still keep in contact and see each other today, but she started saving her money when she was 16, and i have some bad spending habits, but i've been getting better at it and been realizing my wants and needs. they've cut off contact completely and don't speak or see each other. she hasn't seen my parents in years, but they've known where she moved from and where she would go, which is really scary and super stalker-ish because idk why they care when she's an adult and has her own life with someone else???? super weird.. i don’t want my parents to find out where my boyfriend lives or where i’ve been going so they can camp out and stalk me (like they have before)

here's my situation:
recently, i had a fight with my younger sister and our childhood friend who we're really close with, and they've said many things about me and how they don't like the things i do (like smoking weed with my bf) and i've apologized for my mistakes and told them that i would be better from now on. they're not talking to me until they've seen that i've changed, i understand that, but what they don't understand is what my boyfriend is like (they've never met him or talked to him once) other than the stuff i tell them (the good and bad). my boyfriend and i have been facing some problems in our relationship recently, but we always find a way to thoroughly communicate with each other and try to see what we both need to do better so that we don't make the same mistake again in the future. i've been telling them about how i feel about the stuff he does (not mentioning bc it doesn't matter), but they think it's best for us to completely break up and they've been trying to separate us after we've been dating for over a year and this is the longest relationship i've ever had and the most happy and free i've ever felt from anyone else. they think that he's a bad influence and that i can meet someone else in college, but i don't wanna breakup and he doesn't either, it's just not happening. with that, my parents have been suspicious of me drinking or smoking weed because i went to the movies and took a couple edibles and they saw that i wasn't okay, when i felt like i could speak and walk fine (i don't have any weed or alcohol on me). the only time i smoke weed is when i'm with my boyfriend, and i'm not with him 24/7 every day, i can only hangout when both my parents are at work or go to a friends, and even then, i still sneak out and track where they are (i can see on my messages where they're at be you can send your location indefinitely, but have to delete it from their recently deleted so they don't know ur tracking them, you can track them but they can't track you). i've been a lot more safer recently, coming home before they do and been taking my car out sometimes because me and my boyfriend don't go on many dates, but started to more recently. they haven't caught me until my younger sister told my mom that i always go out, and she also started telling my dad in spite of anger when i’ve BEEN trying to gain their trust back and have been in good terms with them, no problems or suspicions until now. since then, my parents haven't trusted anything i said or where i tell them i'm going when i've texted, called, facetimed, sent own pictures to them and they STILL don't believe me all because of my younger sister who snitched. my relationship with her is over, she's told me how she feels and i told her how i feel, but she's so hardheaded and doesn't understand what my life is like and doesn't wanna be in it anymore, so i'll let her make that choice, but when i make a choice, everyone gets in my way of it for why??

when i was at my friends house with her, both of them went through my phone (which isn't okay AT ALL btw????? it's privacy and basic respect, why tf would you go through my phone when i wouldn't do that to you even if i was that upset?? lifelong childhood friend who i thought i could trust allowing this to happen btw) and were looking at the messages between me and my boyfriend and said how disappointed they were in me because they think that i drunk and drove the night of the movies, when i tried to explain to them that i didn't and they still didn't believe me. i went to his house later that day to try and talk about what we're gonna do (i came unannounced, he was confused), and they kept calling me along with my parents asking what i was doing and i almost got hit about three times because i was stressed while driving and told them that the number one cause for crashes/death when driving is texting and driving, not drugs or alcohol or lack of sleep, yes they can be contributors, but it's not the number one cause. i'm also not that dumb enough to drink and drive, i can kill myself and others and i know that, i don't know why they won't believe me when i've told them the truth about taking too many edibles and how i've apologized and said that I would quit completely (i'm gonna cut back a lot, but i'm not doing it or talking about it around them anymore, around anyone; my friends smoke too but idk why it's a problem when i do it, i’m only trusting myself bc they made me realize that, do not trust anyone no matter how much you love them or how long you’ve known them for because they will stab your back someday just like me. i’m still smoking weed and doing what i want, but barely than how much i was doing which wasn’t even a lot btw but sure, they think i’m some kind of crack head who has no money and looks for only weed in life when i don’t need it at all and can walk away from it, i just like how it makes me feel bc it’s relaxing and calming, the only time i don’t feel constant pressure and it’s MY decision, i don’t see a big deal with it when my same friend vapes nicotine and posts tiktok’s of her ghosting constantly when i don’t do that? in her car too but sure yeah i’m the high one driving “dangerously” when you’ve never been in the car with me and when you constantly vape and are with your boyfriend too). i know that they're worried for me and don’t want me to get hurt or get a dui and go to jail, but i've never drove high once and i've felt fine the whole time, i'm a really good driver and my boyfriend agrees, i took a driving class and know how to be safe on the road, i’m not an imbecile. after that, i turned back around and went home. my younger sister took my keys away from me, threw a water bottle and spilt it all over my face, yelling and crying and we had a talk later that night which she walked away from. she said she doesn't know what to do anymore and i told her the same thing, she wants me to go back to being the “old me”, but people change and i’ve changed, i love myself now more than ever, not the past version of myself. like people say, the past stays in the past, only focus on the present and future. people are so worried about the past and future, nobody really takes time to appreciate the present. just slow down and live life to its fullest, you’re not in a rush and don’t ever make yourself or anyone rush you. 

recent situation:
i was hanging out with my boyfriend this morning because we go to this store every tuesday with cheap stuff (they open at 8am, but the line starts forming around 6-7am), but i go to my boyfriends house before so i can see him and his dogs for a little bit before i leave. my mom starts calling me around 6:30am asking me where i was (she had to take my dad to work) and i told her i was at the store, but ofc she doesn't believe me and says that she's gonna go and see if i'm in there. i quickly rush out and start driving trying to beat her (he lives 15 min away from me, but about 25 away from the store) and i made it in line and she facetimes me, i answer and she asks me to show her and i showed her and she believed me. when i was about three away, she was six and it was really scary because i didn't want her to see me on the road. my bf met up with me later. my mom never came to see if i was there, but she came later before i left to give me money to put into my bank account bc i recently broke my phone and had to use my own money to pay for a new one, but they didn't know until a couple days before. she told me to go to the bank and go home after and that she would call my sister to make sure i was home at 9. i went to chick fil a to eat breakfast with my bf and then went to the bank and to a thrift store across from us. he left his car at chick fil a, so i thought i could drive him because i checked where my mom was at and it said that she was at work (she works at 10, this was around 9:30), but she was in the parking lot at the thrift store waiting for me and saw my boyfriend get out of my car!!! she called me and was yelling telling me to come over there and we had about a 10 minute talk in the parking lot about life and shit which i couldn't wait to get over. i was freaking out, we were both crying and she was telling me how she wanted to be nice and just have a good relationship with me, but i go out and do this stuff to her and ""make her sick."" (she had breast cancer last year, but is healthy now and blamed it on me saying that i ""caused it on her"" and if i'm trying to kill her) she asked if he was my boyfriend and why he was in my car, i told her that i didn't know him and he just asked me if he could have a ride because he didn't have a car on him and i said sure because i wanted to do something nice when no one else would and he had a foot injury (which he actually did). she said that she understands that, but i shouldn't take people in my car other than my sister (when i've been driving for over a year and have had my license since october but ok, 7 months of having my FULL license and i still can’t take anyone around but my little sister lmfaoo little do they know). she said that she was gonna go inside and take a picture of him to send my dad (he left before she went in there thank God, a guy he knew drove him back to his car and my mom didn't see him again, i think she was saying that to threaten me and that she didn't actually mean it bc i told her that she could go ahead lol it's not like it matters bc idk him anyways) and that he knows where i am at all times but doesn't wanna tell me, how if i wanna move to just tell them and leave, how she wants me to find a bosnian man and marry him (most of them suck and have the same morals like my parents and cheat a lot, and i already have someone in my life), and how if she saw me dating that man in public, she would rather see me in the ground on my deathbed than with him. yes you heard that right, my own mother who gave birth to me said that she would rather commit suicide than see her own child with a white american man. she said she would rather kill herself than see us two together, and when i heard that, it fucking broke everything in me. imagine hearing that from your mother?? looking right in her eyes too, she asked me if i was lying and to swear on her life that i wasn't seeing him, and i swore on her life and mine and i think she finally believed me, she kept saying how she feels like i'm just covering up making some kind of story because i'm beautiful and how i need to find someone in the future and she said okay, go home don't let this happen again.

after all of this, nobody likes me being with my boyfriend when he tries to be there for me when he can, but he knows how my parents are like and has apologized multiple times and wishes that i could live a normal life away from them and be with him and his family, but i can't because i have a younger sister and brother to take care of, and they wouldn't have anybody but themselves if i were to leave. everyone is dependent on me when i try so hard to be independent and live my own life without anyone getting in the way of it, but they still do no matter how hard i try. i'm getting so exhausted and drained for having to live my whole life in pure fear and survival, like when do i get to finally be happy and free and do what i want and come home and eat whenever i want, have my own job and be a tattoo artist, get an apprenticeship for that and actually start living my life? why do people constantly have to ""make"" these decisions for me when i know myself better than anyone else and what's good for me?? my parents think that all the stuff i like (rock, heavy metal, cowboys and westerns, music, 70s-90s, rap, clothes, piercings, tattoos) are all “satanic devil worshipping” things, even though it’s not, but they’re too dumb to realize. i can’t even wear a crop top without being called a slut before i leave the house in one hundred degree weather, but when someone with a smaller chest wears one, it’s fine because it’s socially accepted and normalized, but when i do it, it’s not okay and i’m called a slut for it???? it’s so unfair and i can’t keep getting mistreated and beat down in my young adulthood, my best years. i know that people are just trying to look out and want the best for me, but going about it this way is so toxic and makes me fall heavier on depression. everyone looking through my stuff, my mom finding my empty flask of liquor that i drank from long before, my cart, my sex toys, thongs, lingerie, all of it. even when i clean my room, she loves to dig for any secrets i’ve been keeping to find some reason to kick me out, have one less mouth to feed. i feel like nobody has been wanting me in their lives and feel like everything is my fault and that i'm the cause of it all, when everyone else is living their life with ""no problems"", or they're at least not thinking they did or caused anything onto me, when they’re at fault too and i’m waiting for an apology back. not to mention, but i had a year anniversary post on my insta, and they were texting saying how upset and betrayed they felt that i would choose him over them, even though it’s not true and i’ve said that.. i didn’t mean it to spite against them, and i can see how it might’ve come across that way; they thought i was ignoring them, but i didn’t wanna read their messages bc i had so much on my mind and wasn’t ready, and i apologized). 

i was originally planning to move out next summer so that i could get my first year of college done with and get used to my schedule and campus. i have my whole first year payed for, and i would be paying out of pocket for textbooks, meals, student loans, etc. in december, i have a month long break where i'll be working the whole time trying to save up. i could move that month/semester, but i wanna try and get my first year of school done so i know how things work and am more familiar. my dad, sister, and i had a long discussion about his plans for the future and he says that in four years, he's taking my mom and brother and moving back to bosnia (leaving me and my younger sister here, i'll be in my third year of college, my sister will be a freshman in college, and my brother will be a freshman in high school) and my dad said that he's willing to give my sister and i the house because he knows that apartments are really expensive and how it's dangerous living beside a bunch of strangers and how we were born and raised here, so he more than understands and will give it to us to decorate however we want and to do whatever we want. we'd have our own garage, backyard, pool, rooms, etc. that would be in 2028 or 2029, and i don't know if i can wait that long just to get a house with someone who i don't wanna live with just to get a year out of it paying for cheaper bills, there's just no point in making my parents wait when my sister wouldn't wanna live with me by then and my parents wanting to take the money from selling the house. if i go my first year at college and get financial aid and have my parents pay for the second year, i could move out that summer and they wouldn't even have to know. we're planning on going to bosnia next year i think? so that could be our last family trip together, i could probably have a car by then (my sister gets her full license in march/april, but idk if the title will be in my name bc i asked my dad about that and he said the only people who ask that question are people who wanna move out). i have a car, but it's in my dads name so it's technically his, but if i don't, i can get my own or drive my boyfriends car. i don't know the first step of moving out (if you have abusive, narcissistic, hypocritical parents like me) or understand anything about how much you should have saved up, what to look out for, getting your own car, transferring banks, transferring mail addresses, getting a credit card, getting a new phone plan, etc. any advice would help, should i move out this year or next year before things escalate and get worse? i can’t stay four years, i know it’s better financially, but i know that i can’t hold out that long with the past trauma i already have. i love my boyfriend so much and he wants to help me in every way to try and get me away from lifelong abuse and trauma. i know that i’m young and it might be too soon moving in with him, but i know that he would take the best care of me as i would do for him, and we’d have everything figured out and properly planned. even if we run along problems later down the way, we’ll figure it out together and we made a promise to stay together and not leave each other for someone else. as dumb as it is, i love him and would do anything for him, and he would do the same. i could move in with his parents for a while until we find our own place, or i could stay with his grandma or we can get an rv/trailer and live in there for a couple of months, maybe we can build our own  house in his backyard bc he has a smoke spot for himself, so i have options, i’ll have a roof above my head. i only have about $200 on me right now and i know it isn’t enough to move out, but i’m starting somewhere and i’ll have a thousand before (hopefully at least 3k) i move out since i’ll be getting a job soon. he has way more money than i have and comes from a supportive family, so if i told them my situation, they would understand and try to help me since i have a good relationship with them and they like me, they also have a family owned business and could get me a job right away (i’d get paid more than i have before with $10.25). my mom says that she’s gonna ask my dad to retrieve all my phone numbers and messages and ask who i’ve been texting and calling when idk if he can check my messages, but i know he can see my numbers. would he still be able to check my messages if my carrier is t-mobile, or are they saying that just to threaten me? if i changed my phone plan, would they be able to know like get notified or something? can they actually track my phone and see where i am at all times, or are they lying about that too? just another threat that i shouldn’t take seriously, or should i start taking them seriously? i know a lot of parents say that as a threat, but can’t actually do it, but my parents are very smart, so idk if they’re lying about that or not. my boyfriend and i have told people that we’re “breaking up” bc we know that’s what everyone wants, but we’re just taking a break from each other for a couple of months and keeping things on the down-low so that nobody suspects anything. we’re still gonna see each other sometimes, but the only difference is that i can’t have my own sister knowing because she could be the whole reason of why or if i get kicked out. i don't wanna get kicked out because of the man i love being with and the quick, harsh judgment from others, please help with anything you have"
"I'm going to tell what happened to me (33F) because I no longer wish to cover up for anyone: All my life I suffered verbal and physical abuse from my mother. She blamed me because, according to her, when I was born, her ex-husband ""showed his claws"" and began to mistreat her. I tried to help her the best I could, believing that once we were alone everything would be different. But it wasn't like that. She blamed me for making her report him and would get furious with me for no reason, saying I had promised her she would be happy without him. After a painful breakup with an abusive man similar to my mother, I decided I didn't want to live like that for the rest of my life. Then I met a man (30M) who seemed good. Knowing about the abuse, he proposed living with him...and his parents. His father kept to himself, but his mother was very intrusive. All our arguments were about her, never our relationship. One day, after an incident with his mother, he raised his fist at me while driving and accelerating a car that wasn't even his but his mother's. It was traumatic. He always said I had traumas because of my mother, but he generated that trauma in me. My heart broke because the man who was supposedly loving and protecting me had the intention to hurt me. The worst part is he blamed me for everything. He insists he's not violent, that I've pushed him to the limit. I'm still affected and cry every time I remember it. I'm no longer with him, I live with a friend and don't have the problems I had at his mother's house. I wasn't the problem. It's true I need to heal, but he has serious problems as well. I don´t want him back, I just want to heal to have a good relationship.

"Officially going no contact with my cheating narc father. I posted on another forum but I need all the advice I can get. I finally confronted him after years of him cheating on and emotionally and physically abusing my mother and his responses were “Sure. You had such a difficult childhood. I don’t know how you survived.” And “it’s none of your business” 
I just want to feel validated. Will he ever admit the truth? And why does he stay married to my mother when he clearly doesn’t love her?"
"Note: Im 19, mother 45 or smth, my older sister is 20, younger brother is 17  
  
I've been confused recently and it's just the situation I was placed under and how it is altering events. Recently I tried to commit due to my mother's outburst as she destroyed everything I had; including my clothes, my art, and my items within my room, this was all because of me being myself in dressing the way I wanted to. Note that in the past she has been aggressive and abusive including, starving me, calling me a wh\*re, or any other derogatory terms. She never loved me and always told me I was never part of this family. So I decided to do her a favor and remove myself permanently. I was on the verge of overdose and I tried my hardest to just pass out but I decided to talk to my counselor that I was going to commit leading me to the doctors trying to take the toxins out of me. When they were allowed to visit, no one came besides my aunt who was there and said if my mother did not accept me as her daughter she was always there. For the first time, I realized my mother never treated me like her own child like she treated her other two other children. My mother did eventually come but all she did was tell me that it was my fault for being here and she should've just talked it out when I had the chance and she was not really that mad. She only said that because she did not want to cause a huge fuss over what happened in front of everyone it was so fake; I believed it though cause I just wanted closure even if it was fake. I ended up going to the phyceward for a 51/50 stay but when I was gone it got worse my brothers noted that I called her a b\*tch for the longest time as if they never said told her that. When I was there she did try her hardest to get me out of that situation and put me on track because they were thinking about putting me there longer. Knowing that made me feel like she might be ok and accept me but when I got out I was ready to meet them all. It was like this wash of reality that I did not know them and it all seemed clear that it was just fake talk for a while to make me feel safe but in reality, it was not.   
She made it clear that I am not her daughter and I do not address her as a mother. She made me apologize to her about the lack of respect but not once did I hear her say sorry for the torture and abuse she put me through. She made me starve, beat me around till I bled, forced me to separate from my grandparents, and forced me to not have friends bc she was scared I would go around and tell. There is more to that list but those were the only things I wanted her to know that she did to me no she wants an apology for the circumstance she put me through and I needed a release of anger and took it out like that. She is no mother, she is some monster I deal with. Sure she may have given me all this but at what cost she did this to herself, and now I am turned out like this all at her expense.   
It's worse now, my siblings have separated from me because it's too much for them to handle when I talk about my mother and tell me to go get therapy. When I was in that phyceward they promised me it'd get better and be there for me. When I was out, they isolated me, shut the door off, and went out with their friends and did not even talk to me once because I had to learn a lesson. It's been harsh and I gave up on this entire family and already accepted that I am no longer part of this family. All I want is peace and be able to live freely, so im planning on leaving next year and never looking back at them. I've been lashing out in anger now at them and I don't know how to control it when I see them, they get me so annoyed and disgusted.

I've been putting guilt on for just existing but now I want to understand if my anger is justified now or am I being dramatic. Am I even allowed to give up on them or should I still try? My older sister is offering therapy but complains she needs to save up, I don't even know anymore, im so lost in what to do with this family and how to be a part of it if theirs even a chance. "
"Hi. I’m 20, non binary, and have struggled with anxiety, depression, and undiagnosed learning disorders for years. 
I moved out of my house to live with my boyfriend and it’s been wonderful. But right now I’m on a trip with my mother overseas.

I’m on the autism spectrum and my parents don’t believe me. Especially my mom. She constantly ignores me when I ask for accommodations such as staying home for a day or needing to go to the mental hospital (she refused to take me).

On this trip, I had about enough of this type of treatment. She yells at me all the time, treats me like I’m the worst thing to happen to her, threatens to slap me, calls me names such as a “shit ass child”, and I constantly have to be careful about what I say to her because I never know if she’s going to be angry with me. She yells at me when I slightly disagree with her or tell her I need help. I used to be afraid to get in her car for the fear of being yelled at. I could never tell how she was going to react. 

She disregards my feelings for her own. She said “parenting doesn’t come with an instruction manual”.

I finally snapped on this trip… I had 2 huge meltdowns and all my mom had to say to me was “this trip was expensive” and that “I’m ungrateful”. Which I’m not… I’m very thankful that I get to travel.. just not thankful that it’s with her. She said to me last night that she “doesn’t know who I am anymore” and “maybe it’s the medication but you’re not my daughter” (again I’m non binary and have told her this multiple times). I yelled at her last night telling her that she’s the reason I act like this. I couldn’t take it anymore and I just yelled and screamed and told her all of the shit she did that messed me up. I can’t remember a good portion of my childhood anymore. 

Now she’s upset and will most likely blame me for ruining the trip. All she had to say to me was “I’m sorry I ruined your life” and cried. And complained that she was sick.

I don’t know if I did the wrong thing or not. I feel bad but I don’t. I’m tired of being treated like my best is never good enough for her. 
My grades, my “attitude”, everything. I told her she needed to go to therapy because she has some unresolved issues she needs to take care of but she doesn’t think she does. 

AITA? Or was this bound to happen?"
Did that get to anyone else? My dad told me that after my mom was screaming at me all day and chasing me around shoving me like she would do all the time. I believed it for a while and it really drove in my depression farther but I’ve recently been thinking about it realized that my cat loves me plenty so it’s proven false now. I hope that someday a human could too but I know it still won’t happen if I can’t get past my mental issues. Has anyone else here been told that they’ll never be loved as much as their abusive mother does and had it get to them?
"I’m writing this because I need to know that I am not the only person who is living it, it’s hard for me to open up but I finally reached to this point where I need to hear others opinions, my dad left when I was very young, my mom developed a rare neurological condition that almost paralysed and killed her, there’s no cure for this illness, and it’s very progressive, that was 13 years Ago, ever since my dad left my mom needed financial support and the only way she was able to get it was through the help of her brother, a very controlling inconsiderate hurtful person who never let us live, throughout those 13 years my moms mental health was getting worse, she started abusing pills and smoking cigarettes in insane amounts, of course she was spending the money where it shouldn’t be spent, my dad lived with his parents and was secretly married, his family always pushed us away to a point where they actually cut us off completely, of course my dad never stood up for us (back then) so we were very much involved in my mothers family, because again  her illness is progressive, it got worse and worse recently, we spent the past 3 years of our life in hospitals and  ER,  saving her life because she has now multiple illnesses, of course our health was and still is neglected and our needs were never addressed, the focus was always on saving her life, she is very unhealthy doesn’t have a basic understanding about her illness and doesn’t chose what is best for it, she is that self destructive, she’s disabled and can’t be left on her own, me and my siblings put our lives education and future on hold to be able to save her, but her brother sees otherwise he keeps blaming us controlling us and holds us in to not do anything ever that would take us away from them, he knows that she is irresponsible but keeps feeding her self destruction and whenever it goes wrong we get abused for it, 13 years of inconsideration, 13 years of neglect and control. 13 years forced to take all of the responsibility 13 years of not even being able to express thoughts  or opinions because we grew up tip toeing intimidated and living under the mercy of people who don’t know logic, and so many other details, I’m so scared of traumas I will be finding out about later on , if I ever get the chance or the space to take care of myself…."
"I'm 26 and my mother was horrible in the sense she put herself and her children through immense stress and trauma for making bad decisions.   
I grew up listening to their fights with my step father, anxiously aware of when her attitude had change even slightly and spending the rest of the day having to deal wirh her and knowing she was going to blow up with me or my father and later with me.   
As you can imagine this is just the tip, they luckily never were physically abusive but I wish they had been instead of everything else they did.   
I'm a hermit, I have no social life, no hobbies, no life plan or goal, I began contemplating suicide from early adolescence and I lived life waiting to die because I just couldn't picture my life changing for the better.
With the years this issued have just compounded and my mother's attitude changed, she has ""read"" a lot of spirituality, of the soul, the ""journey"", the psychology of ""letting go of the hurt to grow stronger"" and a bunch of other shit, all basically leading up to now where she sends me video after video after tiktok after tiktok all about ""your parents did what they could but now you are older and you need to see they werent so bad and find a job""  all while avoiding the fact I'm fucked up in ways that make it impossible for me to just ""man up"" like she so pushes me to do.  
I've had fights with her for for a decade by now about this, I wish I could leave here that i could find a job, but i get panic attacks from just being in public spaces and simple arguments and discussions make me so weak that I start to tremble and sweat, but she never stops gaslighting me that ""everybody has anxiety they just deal with it and go to work"". 
I just wish I could say something to change this situation, if I could I'd live in s shoe box just to get away from his house."
I was trying to relax after how humid it was today at practice (cross country). I was just relaxing downstairs with the lights off. My dad came down to take pictures of my bed to sell it (they’re getting me a new one). So then dad turned on all the lights on. So when he left and I went to turn them back on my stepmom shouted from upstairs “Turn the lights back on stop being emo” and “Stop acting like your depression was as bad as it was” I’m really hurt by this but can’t cry because if I do I’m going to get a lecture.
"I have always been abused by my parents , physically , emotionnaly , and they would do horrible things to me , and i also have bullies at school . I struggle with many mental health problems now . I have a lot of dreams and goals in life , and i want to cut ties with them and with my family so that i can heal and build myself a beautiful life . Actually , i'm 13 years old and i'm planning to get into a college into a foreign country and distance myself from them . ( I don't know  if i'm overthinking)  But i'm really scared of them to say nasty things about me in social media or in tv  to affect my life ( even thought i would be in a different country ) , and i'm also scared of that to ruin my social life ( like would someone like to befriend a person that has cut ties with their own family and parents ? ) . I feel lonely , and i don't know if it would get better ."
"I'm a (20F) first-generation immigrant who grew up in the UK with South Asian parents. My upbringing was harsh, and I often wished for different parents. >!Between the ages of 5 and 8, my father would force me to memorize times tables, using tree branches to hit me when I made mistakes. !<I hid this abuse from my teachers because I feared the consequences at home and didn't want my parents taken away. My parents downplayed my feelings and discouraged me from making friends, claiming they hindered success, which in turn made it difficult to socialise.>!In high school, I struggled with my home life and contemplated suicide.!< Eventually, I pushed myself to make friends and become more confident. I love my younger sibling (12M) immensely but fell into the trap of acting as a third parent, being responsible for his school work and behaviour at a young age. At 18, I moved out to create a life for myself and set boundaries with my parents, but I now struggle with hyper-independence. Despite my efforts to please my parents, I always feel like it's never enough and that I am to blame when things go wrong. I visit my parents every few months to maintain a connection with my sibling, but their negativity takes a toll on me. Despite the trauma, I work in healthcare, providing rehab to mental health patients and find fulfillment in this. I have a supportive long-distance partner who helps me heal. However, he holds a negative view of my parents, which makes me feel guilty. I feel emotionally exhausted and traumatized at 20. I often vent to a close friend who understands, but we don't know how to find a solution. While I have received counselling in high school and learned to set boundaries, further therapy and medication don't appeal to me. I acknowledge that my parents have made mistakes, but I don't believe they can change. I struggle with showing and receiving affection from them and resent the fact that I had to mature too quickly. I want to move forward with strategies from others that have similar trauma in order to avoid feeling terrible whenever I see my parents. I want to break the cycle and have healthier relationships.

Thanks in advance <3"
My father has been abusive since the day i was born he would always tell me I'm a fucking pussy or im a retard and worthless. Hes not my actual father and when ever we where fighting he would bring up my dad and say maybe your dad will come back. The abuse only got worse the taller i got he would smack ne almost every other day backhanded for flicking his hat off or because i didint do anything i did most of the fucking house work he thinks all he has to do to be a good father and husband to me and my mom and the abuse to my mom was worse he shot at her he threw glass at me and her and cut her leg had to get 13 stiches one day he was about to hit my mom and i pulled out a knife he leaned up against it and said do it.

"I was raised in an upper middle class household. I never had to really worry about money when I was younger so I always felt I was blessed. Around 8th grade, my father began to show signs of mental health deterioration. He was an alcoholic and always in a terrible mood. He wasnt too physical with me unless it was for normal parental discipline but it was an ABSOLUTE PAIN to be around him. He would often fake punch me when I walk past him (like a fucking kid) and one time he got me on my nose and naturally I got mad at him and instead of apologizing or anything at all he yelled at me for yelling at him. I would rarely ever even attempt to talk to him on a daily basis because it would always end in him getting angry and staring angrily deep into my soul and trying to belittle me. The most annoying example is when I would try to give him advice. It was like a fucking sin for me to try to give this dude advice since I was a kid and he was an adult. It really pissed me off when it would smoke (he would smoke 2 packs of cigs a day) and then come inside and start kissing my dog. It made me stay away from my dog because then they would both end up wreaking of cigarette smoke. One time, I asked him if he could maybe wash his hand and rinse his mouth after smoking before touching the dog after (I worded it kindly with a positive tone and wasnt being confrontational) and he flipped out on me and made it such a big deal saying that it was disrespectful for me to tell him to change something he was doing.

This stuff got really bad during covid, but sort of in a different sense. My dad stopped antagonizing me. I think its because I had a pretty big growth spurt and I was putting on a decent amount of muscle so he couldnt intimidate me like he used to, so he basically stopped communicating with me all together. We lived in the same house for about two years straight without a full conversation (this was so fucking weird). I almost would have rather been yelled at than this. We would still see each other around the house but he would just stare me down without a word as almost as if he were trying to intimidate me. I would always try to avoid him around the house. Sometimes I would wake up and not go downstairs on weekends. to avoid him and just listen through my door and wait for him to leave or go somewhere. during covid I would either stay in my room or the basement for multiple days at a time only coming out for food and water. 

My parents got divorced literally right when I turned 18. I dont even care about the implications behind this, but this is when my real depression started. I was already riddled with anxiety (before the stuff with my dad) and that stuff just made it much worse, and then going to college on top of all of this had me in a terrible place. I thought about my relationship with my parents a lot during this time and started to think that I was the problem. I would rationalize my fathers actions thinking that he was just really depressed and upset that nobody was helping him with it thus causing him to resent his family. The sad part is that the only reason I even thought that maybe thats what he is going through, is because that is how I started to feel. I love my mother, but I also always resented her for never caring about my mental health. Ever since I was a little kid, I had these anxious tics where I would scrunch my face uncontrollably. My mother would always yell at me for this (my father surprisingly didnt care or even acknowledge this like ever). She was call it a bad habit that I needed to stop and I always wanted to tell her that I couldnt control it. I learned over time to not do it in public, but still, to this day (im 21 now and a rising senior in college) I do it when im alone sometimes. 

Now for the resolution of this long ass post, the mixing of memories. Once my father left (im 18 at the time and a freshmen in college), It was just my mom and my sister. I was super depressed and I remember I would either act out and be super bland and whenever I was home for breaks. I didn't realize this at the time but I believe I did this as a way to try to get my mom to acknowledge anything about my mental health. I started smoking weed in the house the summer after freshman year of college (this was a pretty strict house and I had never once EVER even so much as cursed out loud) so this FINALLY made her say something. But this kind of upset me even more because all she did was suggest I go to therapy. The thing is, my mother seems to care a lot about me at times. She makes sure I am fed well, she works her ass off to help pay the interest for my tuition, and cooks me nice meals every once in a while, and it makes me feel like such an asshole to resent her. I still love her so much, but I cant really tell if I am truly wrong for this. I didnt read this post over so I hope it even makes sense, also this is my first reddit post ever an I have never told anyone about my family life not even any of my closest friends. I didnt even talk to my mother about feelings immediately after the divorce and it was treated like any other day. I feel like im losing my mind sometimes keeping all this shit in. I feel like my friends wont take it seriously if I tell them. I mean, there are so many other kids who are beaten by their parents and have no money and I feel like shit when this stuff makes me depressed. Am I crazy?"
"To Give background I got a lease with my mother in a two bedroom apartment. When we first got it both of our names were required to be on the lease agreement. A year later I got into law school. I left late August and the lease was up in October. When that time rolled around she begged me to sign for another year so I did. I came back for Christmas break and everything was fine. When I came home for summer she moved someone into my room. This individuals name is not on the lease and is a ex felon. When I came home all of my stuff was gone through and multiple things were unaccounted for. Since being home my mother and I have been arguing most every night. I don’t like my stuff being touched, but that keeps happening. The individual is up at all hours keeping me awake. And when I get upset about it they both act like I am dramatic. Basically my mom says nothing and lets him run the house and do whatever he wants. I have started a job at the airport and have crazy hours and need my sleep but he will be up cooking steak at 4-5 in the morning. They are both great at playing the victim. Something that blew my mind was I was woken up and the grwn man had his mother come over and have my mother and I “Talk things out” I did not ask for this and did not say she can move this in, in my legal binding contract. She claims it’s to help her get on her feet with finances but she does not work all but two days a month. I feel disrespected and uncomfortable in my own house. I don’t know what to do they are good at making me seem crazy. In their minds I should work crazy hours. while they sit around all day and all night, and do whatever they want ( including dealing with a smell of a strong burning substance that filtrates through the whole house)and I should keep my mouth shut. My food and drinks are also always being taken and eaten my car was also stolen a few days after coming home so I have been working hard to get myself another car so money is tight right now now. Again I don’t know what to do I’m trapped until August. I also don’t think it is healthy to continue a relationship with my mother because not only has this situation put a strain on my relationship with her. I have caught signs of drugs. She has put me in a situation that I don’t think any mother should do. She has defended him and sided with him. She has put me in a situation where if the complex finds out I can be in some serious trouble but she doesn’t think about me but him first. She almost got us evicted from this apartment for refusing to work and pay rent. And I don’t think they would hesitate to kick all of us out if they found out. Which means I could not get an apartment to head back to law school. I think what she is doing is selfish and if she knew she could not afford it she should not have renewed this lease. I am constantly told by her to go to hell, to go fuck myself etc. any advice or comments are appreciated. Also I am starting to lose my temper. "
"I went no contact with my parents last year after my mother went on a tirade because she was jealous of other people in my life. There were good moments with my parents in my childhood, but also a lot of bad and scary moments. My mom is an alcoholic (most likely narcissistic or BPD) and my dad has anger issues/low emotions. My mom was obsessed with me. She would say she was jealous of boyfriends for being able to touch me, friends, etc. She has tried to blackmail me in the past. She kicked me out once because I told her I couldn’t come see her during my college finals. There was also an element of sexual abuse but I am trying to be vague so it’s not too obvious. 

My mom texted me again today asking me if there is any hope for our relationship. I think she desperately wants a relationship with me, but every time in the past that I’ve tried, it has ended badly. The second I set boundaries, she loses it and claims I “can’t hold things from the past against her.” My heart breaks to know she is hurting. I don’t want that and I think everyday about the pain. It’s the last thing I want. But I do not think it is healthy for me to be around her. Being around her puts me on edge. My nervous system still reacts to her as it did when I was a child/undergoing the abuse. I’m so much happier and healthier the last year of my life and the only thing that changed was removing them. 

Has anyone ever reconciled and it actually worked? How did you know you were ready?"
"I left the house hold. I am free! But it still hurts. I thought the pain would go as soon as I left but it hurts worse now. I'm glad I am not in the fire but now it's like I am noticing the burns I didn't before. What do you guys do to cope? I am starting to get depressed again and it's scaring me cause last time I got depressed I couldn't sleep, I couldn't wake up, I couldn't eat, I was vomiting randomly, I had a seizure, I was self harming, I was unmotivated, I had constant headaches, I just felt horrible, I feel tired. I am starting to feel like that again. I always watched porn to make things better, to feel better, but I had gotten out of that cycle. I don't feel like I need it anymore... Except lately I have felt that way. It hurts. I don't want to hurt, this is why I left. I don't get it. I don't know what to do. It just hurts. It's getting worse because it got better? Does anyone understand this?"
"I'm beginning to realize some of this stuff isn't normal. The root seems to be my parent. I am a male in my teens and my parent is a good kind man, but he's often angry and says and does stuff sometimes that I now realize he shouldn't do. Somewhat unpredictable. For example I remember him giving my little brother a nosebleed by a punch or picking me up by the shirt and pinning me against the wall. He's also said some stuff like, we both are good at using charm to get what we want out of others. I didn't think to much of it at the time and other stuff like threatening to break legs or jab us in the throat. This stuff has made me a very apathetic and cold person causing me to hurt animals and sometimes people. Due to my very strong impulse.I know I am a terrible person I just need to put this here before I delete this account. I have parental controls on my phone so who knows what might happen. But back to the title. Sometimes my brothers, my dad, and me will joke about killing the dog my little sister loves by leaving her out in the street or just killing her in some other way. She is very sensitive and cares a lot about animals. I just realized that this is hurting her. And every time she complains about we all tell her to be quiet and stop being sensitive. I realize that this is a very evil thing to say now. I do not feel bad for this but I realize this is wrong. I know I am not a great brother. I don't need to be told this. I am honestly looking for some form of reassurance? I'm not sure. Am I lying to myself? This stuff is normal to me."
"I wish I was exaggerating, but yes. Today, years of breeding, propagating plants, and thousands of dollars has all gone to waste because my mom thought my room smelled bad. I owned 20 fish tanks all bigger than 10 gallons stocked with every type of fish you can imagine. I had recently gotten a new set of cory catfish for $200 from a breeder. My mom really didn't like them because of their whiskers so I think that fueled some of it. Today I went to school, and came home to empty fish tanks and some broken glass. I screamed, and ran to my mom asking her what happened. She told me she just cleared up my room for me and I should be thankful. All fish, including my 2 foot long catfish were flushed. My plants and coral  were thrown away and my fish tanks broken. No, I cant just start again because some fish are hybrids you wouldn't find anywhere else."
"I grew up with tons of abuse from both parents. They’re both awful people. I don’t hate them, but we haven’t spoken in three years and I don’t miss them one bit nor do I feel love or connection towards them. Is this normal? I look at my boyfriend and how he has an actual family that he loves and feels connected to. They fight sometimes, sure. But it’s different. My family just felt empty and lonely and like there was never love but rather just used each other for attention seeking. Is this normal? I feel like an outsider and don’t understand the concept of family even a little bit. "
"I'm new here and I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now. I grew up in an Asian household that took education and grades very seriously. I was punished or demeaned whenever I did something bought home a slightly lower grade, or perhaps did something that my mother wasn't very fond of (no matter how small) I open the fridge for a second, I get nagged at ""don't leave the fridge open, what the hell is wrong with you, you're adding to my already high electricity bill"" as an example. However, whenever I do accomplish something, I don't recall ever being praised for it. I've always been ignored whenever I did something my mother wanted me to accomplish. ""Get a job"", okay I got a job, but it's not enough because I'm not making enough money to her standards. I tried so hard to get a sense of recognition from her. She's told me several times to kill myself because I didn't want to go to college, or that I was a horrible useless person for choosing community college. She wanted me to go to a prestigious university. I worked my ass off at community college (took 61 credits and obtained my associate degree within a year) because she didn't want me to stay at community college. I ended up getting accepted to my dream school (also the school my mom wanted me to attend). I also applied and ended up getting a scholarship worth 165k, basically giving me a full ride scholarship to any university in the U.S., and guess what? No recognition, no congratulations, nothing. Just yeah that's expected of you. Despite the fact she insisted on me going to college in the first place. It just seems like nothing I do is enough to her, no matter what I do. I feel empty despite my successes in life. I still feel worthless and all that I've accomplished is done for nothing. She never showed up to my graduations either due to commitments to ""work"" because she needed money. I should feel happy for myself, I should feel grateful for all that I've accomplished, but no. I feel nothing, I feel empty, alone, and sad. I recently got a summer internship that pays 2k a week which would add up to a 100k annual salary, but it still means nothing to her. She doesn't care. 

TL;DR: No matter how much I accomplish, my mom doesn't and never will give a shit about anything I do. "
"My best friend, one of the people who's treated me the best and kindest of anyone I've ever known, who's always been there for me and who I have a very high opinion of, identifies as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns. I'd never had a nonbinary friend before, so at first I'd catch myself calling them ""he/him"" by accident, and I very occasionally still mess up now but I've gotten better about correcting myself. 

I see it as a respect thing. I was raised Christian conservative and was taught that using any pronouns outside of the ones you'd use for your assigned-at-birth gender is ""delusional and mentally ill behavior, not to mention anti-christian because Jesus made you the gender that you are."" I don't see it that way. If my friend feels happier being called they/them, then I think it's only right and respectful of me to call them by their preferred pronouns.

Well anytime I visit my parents, of course because I've adjusted to saying they/them and have been doing my best to avoid he/him, anytime I talk to or about my best friend, I refer to them by their preferred pronouns. My parents often will interrupt what I'm saying with ""You can just call him ""he/him"" here, you don't have to cater to his delusional bullsh*t here."" It makes me super annoyed and uncomfortable.

At this point I've stopped talking about my best friend as much as possible, because not only will my parents interrupt literally anytime I talk about them with ""he, (your friend) is a he."" But they both also want me to just dump my best friend over that ""issue."" My parents argue that my friend obviously isn't a very good Christian (obviously not 🤣 they're also an atheist) if ""he"" insists on me ""catering to his sinful delusions."" 

It's ridiculous. Obviously I'm not going to get rid of one of the kindest and most amazing people in my life, but I don't even know what I'm supposed to say to my parents when they tell me I should stop being friends with my friend other than ""no I'm not doing that,"" and the constant interruptions of ""he, your friend is a he,"" gets so irritating. 

The way my parents see it, my friend is a delusional anti-christ. The way I see it, my friend is important to me so if respecting and calling them by their chosen pronouns is important to them, then I see no reason why I shouldn't. 

I am also Christian, but I don't think or believe anywhere close to the way my parents do. I'd rather love thy neighbor, even thy non-christian neighbors, than spew the hate and disgusting behavior into the world that my parents do. My parents are the types of people who give us Christians a bad name and it's annoying. "
"I'm 18 almost 19 and my parents are emotionally abusive and manipulative with everything in my life. This includes how I dress and mh appearance in general. If there's something they don't like they will instantly start to yell and make it out to be such a big deal. It's become so bad that I feel mentally drained. They've told me that they treat me like shit because they feel like they've lost me as their child and have threatened on multiple occasions to kick me out. And things keep getting worse I'm currently trying to work 3 jobs to save up to move out but I don't know what to do. I feel stuck because they keep trying to control every part of my life and have also guilt tripped and threatened to disown me. They have also told me that all my life choices have always disappointed them and that I have never made a good choice even if it makes me happy. There have been points where they've even threatened to put down my dog.

Can someone please give me advice on how to deal with this? I am looking at moving out but rent is very expensive."
"So I come from a house where both my parents and 1of my siblings is abusive, my brother turned into a mini version of my father bur it cost him big time, it cost him his life... Might say it now, I am glad my abusive shithead brother is gone, I could have not care less.

Your dead arsehole and you did it to yourself. Why because he believed what my abusive parents believed, how because he did not have the balls to actually do something before it got worse. Do I give a shit... Nope.

So a little back story and hence the title of the post. So my brother R is dead. He pretty much killed himself using his diabetes, he lied to everyone about it. When did he died New years eve 2023. He would abuse his diabetes with not taking his meds, chugging litres upon litres of pepsi and his diet was terrible- he lived off junk food.

My husband and I offered to get him into a private clinic and away from my parents. He said no. He told everyone in our family that the doctors didn't know what was wrong with him, except they did and told him exactly how to fix the problem. Yea he didn't do it.

Now where do my abusive fucked up parents come into this and the title of thos post. My parents hate doctors. Hate and I mean hate will never see 1. My brother learnt that from them and did the same unless I dragged his arse there because his issue was driving everyone insane because he would make everyone's hell about it. So my brother was found dead in his bed.

My siblings and I get the call saying hey your brother was found dead this morning by your mother. Ok wow. So my oldest brother races to the house after being MIA for a while as like the rest if us got out when we could. He calls me later and the very 1st thing he says is what the fuck happened in that house! Now I am the only sibling that actually has anything to do with the 3 abusive fuckers and its because hey I want to make sure they weren't killing themselves- well too late for that, so I explained what I knew. 1 thing was he had been very unwell for 2 days and not 1 of those idiots called an ambulance! 

You left your son to die and now wonder why he's dead!! Fuck me my parents were stupid!!

Stay for part  2 of this shit I am now dealing with because you find out what killed him and why I wanted to kill him myself!!"
"im not rlly a redditor so sorry if the formatting on this is weird..but like the title says, i need help. im 17 years old, soon to be 18. the entirety of my life, ive dealt with multiple kinds of abuse- physical, sexual, you name it. this also includes cosca (both incesteous and non incestuous) stalking/harassment, public humiliation (caused by my mother) and just a whole long list of things that ive dealth with for years upon years.im autistic and have been very self aware from a young age (i was also always alone because i was homeschooled) and i made the decision a long time ago that i wanna leave. my mother created a bank account with me (pnc specifically) but has withheld the account information from me, so im not able to log into my OWN account. i want to create a new bank account when i turn 18, because im leaving and i want her to have 0 access to me or my money...but how do i go about this exactly?? i have my own personal information such as my social security, the actual card itself, and my id- but i dont know if thatll be enough for pnc to let me close my account without her there. what if they say she has to be present for the account to be closed?? what do i do then? and how could i possibly create a new bank account if i cant close the old one :( pls anybody who has an answer, help me!! i want to get out of here! i have a plan but thats one of the big things that im worried about- i dont want her taking all the money ive saved up! 

tldr; my abusive mother has access to my bank account since im a minor. how do i close the account when im 18 without her being present?"
"Don't know if this is the right place to say this, but I have a really shitty experience to write about here

From age literally 0 to.. I'm guessing around 12-13 years old (really cannot remember how, or when it stopped) my parents, specially my mom abused (is what I would interpret it as, on paper) me and my sibling. Nah, not a few slaps in the face twice a year, mom had mental health issues and serious stress and I guess, ended up taking out most of it on my sibling and I in the form of excessive ""scolding"". Get pissed off at everything, beating up, throwing stacks of books on us, and just, you can guess the rest. A little scary part is that I only have fragments of vivid memories from this period of time. And my dad? From what I can remember never even once tried to stop his wife from beating his kids. Just watched, silently, with a blank look on his face - still remember that look, although I dont neccesarily feel anything about it. Just, ah right, okay, thats how it is. Not disappointed, just.. okay. Fast forward - years later, probably by the time I was 13-14 none of my parents really hit me or anything anymore. I don't remember feeling relieved, I wasn't even doubtful or scared in the first place, because that was all I ever knew from my house hold. I realised that my parents actually grew to be kind, thoughtful and supportive people. Fuck, I don't know how to explain this. My mom would express guilt and apology to us as we were KIDS, as if that meant anything to us - we didn't even recognise it as abuse back then. Now when sometimes that comes to topic, my mom plays victim by basically bringing up how mentally she was struggling that time. That's fine, I won't protest because I don't want to discuss this ever with her. But I can't help but find myself in a rare state - mad that my parentss abused my sibling and I. Not because it left me with a permanent emotional scar, not because it damaged a fundamental period of growth in my life as a person, But because right now they look so happy. My dad, and my mom, they're so happy and in love right now. and its not like that doesn't make me smile, but on the back of my head I think like, so you guys can just seem so genuinely happy after comitting such sin? Just don't understand the guilt mechanism here, like how do yall live w yourself bruh thats crazy. Mom's always a victim because of how much health issues she has, I get it. Let it be so- but, I sometimes want to let them know whatever ""hapiness"" they have right now is not deserved. I'd normally say, deep down, I just want to talk to my parents about it and get myself a proper apology (I think they would) and get it over with. But no, not really. I don't want to talk, I don't want an apology, I don't want no heart-felt reconcile thing, I will forgive but it's too late to forget. Their abuse shaped me into something I hate to be, and while I deal with that they get to enjoy the rest of their lives next to the love of their life. How unfair, how unjust but that's how I tell myself it is what it is."
I recently got in a fight with my brother and my mom. My mom and i were arguing and she was yelling at me for failing to redo a assignment which i got a 80 in. We were both shouting and my brother came up to hit me for shouting at my mom. This has happened once before but i really deserved ut back then. He told me to take off ny glasses to slap me but i resisted so he took it off forcefully and started slapping me. I got so angry that i kicked back. This really made my brother mad and he started  punching me in my head my face and my body. I want to remind you that he is 21 and im 13. My brother is really a hypocrite and is pretty much the house dissapointment. He started choking me and i look over at my mom and shes not even feeling sad but she looked mad at me. I have calmed down in my room and im debaing wethere i should ask my school for help or i really dont know what to do.
"So my girlfriend's mother is very abusive and I dont know what to do. Her dad knows about this but hardly does anything about it. Both of her parents are very strict and our relationship is secretive. Multiple times her mother has said that she ""wished her dead"" and she tried to drown her in a bathtub. My girlfriend also has a heart condition and it gives her pain along with asthma so her mom exploits that by making her do exercises at night. Up until 3 months ago this her mother was perfectly normal and loving and just overnight her mother became a whole different person. Her dad and brother doesnt help her at all. I dont know what to do, she insists that she has it handled and wont let me call CPS or the cops. She also doesnt seek any help with this or talk to her therapist. Please help, i dont know what to do and im afraid that her mom might seriously injure or even kill her."
"For some context, I'm an adult (29F) who hasn't lived with my abusive dad since I entered my 20s. However, I still have to see him every few months for the usual holidays and every time it just fills me with dread.

My dad is not a good person but someone who is incredibly good at putting on the front of being caring and compassionate when it works in his favor. He has self admitted to doing incredibly nasty and awful behaviors in-order to manipulate people so he can keep them in his life and abuse them (without using the words manipulate or abuse, of course) but acts like any of the same behaviors directed at me are just simple overreactions or misunderstandings, so I know he is a compulsive liar on top of that. He has mentally, physically, and sexually abused multiple people at this point, including minors, and at one point I was so scared of him that I sincerely thought he would kill me, so I moved out and never went back to living with him.

But despite all of that, I have now distanced myself from him greatly and only see him a handful of times a year and I just can't bring myself to cut him off. There's a few reasons I suspect for this like: him making life harder for siblings, him attempting to stalk me, him trying to make my divorced mother's life harder, him threatening to commit suicide, or even actually committing suicide. But in any other situation like this... I would still highly encourage someone and probably would have already left without looking back. Why is it so insanely hard to do this with parents? Especially abusive ones we know just absolutely suck as people? Why do I have to worry so much about him retaliating... it feels like I'm playing house with an abuser and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about, especially know everything he's done up to this point.

If anyone here has cut off a parent like this, any input would be so greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being stuck in this loop with him. I want him so badly out of my life but feel so mortified at the idea of actually removing him and don't have a clue how to do it as safely as possible. I don't even introduce my partner to this man because I don't want them to ever even speak to him."
"24, and sometimes feel as if I'm stuck in my 18 year old self. React to things the same way, depressive mood swings, no trust in anyone older than me.  I despise them beyond words, but every day I'm fed the same bullshit of ""they didn't starve you, and you had an education, why are you complaining?'
I'm this close to leaving everything behind and working at an oil rig or something, even if my health makes it life threatening."
" I was using my hot glue gun last night, whenever I leave it or just put it down it's ALWAYS on a plate, not carpet, or wood, or fabric, or paper. I have exams today and tomorrow, so I have to study. I remembered and I panicked because I had to study, and I left the glue gun plugged in ON A PLATE. I guess I forgot, but I have a vivid memory of unplugging it last night. This morning I'm woken up to ""Wake up. Is that fucking glue gun on?"" I answered no since I remember unplugging it. ""Yes you did. You fucking liar-snake."" I was rolled over, not facing him so I said ""But I remember unplugging it?"" He goes quite for a second, I hear him unplug the glue gun, and then he fucking presses the metal tip of it into my back for around 3 seconds. Now I have this really bad burn, and it hurts alot. I don't know if i'll be able to focus during exams now, since the slightest thing wrong with my body runs through my brain and distracts me. Plus he took my hot glue gun. Even though that's gonna be my source of income for collage. (Selling stuff I make for around 20-50 dollars)

I don't understand, is this my fault? Does anyone else's parent(s) do this? What do I do?"
"So this situation is currently in motion and is being worked on and the end is near as I’m typing this so I should start from the beginning I guess so me (17m) and my (16f) gf started dating in February of this year (currently 2024) but starting talking in December of 2023 and back then I asked about her parents and always heard very little about them when the parents conversation was brought up but when we started dating she really opened up to me about her situation and I should add that currently it’s not just her in danger but it’s also her little brother (11m) that is living with this but anyway I don’t know where to start with just her dad alone (49m) so in late February when we were like two weeks into dating we were gonna tell them and then they found out anyway and he wasn’t that mad but questioned me about it obviously and I explained to him what our situation was that we only just started dating and I would like to meet him and her mother and discuss all of this which we did and all was fine UNTIL she started telling me that they both have called her a whore a bitch a slut and words like that and I’ve heard this first hand and they both have put there hands on her multiple times including slapping her choking her and kicking her into her room most of this stuff happened around the ages 6-11 and still continues today occasionally but she mostly is being called slurs consistently  and here comes the more disgusting and sexual abuse/tendencies part of this cluster fuck so in mid to late April we had a pregnancy scare and we tried to hide it because we knew they would kill us both but they ended up finding out and her dad as we expected lost his mind he started trashing the house and as soon as he found out he put his hands around her throat and called whore as usual and then the worst part comes up after he did that he then made her sit down and tell him exactly how we had sex  what position we did it in how long it lasted and if she had a orgasm or not and In the past she has had a series of different encounters with him involving stuff that seems to be a sexual manner such as her taking a shower and him walking in and ripping the curtain open and looking her up and down for several minutes she asked him for privacy and he told her no and I don’t know if this is worth anything but in march at the time I was in Georgia (I live in Arizona) I was visiting my sister as she just moved out and me and my gf were talking and she texted me pictures of her and the whole family in car and his phone connected to the car and started playing double penatration porn not to mention as I said the little brother (11) was in the car but thats just a little fraction in this shitcicle but recently she was allowed to spend time over here at my house and she got a call from her dad asking her what time she was coming home and she said probably around 9:30PM and he started saying that he doesn’t know his daughter anymore and she’s always out of the house and she’s no longer allowed over there (there being my house) and needs to be home no later then 9:30 so then I took her home and a few hours go by and then MY dad gets a text from her dad that was along the lines of you people are taking my daughter away from me  and turning her against me and manipulating her and encouraging her to run away and then my mom got really really mad at this situation and called him and I should add my girlfriend tells me and my family everything she really trusts us but anyway my mom called him out on all of this she called him out on the threats to separate us and the calling his daughter a whore  which he admitted too and said she deserves it and the abuse in the past and he spoke in a calm tone through out all of it while my mom was screaming at him and after that my gf has been looking into emancipation because she has self harm scars from this situation and and she has openly admitted she can’t do it anymore and is considering suicide or running away but here where some hope shines in my dad at his work has met a person who specializes in foster care/emancipation for kids and is helping us through this entire situation and we have told him about most of the stuff going on and he really believes we have a case but it goes way deeper than just emotional/physical and possible sexual abuse he did a background check on her dad and found he is a former felon and has currently multiple different alias and has a confirmed name change but also but that’s not even the start of it



For some reason I had to add a pole idk why

"For the record, if you live with your parents, rent seems fair. You live in the house, you pay for part of its upkeep and supply. My problem is stated above, but on top of that, she permanently raised my rent because my week was a blur and I forgot to pay. She acts as if I'm living in a real apartment  and gets huffy if I question it. I've been paying her $550(was once $500) in ""rent"" and $70 to $100 for ""utilities"" since March-ish of last year. What set off my alarm bells was seeing our electric and water bills and realizing my near-$600 could cover at least part of those bills. Also, our house itself is fully paid off. I hope I'm just being over-sensitive, but the whole thing feels fucky."
"When I was a kid, my dad used to abuse me alot. He was very strict on my education. Everytime I would make a small mistake he would threaten to ""break my bones"" by punching me so hard. As I grew older, he became worse. When I was 15,  I was so close to calling the cops on my dad since he was also hitting my mom. But I ended up not doing it becuz my mom would scare me about foster care and I did not want to be separated from my siblings. She even said that if we ever go to court, she will lie for my father and protect his identity. It made me so mad. After all these years my dad has gotten better. He had some character development. I am 20 now and I still have to live with my parents. The problem is my trauma is catching up to me and affecting me in my daily life. I always think I dont feel safe at home. I freeze up if my dad asks me something and I refuse to go to the living room if hes there. How do I get better? "
"I was taking out my kids friends for a fun afternoon (park, ice cream parlor) and when it came time to drop off said friend she refused to leave the car and insisted on coming home with us. I do know child comes from a home with issues but I never heard of a little kid not wanting to go home after a long tiring day.  The abusive must be so extreme she is terrified to go home. Eventually she agreed to leave the car after promised a bribe by a sibling.
What do I do? My mama heart is so sad for this little girl. "
"This happened on Father's Day this Sunday and I only got my phone back to talk about it. Anyways my little sistes hate me, so they try anything to get me in trouble. On Father's day I snapped at them for something, and then they went to tell my parents, but then my mom decided to escalate it, bringing up things from like 2+ years ago to prove that I'm a bad child. to My dad has a short temper, so he got mad and screamed at me and started to chase me down, he then pushed me down stairs and screamed that he's going to kill me over and over, I was curled up into a ball at the bottom of the stairs, crying saying if he wants to kill me, do it. My mom and grandma was trying to protect me, my mom was acting like an angel as if she didn't instigate the whole thing, she does this Everytime. He was hitting me so hard, that my mom made me run into he basement and lock the door. After everything cooled down, my mom comes into the basement asking me in a rude tone for my phone, saying I'm a bad child, and that my dad works 2 jobs for all my foolishness. Afterwards she kept on saying I'm bipolar and should go to an asylum. I hate this soo much, everyone blames me. And it was worse because when my dad was saying he wanted to kill me while I curled up, my little sisters were laughing and pointing. Now they keep on bringing up, mocking me. Sorry if this is worded wrong, my head still kinda hurts "
I'm panicking and want to talk to some pls

"to start- after what happened between us and the the type of person my mom is, it makes sense for her to get it covered up. i've recently come to terms that my mom is not my mom anymore. and as much as i should not give a fuck, i feel my inner child sobbing. 

to summon up our conflict, my mom was in an abusive relationship for 16 ongoing years. me and my three younger sisters had to witness and endure my stepdad's(younger sisters' father)abuse. when i got to an age where i was aware of what was going on and how wrong it was, i started standing up for my mom, my sisters and myself. long story short, my mom didnt like that and we spent the last four years on and off. 

during that time, my mom went actually crazy and instead of protecting us, became another abuser. she was my first fight(we've had four PHYSICAL fights). i've reported her three times to DCFS and the first two social workers absolutely horrid.

after my mom had fought my at the time, FIFTEEN year old sister as a FORTY FIVE year old grown ass woman, i called again with a verrrrry small sliver of hope and we hit the fucking jackpot. our social worker believed us and supported us with so much care. my grandparents now have temporary custody of my three younger sisters and my mom and my sisters' dad have scheduled and monitored meeting and talking times. 

it would take way too long for me to get into the detail of the abuse and the effects of it today. im just giving some background of why im here rn, ik that some may not believe me or see me as a spoiled ungrateful kid. i have to find the time and mindfulness to unpack those memories. im gone and keep yapping too much so im just going to say: believe me or not, i know what i went through. 

damn after all that i lowkey feel better lol. but ik im still gonna feel hurt over it. i dont want to just think abt the bad times to feel better, but to acknowledge and work on healing that part of myself. because im getting older, i want to grow and heal from the past and move forward in a different light. 

i just want to ask those who have been in similar situations: what are some ways you've helped heal your inner child?

"I could never punch a 4 year old
I could never call one stupid 
I could never cause the harm, trauma, and abuse you did. 

30 years old now - you told me I’d understand when I was older. I still don’t. "
"No. Everything wasn't ok at home. My attendance at school started getting bad. Teachers noticed. 
I was acting sadly at school even tho I tried not to. Counselor noticed. I was struggling with depression the pediatrician noticed. My mom denied it all. Denied anything was wrong. 


I was beaten ( ""punished"") for telling the Counselor the truth. 
I have no where to write this stuff. I have a therapist but it's not the same as writing.  It's not the same way of getting things out.

I am now 40 years old and behind in life. 
Possibly because all this. It's really tucked with my head. I've got this kick ass bf I don't want to lose. I hope my past doesn't ruin my future. 



Why though? Why is it so hard to say I was done wrong? And why do I have to feel guilty for it? "
"Mom: do you want dhr to take you away??!?!
Me:( only allowed to silently think inside my head) silently said to myself-why yes. Yes. I do. "
"The abuse has been more emotional for a while. More manipulating and my parents playing the victim.

It usually happens during arguments, which I have so much trouble with. I've been told, ""Stand up for yourself, don't let them manipulate you!"" But standing up for myself only leads to more trouble. 

My mom usually asks, ""How are my actions bad/how do they effect you?"" Sarcastically. And it frustrates me so much, because:

1- She's only going to deny that she did any of it/that it hurt me in any way (which, yeah, because you know EXACTLY what hurts me and what doesnt.)

2- How are you gonna treat someone bad and then act oblivious to what *you* did?

Anyways, im not sure if I should stand up for myself and make a *billionth* attempt to express how mentally damaging this all is for me, or just do what im doing now,  let them yell at me while just silently standing there. 

It just seems like theres no point. They never listen. But ""stand up for yourself"" is the only advice i ever get. "
I need someone to talk to 
"hear me out, i love this woman, but i can't stand her anymore. i love her for all the sacrifices she has made for me, i love her for paying for my education even when it wasn't easy for her. i appreciate every single thing she has done for me to get me to where I am today. what i don't understand is, why she thinks its okay for her to remind me of all she has done every time she does something wrong and i call her out for it. i had a very shitty childhood. her and my dad got divorced, got back together, and then got divorced again. every time i have an argument with her, she blames the divorce on me even though i had nothing to do with it. i'm 21 right now, i have developed severe social anxiety and often times i sink deep into really depressive thoughts because her and my dad dragged me into their fights ever since i was 8 or something. i saw everything, and i mean, EVERYTHING. things you shouldnt show a child even on a screen. they made me watch it, that shit traumatized me, i sometimes even had panic attacks cause i worried about them fighting so much that it made me feel sick. ofcourse it would've had some sort of lasting impact on me, its only natural. but now, she calls me names for just, simply being upset over something. she'll say things like ""she can't enjoy anything herself, so she wants to ruin it for others too"". ""look at her, its impossible for her to be happy"". they ruined annual holidays for me, cause the only memories I have from those holidays are of them fighting and screaming while the rest of my family celebrated downstairs but I was forced to sit and watch. no shit I'm depressed now, but I'm doing everything I can. I work a job I hate so i can help her with bills, but she doesn't see any of my efforts. idk why she does this to me.. its so exhausting, im sick of forgiving her over and over and over. i have tried every recipe in the book. i have tried talking to her, in all manners possible. its impossible for my words to reach her, no matter how many times i say them. she knows exactly what to say to me to hurt me, such as telling me that I ended up just like my father. i know its not black and white and shes not a bad person, but this one aspect of her is killing me every day, and idk how much longer I can hold on. i have never cared about what people say, but when something like this comes from your own mother, it hits different. she should be the one to understand why i turned out the way i did, better than anyone. the worst part is, everytime something like this happened, everytime she fought with my father, my brother ran away, and only came back when things calmed down. he always avoided everything while i was forced to make sure nothing escalated. naturally, he turned out confident, social and mixes well with people while I'm the opposite, which again, is something i get blamed for by my mother. a few days ago she told me how she's so glad that my brother didn't end up being damaged goods like his sister, that she's so glad she protected him, as if i wasn't worth protecting. when i asked her this, she said ""well its just your luck that you were born first, and a girl, its different for girls"" ??????????????????? idk anymore, i really dont, i feel like there's no point in anything, no point in trying, no point in holding on. i just want to kill myself so I don't have to deal with her words anymore. its not just her, my dad has a cycle of abuse as well, but there's only so much info I can fit into one post so for now i'll leave it. 



i can't afford therapy right now, and i don't have any friends who i can talk to, or any other figure in my life. this is why i'm posting this here, i'm sure many of the things people might suggest are things i've already done, but i just wanted to let this out in the world."
"I (36F high masking ASD) have a mother 75F who constantly verbally and emotionally abused my father 91F, silencing him, talking under his hearing level (he is mostly deaf), and basically everyone was treading on eggshells my entire childhood.  She also had a repetitive dialogue about the burden of men, that they never helpful and are useless and stupid, this affected my brother a lot. I clashed with her in my teens, but am aware that I (before and after adolescence) have learned to people please, keep the peace and try to be liked by everyone so I have social currency to change the atmosphere. Now in my own relationships I see the same behaviours and temper come out in me, I feel rage, resentment, loneliness and despair in my current relationship. He’s a great guy 36M, I’ve never been in love like this, and he is almost too patient… but he doesn’t work, he’s insecure and a little immature, and after 6 months of great mutual support I started to find myself belittling him, being quick to anger, snapping, not wanting to be touched/intimate and feeling frustrated. Its now a year in, it’s been getting worse and yesterday I asked him if he was falling out of love with me and he said he was scared of me. That shame really hit me hard, I’ve been pretty shut down since, suicidal thoughts at the forefront. He’s walking on eggshells and it broke me, my previous pattern and strong urge now is to break up with him to stop exposing ‘evil’ self to people and accept I can’t in good conscience let anyone get close to me. I’ve had a good amount of therapy, but I’m still not healed, I’m still repeating my mothers behaviour and I guess I’m hear to ask if there’s hope for me, or should I just give up on relationships altogether. 
Has anyone else had this experience, is there hope for me to manage this? Should I just leave to spare him?"

"it has been 2 years since i've lived with him full time and over a year since ive lived in a different city, im 21 now, but the way my adoptive dad (who i will b calling my step dad cuz i am uncomfortable calling him dad) has treated me in my teenage years still haunts me and causes me to be very short tempered with him, and has given me very unhealthy reactions to things, my biggest problem is he doesn't think he has ever done anything wrong enough to constitute an apology, i talked to him a little over a year ago and i said i was waiting for him to apologize for how he treated me when i was 14 -18 and he basically said he has nothing to be sorry for and while he has changed a lot in the last few years i don't rlly believe the progress has been enough to warrant me changing my views on him, for context he was raised super religious/strict, and is a bit of an unspoken alcoholic, and i was super addicted to weed and partied a fair amount in my teen years and i was angry, after he divorced my mom when i was 13 our relationship entirely changed, mostly because i saw how horrible verbally abusive and controlling he was to my mom and becuase i was a little shit, i definetly put up challenges and argued and was angry for reasons that were not my own, but the way his anger towards grew until i couldn't say a single thing without him assuming i meant it in a way to hurt and offend him, i remember so many instances where an offhand comment from me turned into him yelling and waving his hands above his head with me just trying not to react, and as i got older it just got worse, to hitting the walls or the steering wheel, driving eraticly out of anger, full on screaming like an animal, sometimes dropping to his knees and hitting his head (not hard enough to cause injury i think) and once throwing a chair across the room , all over arguments i don't even remember the subject off , and now he expects me to be a responsible grown up and respect him as if i don't start to sweat the moment anyone i love raises the voice or changed their tone, my mother was horribly abused as a child and sees my step dads actions as bad and immoral and unfair but not abusive and continues to encourage me to see him and mend a relationship but i don't think i can do it anymore, i went to see him father's day becuase i was in town and it was the same shit , acting like i have no right to my own opinion , lying to get his way about small things, i am tired of this but i also feel so much pity for this man with no one left , other then my little sister , his blood daughter and they get along wonderfully, which is definitely another confusing point for me, basically i want to know if you think i have a right to feel this way, if this sounds like abuse, because it's not like i didn't get harsh and bitter towards the end but i was a teenager probably on some drugs most of the time and he was a grown man , i am just so unsure how to go forward, i have tried demanding apologies but all i get is the same scoff and eye rolling and im tired of it but i don't want to call him abusive over things that happened years ago "
"It's always my fault, nothing I do is right. According to my family...

Me being bullied, my fault. Me being depressed and in a dark place, probably because I didn't do enough work. Me being sexually assaulted as a toddler, I probably encouraged the adult who did it. Me losing all my stuff, my dog, my money by my super abusive mother, I was clearly to privileged in my shitty apartment I can't even afford. 


No mater what I do, it always seems to be right for them. I'm always a disappointment to my family, but I don't have ANYONE else to turn to. Every one has abandoned me. I have nothing in life anymore, my parents took everything. I have no hope anymore "
"I've posted about this a LOT across various different subreddits, but I wanna go into more of the specifics in case anybody has any advice that could be helpful for me.  

I won't go into my mom's abusive specifically, or at least I'll try not too, but living here is horrible. She actively tries to sabotage friendships, my relationship, jobs, ways for me to leave, and more in probably not mentioning. I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack whenever I'm in the same room as her (my mom noticing my fear will cause me to be yelled at).  I've been looking desperately for any possible ways for me to escape this place (or for any way for me to secure housing if I get kicked out) and I... Really don't have many options.

I don't have the grades or money for college, I don't have a driver's license, I don't have a car, all of my devices EXCEPT for this backup phone were taken away, I don't have any family or friends I can live with when I leave, and we live in a VERY bad area in terms of rent/job opportunities. Cheap, shitty apartments are around a thousand, and I found ONE studio that's around 800 bucks, but it's in a very car dependent area, so that probably won't work.

I'm at a fucking loss. I BARELY understand what taxes are and how to do them, and I'm generally just not prepared for adult life. But I cannot live her any longer, I just fucking can't. Life is so scary and horrifying with my mom around, and if she finds out about this phone, I'm FUCKED.  

After hours of using AI to calculate prices, budgets, and other things that I understand very little of, as WELL as obsessively researching different towns and states to see where had decent rent prices, I actually found something promising. There's a town in my state that's not only VERY walkable, but also has somewhat decent rent prices. So honestly, my current plan is to just try to find a way to get there, and then find a cheap studio to live in.  Problem is, I don't have a car, and I don't even have a months worth of rent saved, and my mom probably won't allow me to get a job. She fucking loathes me, but is also TERRIFIED of me abandoning her (not to stigmatize cluster B stuff as ""the SPOOKY ABUSER DISORDER ooOOooOoh"", but I'm absolutely convinced she has borderline and narcissism).  

I'm planning to ask any classmates I can if they're looking for a temporary roommate when my senior year rolls around in a few months, but I'll probably be fresh out of luck. I'm autistic, and socializing is VERY hard for me. As well as that, due to somebody there sharing extremely personal information about me out of spite, a lot of people know about my old self harm habits, as well as other deeply uncomfortable things. They're kind of the ring-leader of the ""LGBT-group"" at my school, and because of that, I'm CONSTANTLY misgendered and dead named, even by OTHER fellow trans people. It feels so fucking awful, and basically no groups at my school will accept me due to us living in a very right wing area.  

I've considered just asking online on trans/autistic communities if anybody nearby is in need of a roommate but... First of all, safety lol. And secondly, I don't really know how. Most of these communities would probably remove my messages or outright ban me out of fear of me being a predator, and I doubt somebody who WOULD be looking for a roommate would settle for somebody who would have to be driven everywhere, as well as someone who probably wouldn't be able to pay rent for at least a month so they can job-hunt. Every day that passes, the risk of homelessness just gets scarier and scarier. I try to sound cool and composed while typing out a lot of these messages, but I'm... Really fucking scared.   

If anybody has any advice, or any OTHER communities that I could probably reach out to, please don't hesitate. Thanks for reading."
"(male 16 currently) I've been abused from the age of 7-16 both sexually / physically and mentally I've been consistently Rworded by people I don't know I've had my body seen by and touched by over 100+ people I've tried to leave this planet 3 times now and have been caught every time. 

At the age of 12, I had my first try at leaving this world by measures of hanging (this was the context of the story) my father pulled the rope away from my neck and brutally beat me he pulled out his unregistered firearm and proceeded to pistol whip me in the face 4 times then turns it on himself and proceed to aim it at himself (he was pretending to shoot himself) he puts the weapon back in his waistband and decided to violently have his way with me as he catches a glimpse of a tear streaming down my face me said “don't cry or ill give you something to cry about” (he has said this a lot of times before) then he decided to beat me until I stopped crying (he still had his junk out this whole time) he resumed his fun with me and proceeded to rip a chunk of my hair out (he was sexually assaulting me while he did it) he used me two times then left to go to work (he's a bodyguard 6’5 and pretty large has also served in the forces for 4 years) this event had happened again when I tried when I was 13.

(this is another story) me 15 I have a little brother now and must protect him with my life kind of mentality he's probably 1-2 at the time of the incident. My brother had spilt a drink over and my father was going to beat him badly I snatched him before and locked him in my room and I took the beating (he didn't hold back at all) he beat me with the dull side of a knife for about 10-12 minutes straight then proceeded to go get his taser and said If I scream or even cry he’ll kill me and nobody will ever find my body after the beating he stripped me and took me to a shopping centre and left me there naked and he told me I wasn't allowed home till he said so (I was on the street for 2 days) I was sexually assaulted for the day then thrown out in the middle of nowhere (4 hours away by car I was still naked btw) took me a long time to get home because it was night when I made it home and I quote my dad said this “where were you? We all missed you, didn't try to leave this world again did ya” this was around my breaking point.

I couldn't tell anyone because nobody would believe me because “boys don't get Rworded” i just wanted some comfort this is one of the not so bad stories (if my engilsh is bad it is because I’m self taught I have many other stories if you want to know about them just ask me<3"
"Hello! I'm 16 currently and I've sort of come to the realization that my parents are not behaving like how my friends parents act towards them and with each so please tell me if there's something wrong with me or with my parents 

OK so I'll start of by saying that my parents never and I mean NEVER got along honestly my sister asked them to get divorced but they refused because of how society may view them if that happens so due to this whenever My parents even sit together they fight their so sick of each other that they don't even wanna look at each other faces me and my siblings tried our best to maybe mend their relationship or make them atleast friends or stand each other for our family sake but they hold grudges against each other and they don't wants to forgive each other my dad (in the past) would go out for weeks and not return home whenever he fought with mom all I remember is me calling him messaging him and even recording videos and sending it to him begging him to come back he always did because he loved us but he hated my mom he would trow food down on the floor and trow all of her stuff out of their room etc my mom would never react to that and simply go somewhere else which was good so their fights never got bad to the point of my dad physically hurting her my mom tried her best by always trying to make dad happy to the point where she stopped paying any attention to us she was also working but then something rightfully snapped in her and she stopped trying to please him and rightfully fight back I always felt like I was walking on thin ice whenever I talked about dad around her (my dad moved to the upper side of the house but he was still living in the same house as mom at this point) and even when I tried to talk to her about a different subject she would always round it back and say ' your dad did this or that ' she would basically trama dump on us kids I love my mom but honestly I was a kid I didn't want to see my dad in a bad light I know he didn't love mom but he loved us so for our sake he tried to be more nicer to mom and change his way like leaving for weeks etc honestly he still hasent changed much but he's trying but at this point in time it was to late and my mom didint forgive him so my dad gave up as well and now both of them live in the same house pretending as if eachother don't exist so this is the back story for my parents and the possible reason they might be abusive but their behavior towards us is what I want u guys to evaluate for example my mom hitting and shoving us and screaming at us if we get in a argument with her and my dad is always saying to our relatives how toxic our house is which annoys my mom even more and he knows it also he keeps saying we are ungrateful and we don't love him etc etc when he's the one paying the bills and he also used to trow stuff like food my mom made near us and would vanish for weeks my mom keeps bringing and blaming my dad for everything whenever we argue with her like ""your dad didn't raise you right that's why your this way "" etc "
"My mom literally has control over my life, she can see and use my phone through her phone. She has been deleting everything, my emails, pictures even got into my discord. She has changed my passwords (even medical), and is in total control since I can't talk to anyone. Someone pls help"
"I've been out in my friends mother's care. Currently tryna sort shit out with my stuff and everything. My mum told my aunt that I have accused her husband of SA (which did happen) so now he has a pre warning about it and it also puts my safety at risk. She has also been committing tax fraud using my bank account for years so now I need to talk to my social worker so I don't get prosecuted in a couple years when I turn 18 for it. My mum is doing everything in her power to screw me over and honestly I think it's working. But hey, she's doing the same to herself too. This is fucking complicated and hard and I hate every part of it. Like most of my family is on my mum's side and it's pissing me off"
"Hi. I am a 23 year old male living in Australia. For the past 9 years or so, my father (who I live with) has been emotionally abusive. It started in 2015, when he blamed my mother for screwing up in raising us and threatened to take us all away and make us live with him (he was living in another state for work). From that point on, he became an incredibly volatile individual, and at one point, he threatened to throw a key at my mother's face because she told him that he was being reckless when pressuring us to cross the road in dangerous traffic.

He apologised the following day, but he still continued to be threatening at times, and one time physically threatened my sister because she was too obsessed with her phone. Just a week or so ago, he unleashed a barrage of verbal abuse at my brother (who struggles with depression), saying that he's pretty much worthless, has no job, and saying that when he looks at his brother, he is reminded of his failure as a father. He also shamed my brother for quitting his medical course and flying back to Australia - which my brother did because he had PTSD from contracting COVID and almost dying in Poland.

I've battled with depression for numerous years, and it's now reached a point where I feel absolutely suicidal. I want to get as far away as possible from my father, but I live with him, and have no means of financially supporting myself. I also don't want to abandon the rest of my family, including my brother, at such a tough time. I am also fearing retaliation from my father. But I simply feel I can no longer do this."

"Hello. This is my first time actually being able to reach out for help about this. I am 21 years old and my brother is 19 and we're pretty much being held hostage by our foster mom. We originally got placed with her in 2016 because my siblings and I were physically and mentally abused for years and even starved as punishment at our past home with my aunt and her boyfriend. I was also molested and raped by my aunts boyfriend and a dew of his male and female friends multiple times. We are genuinely thankful for everything our foster mom has done for us, without a doubt. But she is crazy, manipulative, and a narcissist. I know it sounds weird when I mention our ages. Any normal person would think ""dude youre 21! Just leave bro!"" But it's really not that simple. She holds every single possible advantage over us. She has our birth certificates and refuses to give them to us and we have no clue where she has them. We recently graduated high school this past month and she's actively avoiding going and getting it because she knows no matter what, we can't go. We don't have jobs, vehicles, money, or any way to get there whatsoever. We have no other family, we have no friends, we have no one but her. All she cares about is cleaning and that's it. It seems that she wants us to stay here ONLY to clean. I believe she's also scared of being lonely. Because she cheated on her girlfriend and she left. Her girlfriend was I'm our lives since 2011 and was pretty much a second mother to us. She was the balance that this household needed. And she left back in February 2023 and it's been living hell since. My stepmother doesn't care about anything but cleaning. She has no care for our physical, or mental well being. I'm not asking to be catered to like a baby, but at least give us our basic needs. Her only focus is cleaning. Her entire mood for the rest of the day depends on how good the house was cleaned from top to bottom. And note, we have 5 dogs that are barely trained. No one wanted these dogs but her and she doesn't want to take care of them, so we're forced to. Also her soon who is 26 years old also lives here and we are pretty much his servants. He doesn't have to do anything, not even things for himself. I'm surprised he can wipe his own ass. That's just how it's always been with him. When we first moved here we were told ""he doesnt have any chores because i want him to be a kid for a little bit longer."" He was around 18 at the time. And we were all under 13 cleaning the house top to bottom every single day. Cleaning has shifted from a common chore to our life amd it seems that's the way she wants it. And if it's not done to her standard (she has extreme OCD) she will spit threats at us left and right. She threatens to kick us to the curb, and she mentions about how she wishes she never brought us here, and that we don't work and that we're lazy BECAUSE we don't work. Mind, she won't let us. She refuses any sort of conversation about us getting jobs. It has turned to full blown arguments because of how bad she doesn't want us to work. She acts the way she does because she knows for a fact that if my dad was still around, he wouldn't allow it. He passed in 2019 after being in the hospital paralyzed from the waist down since 2008. He did everything he possibly could for us, genuinely a great man and we miss him so much that it hurts. She also blames us for his death. She has said to us countless times that it's our fault. Alo our mother isn't really in the picture, she surrendered us to our aunt back in 2009 because she simple could not afford to support us because she had just lost her job, and the house we were living in was too expensive for her because she work at walmart as a cake decorator or something like that. She did everything we could and I applaud her for that because I can't even imagine how hard that must've been. So we are stuck with our stepmom, unfortunately. I've been pretty much begging her to help us get our social security cards and high school diplomas so we can get jobs and be able to support ourselves, but she is doing everything in her power to make it not happen. We have nothing, we have no one, and she knows that and takes advantage of it. We feel like we have no way out so much to the point to where we have discussed suicide together, me and my brother. I'm just so sick and tired of living in constant fear of losing everything because of this crazy woman. And it hurts even more seeing the complete void of sadness in my brothers eyes. No one deserves this, not even my worst enemy. We are at our breaking points, and we cant take this much longer. There's so many more things I can mention but I feel like just rambling at this point. So if anyone is reading this, please, I'm begging you. Help us in any way possible. I'm not asking for a pity party or money, but any sort of way that we can leave this place in one piece. It will be extremely appreciated because we feel like we have no escape so this is our final resort.

"One of my best friends (30f) is trying to cut off her abusive parents, sister and aunt basically her whole living immediate family.

The short version 

Her mom is on her mortgage and phone plan. She lives in the same condo community as her aunt.

Me and my wife previously had to file a police report after her aunt wouldn't stop harassing my wife over my friend living with us. They pushed her to buy a condo she couldn't afford with her mom also on the mortgage (she doesn't live there though). Now they want her to spend money on her sister's wedding that she doesn't have

I am seriously worried about her if anyone has gone through this would you be able to share what you did"
"I’m 27 year old female based in India, from somewhat traditional indian household and from backward caste where ladies in the family does not have much say about things. But my upbringing has not been that way, i have always been taught that One should do as they please but being under a limited boundaries. I was child and didn’t know what is happening and always confused my mother’s behaviour towards me but later on i started believing that this is what mother’s love is. but now since my teenage years i have been understanding that my mother has tortured me a lot as a child. She has abused me mentally and that has affected a lot on my personality and commitment issues, along with anxiety. And mentally it took me so long to think logically about this entire scene. I was just 10 years old when i thought of ending my life and wrote a letter about the same because i could not take anymore of my mother’s behaviour towards me and her manipulative and controlling nature was too much for me to understand or handle. But i always thought i could trust my father, turned out i cannot trust him either. I told my father about my wish to marry my long term boyfriend about 4 years ago and at that time my father agreed and asked me to not to tell my mother regarding that, now after 4 years when i asked my father about my wish to marry my boyfriend and being official in-front of entire family he has rejected the proposal and went to my boyfriend’s house and asked his parents to not to let my boyfriend meet anymore and to have this relationship anymore. All this because my boyfriend’s family could not provide him 2 crore rupees which my dad asked in return for my marriage with him. And now he is saying that your boyfriend could not afford the money so i cannot help you anymore and you(I) should do as per I say, which is not making any scene and marry the boy i choose for you from the same community and same caste!!! Moral of the story is my mother is manipulative women who only thinks of her self and when i try to confront her about the same she never once accepted nor actually ever loved me like her daughter and my father is a person who wanted 2 crore rupees from his daughter’s boyfriend and his family so that he can have some money. I am now so much frustrated with people and i want to cut all my ties with them, can someone actually share some advice what can be done in such case?"

"hi, my mom is a drunk. And when I say drunk I mean a gallon of vodka a week (ive calculated). There are plenty of colorful words id like to use to describe her, but you can get the picture based of that. im 18, turning 19 at the end of the month. She used to hit me when I was 14, but only when her drinking gets REALLY bad does she get violent, she usually is just mentally abusive. But anyways, here's what happened:

My bf (19m) and I have been together sense I was 14, he is my rock. He was over the other night and we both worked that day so we had little energy so we just watched Ratatouille and talked for a little while. That's it. He left around midnight, and I was back in my room playing with my cat (1am now). We play this game (that im sure most cat owners do as well), where she's on one side of the door and im on the other, making a string, or pencil pop out and she try to get it. There was no tv or music on, the only noise in the whole house was me talking to my cat. My mom is texting me that ""He needs to leave now."" and a bunch of none sense, (my phone was charging on my bed so I didn't see the text). She then start spam calling me calling me a whore and saying she can hear us (having sex) and that im disgusting (she's been calling me a whore sense before I held a boys hand), I (obviously) get defensive and FaceTime her trying to show her its  just  my cat and I, but she refuses to pick up the call. I tell her to look in the drive way and his car isn't there. BECAUSE HE WASNT. Whatever. I text my boyfriend about it and we had a little laugh of her drunken delusions.

I go to bed and forget anything happen, because nothing really did happen. The next day I do my typical activities and get back home around 4:30. I start to cook my dinner and my step dad starts lecturing me that my boyfriend can't stay that late and I ""really pissed of my mom"" (he has stayed that late and later for years now). I got so mad. Usually I just roll my eyes but her lies and just making me so mad. I tell him what really happened and he said ""I don't want to get involved.""

My mom works from home sense covid when her company made the switch, so at 5pm she came out of her office and I was chopping up veggies for my dinner. She immitaley starts screaming at me calling me a slut, whore, easy blah blah blah (don't think it matters but he's the only person ive been with and we've  been dating sense we were fucking kids.) This makes me so fucking mad because she cheated on my step dad (same dude from above) with a married man and she dresses like a lady of the streets. We start arguing and I don't know why I usually don't feed into it but ut made me so mad. Long story short, my (very short) mom got on her tippy toes to slap me.

I grabbed my stuff and went to my boyfriends house, who's mom offered me a place to stay. Ive stayed with them before (my mom hit a family of 6 and totaled her car when driving to her boyfriends house and loss her license because she was drunk).

I know a slap isn't that bad but it opens the door to much worse. When she first slapped me during her last relapse, it got worse after.

My boyfriend and I plan on moving out this may when I finish my assocites (im at a community college because im trying to save money) but I feel so useless and helpless right now. I am the perfect child any parent would be so proud of me. Im a straight A nursing student, I work 25-30 hours a week, I volunteer and an animal shelter, ive never been to a party, I don't drink or smoke NOTHING. but im never good enough to be left alone.

This argument stuck with me, they usually don't. Im having a hard time doing my school work (taking summer classes to finish sooner), im crying over this drunk again like im a child and I don't have enough energy to see my friends anymore. Im breaking and this situation is my last straw.

I could stay with my boyfriend and his mom (who I love so much), I could stay with my dad (lives 2 hours away), or a could try something else temparly? Please give me suggestions and advice.

(Im sorry if I spelled some words wrong or it doesn't make that much sense in some areas, im distraught right now and don't really care to re-read it)"
"Sorta NSFW, barely. Graffiti mentioned.

My mother's ""celebration of life"" (I had it put together for her siblings) was held in a pavilion at a park last weekend. She'd died in February and was cremated. So we set up the memorial on a table by the wall of the pavilion, with picture boards, her degrees and diplomas, yadda yadda. A while later, I noticed there was some graffiti I'd missed when setting it up: a giant dick drawn in black on a dark brown surface (kinda hard to see). Hairy balls and all. It was absolutely the perfect scenario... any pictures of her memorial will have that in it. Whoever the immature jackass happens to be, I love you for it."
"I finally stood up to my mother after about 21 years of dealing with her abusive shit. I won’t go into specifics but she’s an awful mother but according to her I’ve rewritten the narrative and I’m the awful one. I think I’ll be disowned from my family for finally standing my ground. But I couldn’t take the constant micro aggressions and the love bombing and the manipulation. It’s funny because she said she’d always love and accept me for who I am but she has never done that once and now I think I’ve gone too far. But she has hated who I’ve become and who I love. I had to say something because I knew I couldn’t live with myself if I tried to keep the peace forever. It really hurts because my dad and my brother are innocent and have been abused by her too. I really don’t think I can repair the damage I caused and honestly I’m a little relived I’ve finally been disowned. While I’m not proud of my outburst, she needed to be put in her place, maybe she’ll finally examine how she hurts and manipulates everyone around her. "
"My parents are extremely dirty and filthy people and they are major hoarders. I’ve spent all my life trying to clean up their messes. They leave all their crap everything, many rooms are filled to the brim with their crap. I’ve fought with them so many times telling them to get rid of their shit or just put it away but they don’t give a fuck. I’ve even tried to speak to them calmly about how their mess affects me mentally, but they still do not change. There is no routine cleaning of any areas of the house. To protect my mental sanity I just hole up in my room and rarely come downstairs or interact with them.

They only ever clear stuff up when guests come and they demand that I clean up with them. It frustrates me so much because there have been many time where I will make the house look spotless but they will bring their shit and crap all over the house again and it’s a mess once more. Nothing can be maintained, they are so so comfortable living in a filthy environment. Because of this I have stopped cleaning the house because if they cannot respect themselves and our family enough to keep it clean, then why should I? I don’t have to share any spaces with them, I am fine staying in my room. 

We are middle class and my parents constantly bring home dozens of items from food pantries and we literally have no use or space for these items. They will literally eat moldy food and just scoop out the moldy part and eat the rest of the moldy food. They leave open food out everywhere. We have had several cockroach and mice infestations and I’ve had to beg and scream for us to get pest control treatments. They refuse to continue because they think it’s no major deal having vermin. Our drawers and cabinets in the kitchen and living room are constantly filled with mice poop. Once we had a whole bag of rice that was torn apart by mice and it was filled with mice poop. My parents proceeded to handpick the mouse poop out, wash the rice several times, cook it and serve it to us. I was in absolute shock. Last week I saw a mouse in our DISH RACK. Who knows where these mice get into, they could be crawling over our clean dishes! 

I resort to my bed room and buy and eat packaged food or take out. I despise them and their filth and refuse to help them clean when guests come over, and they will try to emotionally abuse me and even try to hit me if I don’t help them. My mom claims that even if there is crap everywhere that I should still vacuum, dust, and sweep. I don’t even spend any time downstairs, so I don’t even feel obligated to clean there. If they do not respect their children to keep the house clean for them, then why should I clean up for their guests? Plus it feels pointless to me because vacuuming the floor isn’t suddenly going to make the room look spotless. I can clean the fridge but I can’t throw away any old food. I can wipe down all surfaces but there are still doing to be random condiments, bottles, and crap all over the countertops. So what is the point?

Am I in the wrong? Is my response valid? I have currently locked myself into my bedroom because my dad was being physically aggressive and violent. Who the fuck would want to clean your dirty fucking house when you try to intimidate them into doing it."
"is it possible that when a narcissistic parents doesn't like their children, they want them to die? I actually feel with confidence, that my own father want me to die with starvation. He's a mama's boy and he also doesn't have a good childhood but idk what her mother did, because they were just in luck of fortune when it comes to money. Her mother is good at spells and lucks. But I'm not really closed to her. About my dad, he has a lot of money, he could afford therapy for me if he would. But he won't do it because he said he doesn't want to go to jail. which is absolutely the most absurd thing i've ever heard. And so he actually admitted that he's neglecting me. I got distanced to him, and he got distanced to me even more. Eventually, he doesn't really talk about something emotional. He'd end the phone call and tell me he's doing something and he'd call me later. As an excuse. This is so hard to open up with people because even my own family, Mom's side treats me like a black sheep because i chose to do the emotional work. Idk about my fathers side. I'm young only 16.

I feel like my dad just wants me to be depressed and kill myself.





⬇️p.s u don't have to read this, just some details

( Idk what he's doing. He has 2 cars he lives in USA. And he says he's gonna take me to US and live with him, I'm currently on another country with my mom's, they're divorce when I was 3. And about that, i've been waitibg for 6 years to approve my visa, and now i'm 16 but he said it was not approved yet. He showed me when i was 13 on a video call, there's a room for me when i'll live with him. Maybe one thing that hesitated him is he knows I prefer to do the emotional work and one thing that my dad hate is emotions. Bc what could've been happen in 6 years?? )"
"I am a 16yr old girl who is in a relationship and is planning to pursue psychology for my bachelors next year. Tell me why my parents care so much about what I pursue solely because of their reputation. I am being forced to take MBBS (medical/doctor) even tho I don't want to because they want me to and I am also being forced to break up with my boyfriend and have also been through numerous situations of physical and verbal abuse for the both of them. After a certain point in life I feel like its a bit too much when your parents try to control things that don't bother them like if u want me to do something so tedious and suicidal as medical then you should've done it yourself and not just force me to do something I don't want to do. Abusive parents may not realize it but when they're giving birth to a child its not just a child its a whole person. The person does not have to think like you, act like you, or live like you. Its so ridiculous at this point and it pisses me off. REALLY BAD."
"My mother wrongfully hit me when I was young, and when she got tired she left… and then she came back refreshed and continued to beat me. Nothing I said could make her stop. 

It’s decades later but every single time I think of her hitting me, which is every time I think of her, I begin to feel a deep anger. I do not like the feeling. It’s poisonous to my soul. 

I read the body keeps the score, and learnt about the ACE (adverse childhood experiences) test, and don’t want to die from a stroke in my 40s or  be “found alone at home” because of something I had no control over when I was a kid. "

"My family has been in a cult my whole life. I’ve finally stood up for myself and now I have two weeks to get out. I need $300 to finish paying for car things and then I’m free. My job won’t give me hours, DoorDash isn’t working, and I can’t borrow from anyone because no one who still likes me has money. Idk what to do I’m so close to freedom but also so close to giving up. At this point I will do pretty much anything. "
"Please do NOT say “if you think hitting kids is okay then you did not turn out right”.

That is a circular argument, or a tautological one. We are establishing whether the claim hitting kids is okay for discipline is okay, so we can’t use that assumption that it is not in the argument.

Sorry, but if we resort to tautological arguments, we are no better than people who say “because I did so”. "
"*Controlling and Abusive Warning*

A bit of backstory:
My (29f) father (56m) has always been over controlling. Hated when I died my hair, and that I got small tattoos on my arms (all as an adult). 
When I had my oldest son at 18, he smacked my now-husband in the back of the head, which obviously wasn’t good for their relationship.

Additionally backstory:
A friend and I went for a walk the other day at a park and saw a Loon. I was so excited because I had never seen one (we live in Canada). My friend (20m) is from outside the country and I explained that a Loon is on a Loonie and all that.
We then realized it was a duck and I was disappointed. We continued to make jokes that I’d get a stuffed duck and name is Loon.


The story:
I graduated college yesterday and invited both my parents (who are separated). My mom stayed home with my kids and watched the graduation’s livestream, while by dad, brother, and husband attended in person.
After the graduation, my dad and I were talking and he said “so, should I kick your ankle out?” I was confused, then realized he had just seen my new ankle tattoo. I said it was cute, and my body. He didn’t like that.
After pictures, we threw a bbq at my place. Some of my friends—including the one who I saw the duck with—and their families joined.
My father was pressuring my oldest to hug him, which made my son very uncomfortable. I tried standing up for him by saying it was his choice. I ended up getting overwhelmed with the party and later found out that my father forced a hug from my son.
As the party was winding down, my friend told me that he and his brother saw a Loon yesterday while out for a walk. On instinct I yelled “Fuck, really?” Which they laughed at.
My father, who was across the room said “what did you say?” I then repeated myself more quietly.
He then walked over and lightly smacked either side of my face. (I say it was light, but another friend (21f) said it made a sound and my jaw hurt after.) he said I got a snack for either time I said it.


For reference: 
My kids were playing in the basement. They have heard me curse before and are old enough to know that f*ck is a “adult work”. 

I’m debating on cutting him off, or if I should give him a warning? I’m just scared he’ll call me yelling. 
We moved 3hrs away from him three years ago and I thought our relationship was getting better. Apparently not.
I had an anxiety attack at 1am because of the whole ordeal.

I also spoke to my son this morning and assured him that he is loved and apologized for not being able to stand up for him more and told him that if he ever felt u comfortable in the future, that he is more than welcome to lock himself in his room so he can feel safe (my father went into my son’s room when he wanted to be alone and ended up getting the hug then.
We don’t see my dad often, and my son has high anxiety too, so he doesn’t like hugging most people."

"So i guess the purpose of this post is pretty clear. My parents are both very abusive. They are what you would call helicopter parents. They try to control every aspect of my life. Recentyl, I graduated highschool and I am finally done with all of my college entrance exams. I have finally gotten a break after 3 years of continuous hardwork. I didn't have summer or winter or spring etc etc break. I also attended every single class diligently, even showing up to school with a bad fever or heavy rainfall.  Now my dad wants me to study AGAIN. He says i am waisting my time by relaxing and i am not doing anything productive. I like painting so I paint alot because I couldn't even do that for the past 3 years. I also like playing video games. To me, i am being productive by investing in my hobbies. I am autistic and i have adhd. I am extremely burned out. I even faint randomly. I feel so lost because my mom is also so overwhelming. She shouts like a maaniac and only cares for my elder sister. My elder sister who is 21 is entitled and toxic. She absues me and has always made me feel worthless ever since we were kids. She is shouting at me at the moment of me writing this post. What the hell am I supposed to do? i will finally leave for my uni this August but i feel like i can't hold on for that long. I am suic!dal.

"hello, i am 19 female here. i have struggled horribly with my mental health, from the abuse i've faced as a child and teenager. i don't even remember some of my childhood because it was so bad, but these are just some that i remember. they have done so many things to me and i am just so sick and tired of it.

when i was a kid, my mom beat me for not drinking a glass of water and dumped it on my head. i was 4.

when i was a kid, i used her bangle to trace a circle, and i took a nap so naturally i forgot where i put it. she beat me and put all my toys in the trash thinking that i was ""lying and hiding it somewhere."" i was 4.

when i was a kid, she would hit me a lot for simple things, like not getting dressed fast.

when i was a kid, she hit me and screamed at me for changing my barbie doll's outfit, claiming that i am a pervert and i was creepy. i was 5.

when i was a kid, my mom asked me for the scissors. she was laying on the sofa. so i put it flat on her chest since she was laying down, not pointing towards her or anything. she turned to me, started screaming hysterically and crying that i tried to kill her, and beat me. i was 6.

when i was a kid, she would constantly say i have no respect for her because i didn't say ""mommy"" at the end of each sentence. she would beat me and scream at me. i was 6.

when my younger sister was born, i took a lot of care of her, and i was 7. they just let me do everything for her. i fell behind on my homework because of that and i got beat.

when i wanted to hang out with my friend who was a different religion from me, they would scream at me, and say horrible things about her and not let me see her. eventually i was not able to see any of my friends, and i could not even ask for permission to leave the house. i became so lonely. i was 9.

they would get mad when i wore pants in the house and strictly wanted me to wear underwear in the house. when i did wear them, i would get my butt slapped or squeezed by both parents. this went on until i was 9 years old. all of a sudden, they wanted me to cover up once i turned 10, and even wearing skinny jeans was horrible. 

when i wore skinny jeans around the ages 10-11, since everyone in my school was wearing it and i didn't want to be made fun of, my dad accused me of trying to show off my body to everyone, and screamed that i am losing my self respect. i was an underdeveloped child.

i got my period when i just turned 10. i was not allowed to have sex ed, my parents didn't consent, so i did not know what a period was. they said that what is happening to me is really bad and i cannot tell anyone. and i am not allowed to touch animals or plants, and i do they will die because of me. they did not give me menstrual pads, they gave me diapers, ""the ones old people use? and convinced me that i had some disease and i was going to die soon. they had me do that for a year. whenever i got my period in school i felt so uncomfortable putting on a diaper and so afraid someone may see it and make fun of me. i did not know periods were a normal thing until i was 11. i asked them about it, and their reasoning was i was too young so they were ashamed and thought i could not handle how to use a pad properly.

i was not allowed to listen to music that was not religious until the age of 12. when my dad saw me listening to music with headphones, he screamed at me, told me i was listening to vulgar lyrics, and i am trying to be an adult so bad by getting into bad content. 22 by taylor swift is apparently vulgar.

when i was 12-13 i dated my first boyfriend. when we broke up i cried and my mom noticed. when i lied about it she said she knew it was about a guy so i had to tell her i had a boyfriend. she beat me, screamed at me, threw a bottle of mouthwash at me, and threw my instrument i played for school, a saxophone against the wall.

when i was 13, in 9th grade, i switched my career focus path out of computer science to undecided as after one semester i realized i did not enjoy it. additionally, my parents were the one who wanted me to do computer science. i forgot to tell them i switched, and my mom saw my courses online after i switched. she asked me where computer science was and i told her i switched it and i forgot to tell her. that day she went ballistic on me. she called me a failure, called my whole extended family saying i was going to work in mcdonald's for the rest of my life, beat me horribly, and then choked me. i thought i was going to die that day so i pushed her, and then she started crying and screaming to my dad that i hit her. then my dad scolded me saying that a child cannot hit the parent but the parent can hit the child. my mom said she will stop this argument if i choose to either become a doctor or engineer. not knowing what to do i just picked doctor. i kept that path in high school for them.

when i was 13 turning 14, i had wanted to wear a dress to school for my birthday. she said my dress was too short even though it was above the knees, and i said it wasn't, and she said that i won't understand and i should get raped so i actually understand. a few weeks after that i got sexually assaulted in a hoodie and sweatpants.

we went on vacation and randomly my father started ignoring me and being misognystic towards me. and i started crying and told him to please not say that and women and men are equal. he said that i am worth a 0 and he doesn't care ever and over again as i was bawling in his face. i was 14.

i told my father i felt sexually harassed by my school coach. he said that he coach probably sees me as a grandchild and i need to stop assuming bad things about men. the coach pressed his front to my back while i was trapped and could not away.

in the pandemic my grades dropped and i was very suicidal. instead of supporting me, they told my sister to not talk to me until my grades went up. i was already incredibly lonely. i had a mandatory therapist from my school as my school found out about how suicidal i was.

i had to do a mental health screening with my pediatrician and my result was really bad. my mom talked about how i cut myself just because i got yelled at over simple things. the doctor reprimanded at her that she needs to actually support me as a mother and i am clearly struggling. she said i had to see a therapist sooner. when we got in the car, i asked her if i was getting a therapist. she told me to shut up and there is nothing wrong with me and i lied to the pediatrician.

i was really suicidal when i was 13 and instead of getting me help my dad dragged me on the floor with my hair, beat me until i was a ball on the floor, and video called relatives showing me crying that i wanted to die.

i started developing a bigger chest when i was 16. i was only allowed to wear baggy clothes then, and i had to dress masculine. my dad would compliment me saying i actually looked respectable. i enjoy dressing ultra feminine, soft and coquette fashion. i hated myself so much for the way i looked.

whenever i showed any bit of my figure or my chest looked big, both my mother and father would slut shame me and say i was losing respect for myself. i was 16-17 and i never had any self esteem because i felt so ugly wearing masculine clothes and not being able to show even a little bit of my figure which i had grown to like.

i gained weight due to depression and my family both body shamed me instead of encouraging me to work out or be healthier.

when i started going to college i stopped answering their calls often. i had to live with them during holidays though. after my first year i realized i did not want to do STEM and pursue the medical field. i was screamed at horribly by my mother saying what will happen to our family reputation if i end up a failure doing a simple job after coming all the way to america. i ended up choosing a field i genuinely liked after months of thinking but still makes good pay, but not STEM/med related. i wish they told me there's other opportunities outside of those 2 things to make a good living.

my sister was failing out of middle school and she did not get any consequences from it instead they just made me do her homework for her when i had my own COLLEGE assignments to do.

recently i have told them that i have a boyfriend and i have been going out with him. he makes me so happy and actually unconditionally loved. i told my mom and at first she sounded accepting. i felt hopeful that my relationship with her will actually be repaired. as weeks progressed she started being really aggressive and started indirectly slut shaming me, saying i have no dignity, there's no need for me to see my boyfriend and i should focus on school. my father is completely ignoring my existence for the last few weeks. after months of therapy trying to forgive them for all the abuse they caused me in my childhood and teenage years. now i am not being allowed to go out with anyone, but im going to break that rule. this is my last straw. after realizing that i can actually be unconditionally loved, appreciated, and cared for. i just want to leave. i don't care if it's a dumb idea. i just want to go no contact with them immediately because i cannot stand being treated so sub humanely anymore. i am tired of being controlled. i called the suicide hotline 2 times this week because it hurt so much and while i was talking to them something in me just snapped. i am just done with this treatment. i am so so done. i want to leave, i cannot live 2 more years like this. if there's any way i can get help financially to move out please let me know. any tips for this is appreciated."
"It's currently 1.50 am and my father isn't letting us (me,my mom and sisters )sleep he's breaking stuffs he's cursing at us(in the worst way possible)and he does this everyday we don't really do anything about it and sometimes when we eventually fall asleep he comes and kick my mom and throw stuffs at us ,play loud music ,tries to pick up a fight and more and on top of that he even threatens us that he would kill us(and he's tried in the past once )idk what to do like literally it's been years and we still going through the same thing everyday this guy is insane and he might really kill us anytime possible i asked my mom to take action about it but oh my lord nothing changes no one really takes our side he always acts as a victim which is so fucking stupid i don't even know if he is a human or not does he hates us to his core but what have we done nothing but exist and he does all of these for funn"
"Hello, I came here on this thread to ask for help 
I 20 (f) currently live in France and live in a very toxic household with parents that abuse me physically and mentally.


A few years back I met someone who lives in the United States and it’s been a moment we’re talking about meeting each other again and have me come over to spend some vacation 

Of course telling my parents would have been hard but I put enough on the side and managed to get a plane ticket back and forth to see him


I recently told them I’m going at first they were supportive of it until 2 days ago and now they’re forcing me to cancel my plane tickets and force me to go back to my country which is an isle far away from France (it’s still part of France) and I don’t know what to do I’ve been encouraged to not cancel the ticket and still go but I’ve been threatened that my sister who is with my parents to make sure that I get on that plane


So right now I’m really confused and I don’t know what to do which is why I’m asking help here on Reddit "
"So my mom got remarried when I was 12 and I’m 23 now. I already went through college and graduated and had to move back home because the job market is just terrible and I cannot support myself even with roommates. Upon moving back home I noticed ring (the security company) cameras started getting placed outside my bedroom door. Then another one got added pointing at the fridge. I’ve suffered with an ED my whole life and get extremely anxious about eating around anyone let alone my stepdad who I actively hate as he has emotionally and verbally abused me since I was 12. To counter this, I started covering them up with a dish towel when I would make food and then uncovered them when I was done. I got a pretty hateful text from him yelling at me for covering them up saying they’re because I’m not allowed to eat anything I didn’t buy because I’m grown… like that’s fine but it was never discussed with me… my mom always feels like she’s stuck in the middle with us because we never get along but she’s acting like there’s literally nothing wrong with a stepdad putting cameras outside his 23 year old step daughters room and occasionally when I’m not home, going through my room and drawers to try and “catch me in the act” whatever that means. Am I in the wrong for covering up the cameras?"
"My father has been abusing me verbally and physically for my whole life. I’m 17 now and my parents were separated for 2 years. During that time I was so happy, but because in my culture it’s frowned upon if a woman lives alone without her husband, my mother’s  family forced her to get him back. Father has hit my mother many times, once he even broke a bucket on her head. He has hit her with a large metal spoon to the point where the spoon was completely bent. My mother is a strong woman and she didn’t take his bullshit and kicked him out. He has hit me many times, with wood, metal, broke my nail, left my entire arm bruised, almost pushed me to death because I defended myself, kicked me because I didn’t massage his feet right, told me to kill myself when I asked him to recharge my mobile phone, beat me with his shoe in front of everyone because I didn’t get his phone on time when it was ringing. And many more. When my mother brought him back I was devastated. Since that day onwards I’ve been having insomnia, I can’t eat properly, I don’t wanna live, I wanna run away, I’m always irritated. My father is jobless and my mother is working so he tries to act sweet to her because he hasn’t got any money (all he does is sit and watch tv all day and acts like he’s the most knowledgable person in the world) he’s and asshole and he knows that I don’t like him so he makes sure that my life is a living hell. He’s always criticising and ridiculing any minuscule thing I do. He tries to control me. I hate him so much I wish we would just die. When I told this to my mother she said that she’s too tired to listen to me and always tells me to just obey him. I hate my life I’m so tired I’m so fucking done I’ve been living like this for my entire life. What do I  do please someone help. My best friend betrayed me. Her brother ridiculed me and she defended him. I’m so mentally exhausted"
"Hello, I am a 25 year old girl. I am currently living with my parents because my situation does not allow me to do otherwise (I am studying and unemployed). This Christmas my parents kicked me out of the house (everything was very violent) but as a result of my situation, I had to return. My mother is not well, she is an unstable person who needs urgent psychological treatment, my father is afraid of her and feels he is indebted to her because she forgave him for cheating on her for 15 years about an addiction she had, so he defends her in everything. I have no friends currently living in my city and in short I am quite lonely. Now I fear for my physical integrity, my mother had already hit me this Christmas (and during my childhood my parents always hit my brother and me) but yesterday she tried to hit me with a cooking pot (quite blunt) on the head. I wanted him to hit me, honestly. Because if I survived the blow I would have evidence to report her. But she was smart enough to control herself and she smashed the ladle on the floor (but that could have been my head). In case you are wondering, my father witnessed the whole thing without doing anything and supports her. Everyone who loves me is asking me to get out of there, even my brother who left home a few months ago. My problem is that the abuse has not only been physical, it has been psychological abuse for years where she has convinced me that without her I am worthless, I am useless and I could not survive. I know that being aware is the first step and at least now, thanks to my psychologist, I can see things better. I am trying little by little to learn not to blame myself and to know that I don't deserve to be treated like this, no matter how much I have been convinced that I do. And that I am valid and that without it I won't die. I'm desperately trying to find a job doing whatever I can to get away from home. In case you're wondering, I can't count on my brother, he also had to flee a couple of months ago, he sleeps on a sofa bed in a sublet flat and earns 800€ a month working in a bar. There are days when I don't want to wake up because I don't want to continue suffering. I am neglecting my master's degree because of this situation and my life in general. The saddest thing is that despite everything I have told you, I am incapable of hating my mother. I mean, I hate her at times and I know she is an abuser, but I feel sorry for her, I love her and I even want to help her others. I think this is the worst thing I have ever been through and I don't know if I will ever experience anything like this again or worse in my life. Considering that I am only 25 years old I think it is a strong thing to say. Lastly, neither my family nor I come from a marginalised background, we are a middle class (slightly upper) family who live comfortably. But my parents will NEVER give me money to become independent, they didn't even give me money to study, I had to have scholarships for excellence every year of my degree to be able to continue studying and last year I worked as a telemarketer to save money to be able to pay for the master's degree I'm currently doing. 

Thanks for reading."
"I (18F) haven't been allowed to go to friend's houses since elementary school when I went to a private school where my parents could actually know the other parents. I had one girl over after she insisted when I was a middle schooler in public school and that went awry (she behaved poorly) and since then I haven't been allowed to have anyone else over period. For years I was told no bf till 18, something I obeyed in freshman and sophmore years, towards the end of junior year I got a bf that I hid until they eventually found out  about - I was 17 when they found out. Previous to meeting this guy I had another very short term bf they also found about and I did dump at their command. Now, keep in mind, I've been a very good student for years mostly A's only one C in all four years of high school (macroeconomics), I took AP courses and DC classes and passed them all. So in all matters of college it's always been made clear by my father that I was to be a lawyer and there was no other choices - when I try to tell him about my passion for writing and computer science (separately - primarily interested in writing) it's shut down with talks of how I'm going to be a lawyer then a judge and do what he wants in our city. My mother is more lax on that, but still insisted I be a lawyer. And when talking about it to others or them it's easier to talk about what I'm going to college for a bachelor's degree for, so she took that as me not going to do it and ditching it for my bf who is two grades below me though he's 17. They badger me about this any time the topic is brought up and it significantly raises my anxiety.

Previous to having my bf, I was in a deep depression and they somehow didn't notice, he helped put me back together. The only times we could hang out though was in a club after school, so we did that and my father said I could walk to the local gas station with friends from the club, so I went with them sometimes or I went with the bf and we'd stay out a bit longer, just hanging out on school property. When my parents found out they pulled me from every one of my clubs and they had recently let me hang out with one friend out of school because they knew his parents well, I was no longer allowed to hang out with him either because I might be around bf. I am no longer allowed to do pretty much anything that means leaving the house. I own a car, but I'm not allowed to go for drives even though they said I would be able to. I wasn't allowed to have a job while in high school, so I have borderline nothing saved up for school, they also are unwilling to pay for my college in any form aside from MAYBE meal plan, saying that they did everything they were going to while I was in high school.

On top of the issues with college, while I was with my bf, my father kept threatening violence towards him - so I told bf to stay away from my father, also my father told me that if he ever was around the kid that he would hurt him badly. When I was somewhat allowed to be with bf they constantly would tell me that I was a wet blanket now, that there's nothing to me, and talk about how I was giving up everything (I wasn't in the slightest), and insult me frequently. They even got my youngest brother to start doing the same as well. I can't talk with my bf through text because they might see it and get onto me, I have to use apps that i have to delete frequently and my phone gets put up at night so I rely on my computer. They said if I ever go to his house they'll call the police and say there's drugs in the house. They also talk about how if I go over there I'll be raped by the stepfather, trafficked, that the parents will hurt me in ways that will eventually kill me and that when it happens they'll be on anyone's side but mine. (They detail the ways I would be harmed.)

In the past they've got me so stressed and anxious that I can't eat, I cry myself to sleep, then they threaten to take me to the mental hospital for not eating or acting upset in any way. I said I might not come home some weekends of college and they took that badly and went back to talking about every possible bad thing that apparently will happen when I go to bf's house. I have had to keep my best friend hidden for 4 years now because they don't like his family, so I have to talk to him the same way I do with my bf, through other chat apps. I'm barely able to tell them about my actual passions because they don't care though they say I never talk to them. It got so bad when I was somewhat allowed to be with him that I started making plans to run away, then I let it slip in one of our fights that I could just leave and stay with bf. Since then, they've been threatening violence towards him more than ever and they know the police and sheriff in my town and talk about how no one would ever believe I've been treated bad ever and that I haven't ever been treated bad. I really don't know what to do. I'm running out of options and all the options I have are bad. Stay, leave bf - be miserable and lose the things that make me happy and the main person I can talk to. Stay, stay with him, continue life like this and watch everything get taken away. Leave, stay with a friend so they can't find me, lose them and my siblings. In any situation I'm miserable, but if I leave, I just stay in the college dorms and stay with a friend on breaks. I hate it here too often and stay in a mild panic thinking that if I can just make it through the day, it's another day closer to being free-ish."
"AITAH for telling my bfs mom to stop mooching off him and get a job?
Ok, so this has gone on for YEARS. Bfs mom (we'll call her Karen) has REFUSED to TRY working a day in her life. She forces bf (20 yr old) to supply EVERYTHING for her. She has put his life in MULTIPLE ways yet she plays victim any time he tries to defend himself. She has tried yanking the gear shift in the car, tried to yank steering wheel, pressed false charges on bf's brother having him arrested, and now that it's just Bf and Karen in the house she forces him to pay ALL the bills, food, EVERYTHING. She claims she filed for disability but doesn't go to doctors, doesn't attempt to work from home in any way, or anything! He tried telling her to stop spending HIS money and she screams financial abuse and everything. I finally snapped. I'm literally dying and still pay my own bills. AITAH for calling her out for being an abusive lazy pos that needs to get a job and stop being a mooch, a leech, a bum if you will. She is practically a squatter."
"I’d like to start off by saying I’m very nervous too call my parents abusers. That’s a very strong word very negative and it would mean I need a lot more help than I am willing to allow myself to believe as of right now. I love my parents. I believe they love me, but when I was younger, the way that I was treated is a haunting memory.

 My mother was the main person that would hit me physically. She would give me whoopings for something’s (which is in someways normalized) but she would also have bouts of angriness about things that I said, or did that would make her go absolutely ballistic on me. These were usually things that were small, but her emotions would be at a boiling point and she would let them spill over physically punching, and sometimes kicking me. This was mainly when I was younger and had less ability to fight back. I am now bigger than my mother so her trying to beat me up would result in her most likely also getting hurt.

 My dad has always come to my rescue at these times, afterward he ignores my mom for a week and she blames me and my disrespect (which I have said some disrespectful things but nothing to warrant that reaction) And then everything goes back to normal. My dad also has bouts of angriness they are less common than my mothers, and he usually does not hurt me as bad as he works to display that he is stronger than me. There is also a lot of gaslighting and manipulation that goes along with this that I cannot get into because who has the time😭😭"

"I'm going off to Job Corps in a couple of weeks. I told him I could take care of myself, then he laughed and said ""we'll see"". I know he expects me to quit the program and come crawling back to him... but what if I do? What if I can't take care of myself after all? I'm trying not to let him fuck with my confidence but I can't help but have that nagging feeling that maybe he's right. "
"As the title says. I've made several other posts about specifically what I'm gonna DO when I leave / get kicked out, and while I have a few plans for when it does eventually happen, the fucking constant stream of negativity is just too much for me to handle.

A while ago, my mom went out of state with my siblings to go visit some family. I stayed behind with my stepdad to occasionally clean the house and go to my stepdads office to clean for some extra money. And holy shit, best 11 days of my life. The anxiety was still there, 100%, but everything just felt so peaceful, and mellow. I genuinely felt happy. If I wanted to get up, and just make myself a grilled cheese or a quesadilla, simply because I felt like it, I could. I was able to finish watching Breaking Bad (a show my mom kind of blew up at me for watching, because my bio dad was an addict at one point, and for some reason she thought I was watching the show to learn how to make meth, which uh, just what the fuck?) and I was also just able to nap and relax whenever I felt like it.

I had chores to do, but I could do them at my own pace, and considering that I'm autistic and I have sensory issues, just being able to get them done when I feel good about doing them just... Felt absolutely wonderful. I didn't have to worry about getting them done literally as soon as I wake up, and I didn't have to worry about her screaming at me and bursting through my door because I put a dish in the wrong cabinet or some shit. I could just take my time, and do things at my own pace. I actually felt MORE motivated to do housework simply due to the fact that I could do it at my own pace, without having to worry about my mom's verbal abuse. 

I honestly can't begin to describe how nice it felt those 11 days. Genuinely some of the best days of my life, because I could just take things at my own pace and like... Be me. Something I'm really not able to do around her.

And then she showed back up.

From the first fucking MOMENT she arrived, we were already having issues. According to her, I looked scared when I was helping bring in groceries and stuff (expressing fear around her is a death sentence) and later, when she ended up yelling at me over essentially the same thing, she made a sarcastic remark about how ""OBVIOUSLY I seem to be UNCOMFORTABLE around her"" and how ""She doesn't HAVE to live here"". About a year ago, when she kind of forced me to admit I was suicidal (she hit me in the face immediately and mocked me), I let it slip that I was VERY uncomfortable around her, which is absolutely true. She's been using this piece of knowledge against me, and she brings it up in order to make me feel ashamed and guilty.

She's yelled at me a handful of times over me looking afraid and uncomfortable around her (she's been here like 3 days) and just... I am so fucking constantly stressed. My chest is tight 24/7, my mind is racing, my entire body just... Feels horrible because of the anxiety, my sensory issues are getting worse, and everything just feels so shitty honestly.

Another thing I should mention.

I'm using a backup phone right now. She doesn't know I own this. My regular phone was taken from me because she looked through it and saw me researching CPS and online abuse communities. This backup phone is basically the only way for me to talk to my LDR partner (my mom is convinced the they're a pedophile trying to sell me into a human trafficking ring, and she CONSTANTLY misgenders and generally dehumanizes them. Her reasoning for ALL of this, is because she found a message where they were discussing a VPN they used, that's literally it), and as well as that, this phone is my only way to research what I'm gonna do when I either leave or get kicked out.

I have a little under 500 dollars at the moment, and I have a little less than a year until I turn 18. I don't have a driver's license, and my mom got mad at me because of it, saying that I need to take initiative and ask her to take me driving so I can prepare to get my license. Here's the thing, I REALLY don't want to fucking talk to her, at all, whatsoever, let alone drive around a parking lot for 30 minutes with her breathing down my neck. But at the same time, there's really no other way for me to get my license, and I don't think there's anyone else who can take me driving. My current plan is to just save any money that I get, and try to find either a roommate online, or a REALLY cheap 1-bedroom apartment, which is easier said than done.

We live in a very Republican, middle of nowhere area, and there aren't that many jobs around. I'm afraid that if I get kicked out or leave or whatever, and I find a temporary place to live, my mom might find where I work. Absolutely fucking scares me. I'll also probably have to just walk back and forth to the store, wherever i work, and generally anywhere else I might need to go, and it gets HOT in this area. I honestly feel like most places probably won't hire me if I don't have a car, considering that I'd come to work sweating bullets every day. Other than that, in order to actually get money, I'll probably just try to donate plasma as much as I realistically can, because I just don't have many other options.

There is no way I'd be able to go to college ANY time soon, basically 0% chance. My grades are absolutely terrible, and I am NOT going to get myself involved with the predatory as fuck student loan system, not a chance.

Y'know how in TV shows, there's always like, a ""loser"" character, who just lives in a tiny apartment, and stays inside playing videogames or just hanging out with friends? I would genuinely be so fucking happy with that life. Just having my own, private space to live, and just being able to spend time with whatever hobbies interest me, and just generally not going out much. That sounds like the fucking DREAM to me, seriously. I uh, do not require a lot to be happy lol, not much at all. But even like, small, shitty apartments are EXPENSIVE now, and I was never really able to learn about things like taxes, rent, or any of that because nobody really ever taught me. Everything I know about paying taxes, and filing for disability, I learned from secretly researching overnight on this tiny backup phone that I keep under my pillow. 

Everything just feels so... Overwhelming. I'm turning into a legal adult soon, but I'm not really excited. Unless I know for certain that I'll be able to secure housing soon, as well as a job, it's kind of impossible for me to really be happy at the moment.

And even excluding ALL of that, I'm STILL constantly fucking stressed and physically/mentally overstimulated because of my mother constantly making my life absolute hell. Things just feel so bleak and hopeless. If she finds out about this phone, it's over, and I'm fucked. I won't be able to research housing options, I won't be able to communicate with my partner at all, and I won't have access to abuse communities.

Just... Any advice whatsoever would be lovely. I guess just about like, finances, tracking down a cheap apartment or roommate, getting a job, taxes, coping with the fucking debilitating stress, anything at all. Thanks for taking the time to read this. <3"
"Trigger warning: child abuse. 

This is going to be a long post that requires some background. I recently told my younger sibling a secret that we have been keeping until he was old enough and he did not react the way I thought he would. I really do not know what to do now and I need some advice/ validation? I am sorry for the length and how messy it will be, this whole situation has been rattling around in my brain and I think it will help to write it down. Please do not be afraid to ask for clarification. Names will be changed for privacy. I also do not know what community to post this on, open for suggestions. 

I (24F) have three siblings; I don't talk to one, but the others I try to keep in contact with. I will refer to the eldest one as Frank(28) and the younger one as Harry (18) .

When we were growing up, we lived in extreme poverty and the 2008 recession hit us pretty hard. Harry was too young to really remember to extremely difficult times but there were times I remember crying because I was so hungry. The house we lived in was also disgusting and we were never really taught the importance of basic hygiene. Our mother was a piece of shit. She would sit in her room 24/7, smoking cigarettes and playing on her phone and ignoring us at all costs. She would force our father to get her fast food while we were to scrounge whatever we could in the house. This forced me and the other older siblings to take care of one another, especially taking care of Harry. I could talk forever about how she did us, the older siblings, dirty. 

My father on the other hand, I want to say he did the best he could but I know better. He has a short temper and was prone to exploding and punching holes in walls. TRIGGER WARNING: he was also the one who sexually abused me and my older siblings until I was about 8. I have conflicting feelings about my father because how could someone do that to their child, a person they brought into this world to raise and protect. On the other side, he took care of us, fed and clothed us. 

After I turned 14, I started isolating myself. I kept to my room and focused on my school work, made online friends. A few years pass and I started hanging out with my siblings again and we became close once more. I did my best to teach Harry how to treat people with respect. He grew up to be one of the best people I know, which makes it hurt significantly more that he treated me in this manner.  

At 19, I moved out and I cut contact with my parents shortly after that. I know this was extremely hard on Harry because he was left alone with my parents. Despite our parents being horrible people- they were better to Harry than the rest of the siblings. After things became better money wise, they started to get involved in his life, going to school functions, buying him things, etc.. I have this one specific example: one time, when the older two siblings left the house, our parents wanted to go on trip. I was about 18 at the time and I worked a full time job and needed to give them a months notice if I wanted to go on vacation. Instead of informing me ahead of time, they told me a week before, rented a car, and then left without me. I was obviously very upset about this, and my father promised me that we could plan a vacation for later that summer. When they came back a week later, I learned that Harry had caused them to spend more than intended which meant that my vacation would suffer. I ended up paying for basically everything but gas and it was only a two day trip in our tiny shitty car. I am not bitter about the money, hell, once I got a job I spoiled that little boy too. I am bitter about how our parents seem to care more about him though. 

That is not the issue honestly, just a little background to understand more of where Harry is coming from.

When I cut contact with our parents, Harry was confused and hurt. I also believe that our parents tried to get him to tell them why I choose to cut them off. The thing is, I did not tell Harry what our father did; I wanted to let him have his parents while he could. Frank and I discussed that we would tell him after he graduated- but I ended up moving across the country when he was about 17. I felt that this was a conversation that needed to happen in-person. I came back to my home town for his graduation; I wasn't going to tell him on the day of his graduation because that would be awful and that day was about him. I was there for a whole week, I informed him months prior that I would be there. I know that week is pretty busy and hectic, but I only saw him for about 20 minutes after he walked the stage. I was supposed to go to his graduation dinner, but when I saw him on the field after getting his diploma, my mother ran up to me and tried to give me a hug. I stuck my arm out and told her fuck no. She ended up running away crying and my father told me that ""they didn't appreciate the attitude"". Honestly, it was pretty cathartic telling her no and it was the highlight of that trip. After that, I made a plan with Harry to see him at least once more during the week before I had to go back home. We went on a 20 minute walk, and during this walk I asked him and Frank to come visit me next (2024) summer. They agreed and seemed excited about it, and they had plenty of time to plan and save money.

Flash forward to December of the same year, I went back to see them. During this trip, I saw Harry for 2 hours at a local coffee shop and I stayed at Frank's apartment for the week. I reminded them that I will see them in the summer and they looked apprehensive which confused me. After going through the details, they reiterated that they were in-fact coming to see me in the summer. I chose not to tell Harry about our father at this time because we were in public and this was also the first time I met his girlfriend, so again not an appropriate time. Frank and I did discuss in length that we were going to tell him when they came up to see me in June. February rolls along, and I ask them how they were doing on saving for their trip to see me. This is when Harry decided to let us know that he was not coming. He felt like it was unfair to him that we did not tell him what was going on with me and our parents- Frank did not cut contact with our parents btw- and he told us that it was hurting our parents. He also expressed grievances about how it felt like we didn't care about him when we were growing up and constantly teased him. To clarify, we would joke about his hair because it was a little frizzy and his acne but nothing excessive and we would have stopped if he had simply told us it bothered him. Harry also talked about how it hurt that we kept this big secret from him and that we didn't trust him. To end it all, he said he did not think it was worth it to come up and see me. I was crushed. My baby brother did not think I was worth it. I left our group conversation and did not talk to him for months.

Now comes to the heart of the problem. In May, I felt like it was time to tell my grandmother what a shit human her son was- but Frank and I decided that Harry deserved to know first. I got in contact with Harry and scheduled a phone call between the all of us and this is where it gets super messy so bare with me please.

It was so awkward at first because I did not know where to start and Frank wanted me to lead this conversation. I asked Harry if I should just say it or ease into it. He told me to say it. So I told him that our father would regularly abuse us for a span of about 5 years. He said okay. This shocked me, and made me angry ngl. I was going to say more because I thought maybe he didn't understand the implications of what I said- he interrupted me and yelled that he heard what I said the first time. I was astounded. I asked how he could be so casual about it, and he said ""I thought it would be worse."" I don't know if I could ever forgive him for some of the things he said during this phone call. I understand not wanting to know the details, but he was cruel. I asked him if he remembered our father throwing our brothers around and his anger, he told me yes, but ""I don't see how hard he is trying."" Fuck that first off. I asked how could this not change anything for him, and he asked me if I wanted him to be angry. I was shocked, did I? Now that I look back, of course I did. This man, our father, was supposed to protect us and he caused us life lasting pain- yes I wanted it to change things for him. I wanted Harry to at least  grieve for our childhood, I wanted him to understand us more. Instead he was apathetic towards it and angry at us. He said that it didn't affect him then and it doesn't affect him now and that it hurt more that we didn't trust him. I understand him feeling isolated because we choose for him, decided that he wasn't mature enough. On the other hand, how could he forgive our father for years of pain and abuse and not forgive us for trying to spare him a little. 

I had a panic attack in the middle of this phone call and left for about 20 minutes- during that time I tried calling my support system. No one answered except my grandmother, who was deeply concerned but also was in the middle of a grocery store; I just told her that it did not go as planned and that she should call me when she gets home. I had a full on melt down in my car after that. After collecting myself, I saw that the call was ongoing still, I joined and things had calmed down. Honestly, I don't remember this part as much, but we apologized about letting our tempers get the better of us and I told them that I still wanted to see them this summer. It wasn't until afterwards did I remember the horrible things that Harry said and I don't think I can forgive, much less forget it. Harry has not made any attempts to contact me since then and it has been a month or so. I am so exhausted and I feel alone. I thought I could depend on my brothers but it is becoming more and more apparent that they do not feel the same about me. Please, tell me your thoughts."
"I’m so fucking done.(I’m not a minor) Every time I leave town. My room is rearranged. It doesn’t sound like a big deal. But it is. Have you ever had your whole room rearranged and stuff in random drawers that wasn’t there originally? Have you ever had someone throw your own personal items away? It’s miserable. I don’t know how I’m going to leave I do have a lot of stuff and I already have 5 trash bags full and no where to go other than a hotel. My dad doesn’t talk to me at all despite living in the same home and it’s been like this for the last 10 years of my life. He blames it on me. But every time I’ve tried to talk to him or do something with him he turns me away. I’m done. I can’t take this anymore. It truly is miserable. They’re ultra conservative. Don’t know anything else than the US (Midwest) and Mexico where my mom is from. Anything else to them is horrible and gross and why would anyone want to go there? If I say I want to go somewhere they laugh at me and ask why I would ever want to leave here even if it’s just for travel. I’ve never felt so violated before. They make me so violent, and I’m not a violent person. Them making me this mad causes me to have the worst anger outbreaks where I start breaking and hitting everything I see. My walls are dented and so are my doors. I literally am so done. It is so hard staying alive. I’ve had two suicide attempts now that have just had me admitted. I usually do think things will change and they never do because it’s not just me it’s them too. They make me look fucking crazy to the rest of our family to the point where I don’t even want to be seen at any family event anymore. No one understands what it’s like to have your privacy compromised over and over again and to have your own parents shit on your dreams. And how miserable it is to live with your dad who refuses to speak to you despite the countless times you have made an effort to make him happy. Sorry for the rant. I’m worn out and no one understand. I’m tired. "
"i (17F) applied to some jobs online and i'm hoping that any one of then accept me, i applied to like 4 i think and i really hope one of them employ me

but in the mean time i need to figure out how to get away from my dad's house so i can actually work. he doesn't like it when any of his children work so that we're financially dependent on him and i hate it bc he always abuses yhat power and holds money over our heads.

like my brother was working while attending college and somehow my dad found out and he told my brother to pick. either my dad continues to oaynfor his tuition or my brother works and pays his own tuition... my brother had a part time job at a bookstore. 

and ik if i ask him to work he's gha make a big fuss abt it and i just can't rn. i planned to go to Mt mom's house so i cab work but she won't be there during the summer so she won't be able to drop me at work and idk how to navigate my way on the street either bc my dad doesn't let us out the house AT ALL. it's literally just school and home. 

i feel like i'm going mad bc i can't stay inside the house all summer. two fucking months in Mt room?!?!? i've been doing tat for the past how many months now and the only time i went outside was for school. i can't just sit in my room all day anymore. 

the plan is to go to school on friday bc rn we have exams and you only go to school when you have exams, friday is my last exam and my last time being outside the house if i stay w my dad. so i'm gna go to my moms house but thr thing is i had to ask my dad first but now he wants to take my little brother too. which he can't bc my mom won't be at her house during the summer so it would just be me and my little brother. my dad doesn't know she's leaving and i don't plan on telling him bc then i'd have to stay w him and that means staying in the house all summer.

i need to convince my little brother to not want to come but he's gna want to bc he hates my dad too. my dad shaved his head bald, UNEVENLY AT THAT. and sent my little brother to school and he got bullied for weeks for it.

but my brother just can't come or else everything will be ruined. 

idk what to do, there's so many problems and so little solutions rn:

1. idk how to navigate the road if i do get a job and i don't want to get lost or kidnapped
2. i need to convince my little brother to not want to come to my mom's 
3. i just can't do this anymore. "
"Hey guys, I just need some advice on my current situation. 

I (27F) am the eldest sibling of 3, my younger siblings are (25F) and (22M). I have a stressful job, though it pays me well and I'm working from home. We currently live with my parents.

Dad (67M) has always been abusive since I could remember. He used to be physically abusive, but as old age kicks in he became less physically abusive but got more violent with verbal assaults and verbal abuse. Mom (60F) has always tried to be understanding, tried to make peace between us, but dad only got worse and all three of us could not stand him. He would blame mom when things don't go his way, called us kids names in front of his friends and make up stories (such as calling us useless who only knows how to ask him for money, which never happened. He would also tell his friends how rude we are to him and disrespects him as a father, when all we do is tell him how rude he is when he calls us names like sl*ts, bast*rds, and curse us to get married to rap*sts when he doesn't get his way, so whenever he did that we only tell him that he is the one being rude and he describes that as 'being disrespectful' but doesn't elaborate so all his friends believes him). 

Dad also makes a mess of the house and expects mom to clean up after him. She works practically 7 days a week. I occasionally help with the dishes and housekeeping but there are days when I'm so exhausted from work I just collapse and fall asleep, I don't know how my mom managed to do this for years. As mom works too because dad refuses to cover the house expenses.

My sister (25F) is moving out with her boyfriend soon. I've also considered moving out but recently I got scammed and lost most of my savings, so I had hoped to stay at home another 3 years until I could build my savings back up. However, my main concern is that I'm unwilling to leave my mother and brother behind with my abusive father. My mother is unwilling to move out because she believes that she could get into legal trouble for abandoning my dad? But I truly believe this is beyond her responsibility, and she doesn't deserve the treatment my dad regularly gives her. We most certainly can sustain ourselves if we moved out, but my mom refuses to. She is already 60, and assuming that she lives up to 80, I don't want her to spend her last 20 years enslaving herself to my dad.

Work stress, along with family stress, the fact that I got scammed because I've been careless, losing 90% of my life savings, and having to cope with losing my pet recently who had been my only emotional support is slowly taking a toll on my mind. 

I considered therapy but decided I prefer to save the money, besides I can't think of anything a therapist can tell me that I don't already know. I'm perfectly capable of rational thoughts at the moment, but living has been very difficult.

My friends all have rather alright families so I thought I rather not burden them with my family problems since it's pretty heavy and they might not understand the level of abuse my dad is inflicting on us. 

Any advice or personal stories that could provide insights would help! I just need another perspective as I don't know anyone who went through the same level of abuse my family has. I'm just trying to make peace with myself and figuring out how to live with my current situation.... Probably until my dad dies of either old age or taken by illness."

"The abuse at home is getting to be too much, because nobody will believe me on what’s been happening at home, being abused at home has made me into a jerk. My mom abuses me and it’s verbal abuse, it used to be physical abuse but that stopped a couple of years ago.

Because one time my mom got mad, and threw me to the ground by my hair when I was 12 and I haven’t told anyone but here on Reddit. She used to beat me with belts, wooden spoons, and her hand and it hurt so bad. 

I was recently told on Saturday that my mom talks behind my back, to my sister and says mean things. My mom hates me because my sister was told that by my mom, and my mom calls me annoying. 

I want to leave but I can’t, because I don’t have the money and nobody is hiring that I can walk to. I just need love and support by the people who are supposed to be there, but they aren’t. My dad doesn’t want me he rather me be homeless than me go live with him, talk about a POS dad. 

I’m tired of being abused, a family friend who’s a lawyer was always worried about my siblings and I but he can’t do much because I moved to another state. Nobody loves me or wants me. "

"My therapist messaged me this morning asking if we can call later today.

 Little background, I started therapy without my parents being aware because of obvious reasons since I'm posting this here. She told me that she won't tell anyone anything unless she legally has to. Aka concern for my safety. She also told me she would talk to me before she does.

Id like to say I've had social services in my life vaguely twice and they just walked out again.

I think I said something in Thursday in my last session that could have caused concern for my safety and I can't see why she'd want to talk to me today and couldn't wait until our next session unless it's so she can call social services or the police or something.

I'm terrified. Social services makes my life 10x harder. I don't want to go through this again. TBF I've already got it all planned so if she is going to call social services I can leave the second the phone call ends. My friend said I can run away to her house if social services are called because they honestly put me in more danger in many ways (I am 16 btw) but just because I have that plan doesn't mean i won't be found.. and I'm honestly so terrified about that too. Also there are cameras around my friends house so I need to be really careful not to be spotted by them if I do run away. 

I'm terrified. I have been shaking all day. I've been trying to do studies and literally couldn't because I was too scared. I haven't eaten anything today either... Which honestly isn't that uncommon for me but still. I wanna cry 😭😭"
"My dad is very abusive and controlling, if anything that doesn't go like intended then he will start smashing and breaking things in our house like a child. He even forced me and my littler sis to follow his bullshit rules such as we have to smile whenever we're around him, if not he will ground us or even worse, he will beat us. He always threatens us with violence if we don't obey him. Violence for him is always the best solution. He always complains why didn't our house happy like the other families and will blame us for making this house NOT HAPPY when he's the problem. If your kids are always sad when they see you, why don't you ask them why or maybe put effort into understanding them, right?? He didn't do all of that because he himself is a selfish ass who always cares about himself, he forced us to be happy whenever he's around like I've mentioned, how can I be happy if I'm being forced?? Every day in this fucking house is like a constant mental torture for me.

Is there anything that I can do to keep myself safe from him? Thank you."
"Honestly no idea where to start maybe last year? 
Anyways what happened is my father forced me out of my apartment I lived in for 3 year after he and my younger sister moved in during covid because he lost his job. I know huge mistake but my sis was 14 and didn't want anything happening to her.

Fuck family fuck life fuck police, fuck canada"
"Hello all :) im 6thsense. I’m 17F (to be 18 in a short while) and I’ve been dealing with my mother for all my life (go figure!). 

A little background: I’m extremely fortunate for starters. My family is fairly wealthy, and I’ve lived a comfortable life since I was about 6-7. I have always had my needs met and my life is pretty damn good. I’m extremely lucky, yes. 

Although I will say that in some ways, the amount of cushioning I’ve had has left me with poor self support skills. I am unable to handle failure well, I am financially ignorant as I am unsure how to do many basic things. (Understand taxes, paying rent, budgeting, labor etc.) This is due to my parents trying to both shelter me, and keep me from being dependent on them— but that’s another story entirely. 

In any case, my family is alright for the most part. All families are in some form of dysfunction, and that’s pretty normal. My mother, on the other hand- wields the narcissist trifecta of gaslighting, hypocrisy, and verbal abuse. 

I, on a daily basis, have to put up with being called slurs, made to do things because she is incapable of caring enough to do it herself, and picking up her slack. She is also extremely hypocritical and expects so much from me, without delivering anything in return. My dad is a hard worker and is stressed non stop because of his job and taking care of us. 

I am also constantly having to deal with the destruction of my character and self esteem. I can provide answers and examples as needed, but I don’t want to vilify my mother. I love her very much, but as adulthood approaches, I’m becoming worried that if I don’t get into college, all financial support will be pulled from me because of her and me clashing constantly. 

I want to know: am I going crazy, or is my mom truly a narcissist targeting me???"
"So for a bit of context, I (22M) was a product of teen pregnancy, my parents split custody of me before I could even remember. 

The situation with my mom and step-dad was always horrific, but that's a can of worms for another day. On the other hand, my dad, while not flawless, served as a solid foundation for my upbringing. In hindsight, that's all I could have hoped for.

However, when I was around 13, my dad succumbed to severe drug addictions, transforming into a different person, monstrous in behavior.
 
Now that I'm an adult, I seldom interact with him, given his frequent incarcerations. Yet, when we do speak, it's like conversing with a stranger; he's changed beyond recognition from my childhood memories.

Before he was addicted, my father truly was an amazing single parent. Looking back I know he made so many sacrifices for me, I have so many cherished memories with him. 

Despite this, he now seems to have forgotten most of those moments, it's like my father had died and came back as this despicable persona wearing his skin; I can't even love the father he once was when I remember the years of abuse and terror he put me through for years. 

My grandparents and some other family members, still naively hold a hopeful outlook for their son; they even coerce me (with best intentions) into interacting with him.
But I've witnessed the cycle enough times to realize he won't change permanently, despite temporary periods of sobriety or freedom from prison.

He'll have my family fooled once more, and i'll have to force myself at a safe distance as I hear about how my dad is yet again back to his old habits, whilst also leeching off of my poor beloved (gullible) grandparents.
To be truthful, I dont think I will ever be ever to see him in a positive light again, Even if he were to clean up his act permanently.

Nothing, not even time is going to restore his drug corroded brain beyond the intellect and personality of a dangerous child. Nothing can make me forget the feeling of dread after getting home from school. Nothing can make me forget the pure psycotic episodes. 
Nothing can make me forget the fact you ruined my permanently and fundamentally tore my grandparents apart; nor the fact you were also abusive to my grandfather. Nothing can make me forget waking up to being dragged by my hair, out of my grubby floor spot at 4 am. Nothing can erase the permanent physical and mental damage from being choked and punched, nothing can ease the constant paronia and dread from being stalked after finally having enough legal evidence to emancipate

 I miss my father greatly, but that man is gone forever; yet I can't even mourn him

When I was younger-ish just a few years back I was filled with so much anger it was noticable and poisonous. I hateful towards him and vindactive to loved ones who tried to help me move on. I would fantasize about revenge now that I was older and stronger. 

Then he got nearly beat to death in prison, seeing him in that bedridden state broke me, his face and limbs were haunting, a jumbled mess of blood filled eyes, black splotches, bandaged wounds, disjointed features, and grotuesqly swollen features from literally being kicked into the ground.

I could never do that to him, or anything remotely close. I felt so incredibly guilty, this is what I had wanted for so long, but it wasn't. I didn't know what I wanted, I still don't, he was so frail then, and still is now. I don't doubt his life has been harsh in the recent years.

This was the man who did so much to support me through two bouts of cancer, I probably wouldn't have survived without him. This was the man who constantly stuck his neck out to act as my shield, against my mother's abuse and neglect, this was the man who would make me blueberry pancakes before school just to silently say 'I love you'.

Yet this isn't. He is not that man anymore. If he wasn't changed by his years of substance abuse, he was definitely changed by his head trauma. I had realized this during our most recent actual conversation some years ago, it struck me that this man was seriously disabled now as well as cognitively impaired. 

This may be the consequenses of his actions, but it is both disturbing and heart-rending to see the father I once admired go through such daily misery and bodily suffering.

I can't hold any resentment for this man anymore, hating him would be like hating a child. Substance abuse and head trauma has irreversibly altered him, leaving me with a lingering sense of melancholy and pity rather than resentment.

In conclusion, I often find myself wishing he had passed away peacefully long ago, sparing us both from this ongoing pain. It's a sentiment that fills me with self-hatred.

TLDR 
My dad's struggles with addiction have left him less than a shadow of his former self, and it's a source of profound sadness for me."
"A recent development through therapy that I’ve found about myself is that I’m absolutely terrified of being in a relationship. Platonic or romantic- I’m terrified. Growing up was chaotic. I lived a balance of abuse and neglect. When my parents were home, I was a frequent target for my moms emotional, verbal and occasionally physical abuse. My dad is a door mat who never stood up for us (myself, and older sisters who got out of dodge years before I could). But then they would leave for days starting when I was young. I had to become independent young. 

I don’t wanna trauma dump but I want to share enough to make this post make sense. Through this time I also witnessed my sisters be abused like I was. They had much different responses to the abuse then me. Where my oldest dove headfirst into a small group of friendships, my older sister was everyone’s friend and never was in the house. I saw her and my oldest sister get punished for creating these relationships, and frequently my parents would shame them to me about their relationships.  I coped through being the under the radar daughter, the doing sufficiently to pass but not gain too much attention for grades or other achievements daughter. I kept to myself and didn’t build relationships, romantic or platonic because I was trying to be invisible. 

I’ve been out on my own now for the last 5 years. I’ve grown so much and feel like I can at least hold a conversation and “start” a relationship but I have no idea how to build a healthy relationship. I know how to love others- I jokingly call myself a universal donor of love. I can give every type of love away. I just don’t know how to receive love or even how to create a loving relationship that actually will last. People terrify me but I don’t want to be alone forever. 

Anywho, if anyone is actually still reading this I’d appreciate if you could share advice, stories or tips 💜"
"Throw back to 2020. My husband at the time 22M and I 21F had just gotten engaged, graduated college, and began searching for houses. At the time, we were living with my parents. A little back story, back in college we had just bought a dog and were living in an apartment when we found it had mold. I was sick from it. My parents told me that my dog would die from it if we didn't leave and insisted we move in with them and commute 30 minutes to college. To which I agreed. I am their only child btw. I had a rough upbringing. I thought I was just rebellious but am realizing now they are control freaks. My dad told me when I was 16 that he put a gun to his head outside and almost pulled the trigger and it would have been my fault. My mom called me fat multiple times, forced me into pageants i didn't want to do. she saw my bf kissing me once and wouldn't talk to me for 3 months, couldn't even be in the same room as me or look at me without crying. Oh and she kept saying it's just my first wedding every chance she got. They both told me that being a labor and delivery RN is gay and that I would be a terrible nurse, but I have proved them wrong. There is much more in between all of this but here's some.

My husband and I were searching for houses, we were going to buy one when we told my parents we'd be moving out. They begged us to stay, said we could transform the garage into a living space and they would move out there. They said they would sign the house over to us. My husband was fond of the idea since he didn't want to live in a neighborhood and my parents have 10 acres. I was not fond of it, but knew we would save money in the long run. So we got a contractor and cashed out my husbands inheritance from his deceased father (he died when my husband was 18). I used all of my savings to help pay. It amounted to about 100k after everything.

As soon as we paid, my parents demeanor changed. They became rude and insensitive, saying all sorts of horrendous things. They began heavy drinking mid 2020 because my Grandma died and their life was over.

The drinking got worse, my dad called me a bitch for not wanting to pay $7k for painters. I told them we would paint it ourselves. It wasn't good enough for them. They have caused fights about us throwing out a paint can, screaming ""one hundred dollars isn't a lot to you but it is to us"" and proceeded to say they ""don't know how its going to work here"" and that they might just take us off everything. 

Flash forward to many stupid fights later, we are here and they haven't signed the house over. They claim they are trying to merge the property from my Grandma to their house then they will sign it over. We put an additional 50k into much needed upkeep that they fell short on for 30 years. I'm currently pregnant with our first two children.

We have had many fights over the dumbest shit. I could go into so many details but we would run out of space. They have made claims that we're taking advantage of them, how they've sacrificed so much and we haven't done anything for them. They blew their top over a paint can saying ""100 dollars isn't much to you but it is to us!"" They have threatened to not add us on the house and have said multiple times this isn't going to work. Even better my dad and mom refused to stop smoking and drinking around my babies because ""it doesn't affect them"". I used to visit every day before I got pregnant and was super sick. But now I visit once a week. But that seems to not be good enough.

It was my baby shower today. Keep in mind, my mom didn't throw me a bridal shower and claimed she was too busy with the renovation even though my husband and I were handling everything. She didn't offer to throw me a baby shower either. My husbands Grandma and my friend did.

Last night I texted my Mom saying that we would be leaving at 9. I figured we would be riding together since we live together and she is going to be a Grandma. Well, my mom ignored me and had my father text me. He told me that she won't be riding with me and she will be riding with a cousin. I told him I think that looks poor given she is the Grandma and shouldn't be arriving with other guests. He texted me saying my husband told him that we can't give my mom a ride. I know this is not true.

What happened was that my husband took the dogs out and at the time had a lot on his mind from work. My dad said my Mom will need a ride to the shower. My Mom insisted she didn't and would drive herself (their car is old and breaking which they have also insinuated that we should be buying them a car). My husband said that either way works and just let us know. Continuing, my father told me that he doesn't want to leave anything to us because of this. And I left it at that.

In the morning, my Mom texted saying she wants to ride with us which we agreed. She never apologized for the behavior or anything, just pretended like nothing was wrong.

My shower was less than ok. My entire family breezed past me, barely asked about my pregnancy or the babies and talked to my Mom. I sat in the corner with my friend and husbands Grandma while my Mom entertained all of them. She excluded my husbands Grandma from the main dining table and spent an hour talking about how hard her life is with my Dad and his health problems. ""Nobody knows what I go through"" she says. 

The shower basically felt like a show for her. My cousin said ""I heard you and (my Dad) built a tiny house. That must have been expensive."" My mom says ""yeah we did!"" I walked over and said that MY husband and I paid for it. it was asked why my husband and I aren't living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one. I told them it wasn't our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house.

My mom didn't sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after.

After the shower, everyone left and I said to my mom that I wasn't aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything. She screamed to of her lungs ""YOU can't KEEP DOING THIS TO ME!"" My husbands Grandpa definitely heard. So do you think she's in the right and has scarified more than I have?

  
I am getting tired of the threats and becoming more concerned that they will try to evict us even though we pay the gas, electric, wifi, and television bills. With these babies coming soon, I don't know what to do. It would bankrupt us leaving without our money back and buying a new house. Am I ungrateful and in the wrong? "
"ive kept a log of the shit they've done to me. from the time i was about 16 every singl eoffense ive documented (ashamed of myself for not haivng startred sooner.) anyway, those assholes never cared about disciplining me, theyve never cared about helping me, thjeyve never cared about my wellbeing, never cared about my gfuture. the only thing theyve ever done towards me was inflict pain on me for their own saidistic purposes. i hate those creeps, bullies, and pathetic people. it si unfair ive had to live like this. with a nbunch of creep asshole parents who have done everythign in their power to inflict pain on me for no reason. i hate them. i hate them. i hate them. i hate them. i do. "
"what the fuck. i'm so tired of the assholes.

yesterday night my egg and sperm donor were cleaning the kitchen. I came to warm some food and my nmother told me to clean the microwave. i said 'okay' to which my nmother started getting aggressive. she said that i was being very disrepsectful and having a bad attitude, 'stop the attitude' the eggdonor said. i told it that i wasn't having an attitude, i just said okay while going to grab the materials to start cleaning the micorwave. I was defneding myself against the narcissist's lies. but that was when nfather came in. it started screaming at the top of its lungs in my face then slapped me. it screamed ""EHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? HUH HUH? STOP HAVING AN ATTITUDE.""

When i started to cry because of the barbaric attack, the egg donor started recording me and said ""look at this grown woman cryiing all because we took her phone.""

What a gross non empathetic disgusting excuse for a human being. i didn't do anything them yet the egg and sperm donors keep harassing and attackin gme. this has been my whole life on a constant basis from when i was in middle school and beyond. for hours on end my egg and sperm dfonor harrassed and shouted and phuysically assualted me (often times on school nigfhts when id have to be up 4 hours later for class. it'\[s a miracle i got good grades). they couldn't go even every few weeks begfore harrassing, attacking and bullying me. doing the bare minimum and neglecting me whilst bullying me on top of it. taking away my phone for weeks for no reason just to hurt me. everything those asshoe fucks have ever done has been to hurt me. i will never forgive them. i will NEVER forgive them. i hate those  patehtic bullies. i only wish they werent such cowards so they could pick on someone their own size."

sorry if it is hard to read. im not really in the right space of mind right now. 

hi im 15F and im really considering calling the police.I dont really want to get into it too much as im really upset about what just happened but ill try to summarise everything.

I have abusive parents.Like parents that would strangle you and stab a pin into your neck if you accidentally reply to them with “what” instead of “yes dad”. I have a parent that literally sexual assulted me many  time, as young 9. Parents that forgot to feed me for three days before,they still forget to feed me half the time.Parents that makes fun of their own child for being bullied. Parents that takes sides and will beat you if you don’t apologise.

As i have just stated, my parents are clearly not in the right sense of mind. And homestly i had an interaction with them and im really scared they will hurt me like they did a couple of hours ago.And im also scared for my mental health, i have done multiple forms of self harm such as cutting myself(i have the scares on my leg),overdosing on paracetamol( i took enough to feel sick but not enough to hospitalise myself so my parents don’t find out),drank bleach multiple times to “punish myself” and i have also drank disinfectant. when drinking the bleach i was so close to killing myself, the only reason im still here is because there simply wasn’t enough bleach. 

I know i need help and honestly i don’t think i can wait until i move out because  i will end up hurting myself or my parents will. 


I need some immediate advise on what to do and i don’t want to  hear from anyone that i should communicate with my parents cus fuck them.


UPDATE: i plan on contacting childlime so they can help me witj the process

UPDATE 2: bro fuck childline, theyre not helpful at all. Like they seem more intrested in knowing my full name and adress rather than helping me"
"My mom pulled my hair really harsh intentionally today before I go out to eat at a restaurant with dad. She said that my acne looks really bad and my hair is messy, and she got mad at me for that. So she started combing my hair, it hurts for a little so I grabbed my scalp to prevent it from hurting and she got annoyed from that because it was in her way. And so she said something like 'is your scalp that valuable?' in a sarcastic manner and she just pulled my hair really harsh and yelled at me when I yelp as if she expected me to be quiet after pulling my hair really harsh. This is something she would always do, she would point out my every little flaw on my appearance when it's so obvious as if I don't know, I would often get scolded or I think is what I want to call bullying by my own family members, they will continue on and on mocking me and I would act as if it was nothing and take it as a joke. But I think it's also my own fault for having really bad acne, my mom bought me some products for my skin care and I swear I use it. I thought that my skin has gotten better than before but my mom still kept calling it disgusting and ugly. She likes to comment on my body, pointing out how fat I look, I'm 5'3 tall and is 55-57 kg.
I take her 'insult'(I guess) as a thought of her caring about me, despite the harsh things that she does on my body.
I'm not sure about how I should feel about my mom, she can be so sweet sometimes yet get mad at me for everything and I'm trying my best to be a good daughter. And I don't really have anyone else to turn to or talk about my mom to(a little bit of personal information of the reasons why), I'm very worried to talk to my dad about my mom, because he's one of the person that I really hate the most in my life, and he's divorced with my mom and so I'm afraid that if I talk about my mom with him, he would get her into some kind of trouble. And I also don't want to talk to my brother about how I feel too, because I think he definitely doesn't understand how I feel and what I think and we've never talk about something like this to each other anyway. And with my other family members like grandparents and uncle, trust me, I've tried telling them many times but they ended up telling my mom about what I say to them or ended up being on my mom side and also telling me to listen to her."
"like they say shit like do you know that we had to take a loan for this fridge,this computer cost 1000 pounds etc like hwy"
like im in foster care and they keep saying when you come home... like why would i want to come to your abusive household anways 
lmao
"Hey guys I also suffer from the abuse of my parents. They take advantage of my mental illness and the fact that I am completely dependant on them. I want bad things to happen to them as they have robbed my teenage years of any joy. Text me for details, I can provide links, names, license plate, working place. I would even pay you to badly hurt them. I think people like these should not get away with their actions. They have repeatedley abused me and have knowingly caused my mental state to deteoriate. This is your opportunity to make the world a better place"
"Okay so this may seem weird but its like. A genuine thing i've been struggling with. Warning i don't have a lot of memories so if she has like.. done anything severely bad so me i will NOT remember

But Uh basically i'm a teen, Lived with her all of my life, My dad is out of the picture and for an extremely good reason. I know shes extremely emotionally abusive, Always yelling, blaming stuff on us, Getting mad at me (Oldest in the house) in particular.

She also let me start smoking at 15? Uh. she threatens physical abuse, Shes let my uncle (whos long moved out) >!`Burn my brothers hands with lighters and hit them`!< As well as shes >!hit me!<a couple times, but not badly. Just like a cuff around the head nd shit, As well as she doesn't really get painkillers anymore (ngl could be my fault) but i deal with extreme migraines (got them from her) as well as un-diagnosed knee issues (also from her) and she never gets painkillers no matter how much i beg her to

She also lets me and my brothers get into physical fights, and by that i mean they have >!kicked my knee out as well as nearly fractured my arm!<, Both of them are younger then me and both have severe mental health issues which they are on pills for but my mother simply reminds them and then moves on with her day and gets mad when they don't take them. She doesn't stop the fights and i do not initiate the fights because.. well i'm almost 18, My brothers are four years younger. 

Thats all I can remember but like.. Yeah. I just wanna know because my friend says she does, But i honestly don't think so but could that just be me in denial? "
"i (18y) have been abused by my parents and grandparents for as long as i can remember. my first memory is my grandad approaching me as i was sat down on a potty (one of those weird plastic toilets toddlers have) and picking my up by my shoulders. he screams something at me before he puts me down and slaps me across the face. i was about 3 years old. i feel the best way to talk about this lifetime of abuse is to tell it in chronological order from the best of my ability (my memory surrounding certrain things is hazy as for a while i tried to forget as much of this as i could)

  
firstly i think its important to give some information about my mum and dad. my dad was 17 when i was born and i believe my mum was 21. he lied to her about his age. my dad is addicted to weed and i know for a time he was addicted to coke too. i remember he would often get arrested a lot. he would also say he was leaving us but return hours later very clearly off his face on coke and whatever else. my mum is a very manipulative and emotionally abusive woman. when i was 7, i witnessed her kiss another man in front of me. we later on found out that they had been seeing each other for ages behind my dads back. i havent been able to forgive her for that. it's also important to note i have many siblings (i wont say how many as i have already given a lot of telling information and do not want my family to know ive typed and posted this, many of my family members use reddit). 

  
from the age of 5, i remember getting beatings almost daily from my mum or dad. these would be for the most minor of things such as forgetting to flush the toilet or turning the tv up a little bit too loud. these weren't little taps either, i got fully manhandled and punched. often i remember my dad pinning my down so my back is facing upwards, he would hold my hands around my back while my mum would hit me on my ass until it was red raw. no one can justify that. sometimes it wasn't always my parents though. sometimes they would call my grandad. for such a long time the word grandad evoked so much fear in me. when i was told he was coming over i would run to my room, but on as many layers of clothes as i could and hid under my blanket. when he arrived, he would berate me about how much of a disgusting little cunt i was before he would punch me in my face and all over my body. often i would have bruises as a kid, i dont know how teachers at school didn't pick up on it. i remember one Christmas eve my xbox account wasn't working (cant remember why) and this understandably upset me, i was 8 after all. my dad called my grandad over, and i did the same routine. clothes on, over the covers and pray he doesn't hit me too hard this time. this time was different though. he came into my room and pulled me out of my bed by my arm and threw me down the stairs. i ran into the living room where my nana was. she slapped me in my face so hard i fell to the ground. i tried to run out of the room only for my grandad to push me back into it. i was made to sit on the couch while i got called the most horrific names. i was so scared i wet myself and couldn't stop shaking. i was 8 years old. 

not long after Christmas, it was my birthday. i got disney infinity and a bunch of the little figures to go with it. for months this was my hyper fixation, i would play it daily and completed everyone one of the story set things i had. one day my grandad came over, and he started his usual borage of insults. he turns to my organized disney infinity figures resting upon my xbox 360 (jesus im old) and kicks them all over just avoiding the xbox. he then turns around and leaves. he broke so many of the figures, i cried for hours and hours in my room alone. no one came to check on me. the figures being broken hurt so much more than the beatings i was now used to. 

  
from this point onwards, things are a little fuzzy. i move house a few times and am now in secondary school. im 13 years old, and questioning my sexuality heavily. i get into fights both inside and outside of school and have started smoking cigarettes. the physically abuse had stopped, but the emotional abuse had got worse. at the time i was a very fat kid. i would eat to feel better. my dad would often call me fat and insult me for everything i did. every song i played, booked i read and film i watched. he would rip into me daily for no reason at all. he would often say if i wasn't his kid and he saw me when he was a kid he'd beat the fuck out of me. when i was 15, life started to get a bit better. i found a group of friends that liked me, i was no longer questioning my sexuality and was fully comfortable saying i was pan-sexual. i also started to smoke weed with my best friend, which has given us some of the best memories. in the summer of that year, we got evicted from our home and had to move into an emergency house. this was hell, and one of the worst times of my life. i slept on the couch and my pc was in the kitchen where often my little siblings would throw food on it and try to tip if over. my parents did nothing to stop this. the insults still followed and i was made to feel so insignificant and small. the most i slept in the 4 months we lived there was 5 hours a night. one time my dad was berating me and he got in my face because i said something back to him. he pinned me against the wall by my t shirt. for the first time, i felt all of the rage i had kept bottled up since i was a kid overflow and i punched him square in the face. he fell back and looked at me in shock. my mum rushed to his defense and screamed at me to leave. i left for a few hours until my dad called me and told me to come home. we haven't spoken of it since. 

  
now i am 18. i am in the last few days of college then im off to university. the emotional abuse still continues and there are so many things that im leaving out for the sake of length. i could genuinely write a novella about all of this shit. i am not sure what to do moving forward. i really want to block them out and live my life peacefully and free. however, whenever i think about doing this i feel really guilty. luckily i have an amazing and supportive partner who is helping me make sense of all of this. the scars still feel fresh. for anyone who is in a similar situation but has years to wait before they can leave, keep your head up. right now i know it is hell and it seems like there is no end. my best advice is find something you love and cling onto it, passion is found in the darkest of place. in my case, it was films. you are not crazy or being sensitive, it is abuse. 

  
any question feel free to ask, thank you for listening.

  
EDIT: sorry if some of this makes no sense im dyslexic haha "
"yung father ko ay want niya yung parenting na nasa kanya yung power. yung ipinagmamalaki nga niya, military type daw siya.

nanginginig ako habang tina-type 'to. I've been experiencing physical violence from him several times. Binatukan nang malakas, binato ng upuan, pinahiya sa labas, at madami pang iba. normal na rin siguro sa akin yung word na ""papatayin kita"".

ngayon, sinabunutan niya ako. ang sakit ng ulo ko. why? because hindi ako bumaba nung tinatawag niya ako para magsimba. alam niya ba kung bakit hindi na ako nagsisimba? because I keep on asking God bakit ko nararanasan ang pain 'to from him mismo. sa kaniya ko dapat nararanasan yung comfort. yung safety. 

pero no. tuwing umuuwi siya, ang nararamdaman ko ay takot. baka saktan niya ako... ipahiya...

alam kong hindi ako perpektong anak. madami din akong mali pero... deserve ko ba talaga 'to? 

yung physical pain kaya ko pa. pero yung emotional? ang tagal kong nagtiis. sobra. pagkatapos niya manakit, hindi ako umiiyak sa harapan niya. iniiyak ko iyon kapag mag-isa nalang ako. I've been fighting alone.

sabi niya sa akin kanina pagkatapos niya manakit, ""ngayon, alam mo na kung sino ang tatay.""

oo pa... at hindi kayo 'yon."
I have extreme anger when I get flashbacks of my dad making an angry face grinding his teeth while holding me in the air against the wall when I was 4. I can’t stop obsessing fucking beating him up and making him cry for what he did to me. Ive been having these thoughts all day I just wanna fucking kill him. Please help me I dont know how to get rid of this feeling I think Im permanently damaged and I will never be happy because my dad destroyed my childhood with his alcoholism. He died of colon cancer when I was 17 and I am 27 today. I cant believe that selfish fucker got to make up with his dad before dying while leaving me alone and never apologizing for what he did. Im so fucking angry Im gonna fucking snap and end up killing someone if this anger doesnt stop

"My Autobiography

From my earliest memories, my father has been a harsh figure in my life. I recall years of abuse, mockery, and physical punishment, including beatings with a belt. One vivid memory is when my cousin bit me, and my father praised him, celebrating his actions. Another painful moment was when he tried to abandon me during a time I was possessed. He criticized every action of mine, and my childhood is filled with memories of constant family fights.

When I was just 4 or 5 years old, he would distinctly say that he wouldn’t include me in his will. I had no understanding of money at that age, but the fear was real. His angry glares terrified me, and I lived in constant fear of doing something wrong that would lead to further abuse. He would kick me out of the house and demand the clothes off my back because he had paid for them.

At 11, I was sent to a hostel, despite my desperate pleas to stay. My mother cried her eyes out, but my father showed no emotion. His frustration with me was so intense that even when I made a harmless joke, he would get angry, only to repeat the same joke himself moments later. My sister pointed out the hypocrisy, but it didn’t change anything. As I grew up, my hatred for him deepened. He frequently kicked me out of his business and his house. If not for my mother, I don’t know where I’d be. I eventually found a job and was given a month to leave his house.

I started my own business and helped him set up a new shop. My marketing efforts paid off, but I never received any appreciation. Instead, I was always compared to others. Despite swallowing my hatred as advised, his constant taunts cut deep. I was treated like a plague in my family, avoided like a germ. 

When you are unloved in childhood, you search for love to fill that void. I did the same. After seven years in a hostel, I finally found someone who liked me at 16. However, the relationship didn’t last. I left a prestigious university because of my depression, which led to more taunts and ridicule from my father.

I always wanted to learn to drive and begged him for a driver’s license. His response was dismissive, suggesting I should become a driver to earn some money. I tried to build a bond with him, and things seemed to get a little better. I contributed financially to his business without making any losses, but any minor issue would result in a torrent of abuse. Despite bringing in thousands of rupees each month, I received a fixed pocket money of just 15k rupees. Eventually, I stopped taking any money from him.

During a period of depression, I found love again. For three years, I was happy, but then she cheated on me, and I lost everything. Now, I am heartbroken, holding onto the hope of a miracle. 

Please, Dad, stop abusing me. If you want, I will disappear. I can’t take this anymore. Stop."
"They contacted my school and the school talked to me, I asked that they tell cps to contact me before anyone else.
It's been 2 weeks and they haven't contacted me yet.

I've tried to talk to my mom about my dad but she  ""forgot"" and now there both getting worse.
"
"I’ve lost so many nights of sleep over this trying to make sense of something so heartbreaking and evil. I try to see things from both sides . A mother and a son. It’s all so complex and complicated . 
You see people will tell on themselves people will tell the truth even when they think they are lying …if you pay close attention to every word spoken…the truth will always be right there. 
From the very beginning there were red flags …things that were said that just didn’t seem right….and it got worse and worse the little things said  became cry’s for help. God blessed me with a gift sometimes it can feel more like a curse. I can feel others feeling I can see things before they happen I get warnings and messages. Most times they are 100% correct and small about of times I get information tangled. 
I could feel his fear I could feel his confusion I could feel his dedication to someone who should have been sacred to him but betrayed him with the worst kind of betrayal. I could feel your fear I could feel this absolute control you have sunk your teeth into. For future reference I’m going to list how it all came together. 
It’s started with him telling me how hot he thought his mother was .
Then when I knew he was avoiding you for no reason and not telling you he was dating
Then he told me about a conversation the two of you had
How you CONFRONTED him about seeing someone and his response was YOU ARE SEEING SOMEONE TOO. 
That is not a normal exchange of words between a mother and son. 
Once you knew YOUR behavior said a lot. The constant calling the phone conversations that lasted hours. The constant texts “hablame” 
Yes mothers worry and call but not like that. 
Then finding out you never did his paperwork for citizenship but you did your other two sons. That right there showed your fear and tight grip you have held onto him. Showed how an abuser controls there victim. Then the text messages…the inappropriate things said . 
Then seeing family photos …”a picture can say a thousand words “ that saying rang true. The body language was off . The pictures didn’t look like a mother and her sons it looked like a mother father and son.
Then watching the interactions between you and him and the way you looked at me . Then watching him interact with his “baby brother “ he didn’t know how to be a father and a brother and it all felt so awkward. 
He remembers every detail of when his “baby brother”  was born 
Yea people remember stuff about siblings but the in depth details he speaks of are of a parent. 
Then the timeline of it all. 
You leaving his father with him and his brother and coming to %^*%#} and during high school (right when you got pregnant with his “baby brother” you sent him away to live with his father in another state. ) 
It was your shame and fear of people finding out and if he was not around you could pretend it never happened and date a man who thinks he had a child with you. When moving back things were only normal for him for a short period before you started your abuse again. 
…..to be continued "
"Like the Title says, my mother is neglectful and abusive

I'm a 19 year old, I just recently moved in with my aunt after my mom kicked me out for struggling to get a job

Living with my mom was hell, her apartment is infested with bedbugs, she sits on her ass all day, smokes pot then bitch and complain

Dcs was recently at my mom's due to something Involving a ex brother, day before all that happened she was screaming at me that my siblings were gonna get taken away basically blaming me

When I was living with her I became depressed more than normal and had thoughts of self ending, only reason I didn't go through with them is due to my 7 year old brother

I need melatonin to sleep really badly, I asked her multiple times because if not my insomnia makes me stay up all night, fall asleep at 2 am then sleep to 2 pm

She would get pissed off at me for sleeping all day when it isn't my fault. I genuinely tried to get a job but no one would hire me

She let's other people come over possibly infecting there clothes with bedbugs"
"How can I do my mother figure (grandma) leave an abusive relationship? ik this subreddit isn't exactly about that, but I'll explain better.

She's not the only one he's abused, i am constantly verbally abused everytime they fight he tries to include me, and blames me for it. 

The last time they broke up he punched her in the face, and for better context we have a really supportive community, but they'll PROBABLY not help us anymore if she gets back with him.

Before he did that, he tried to beat me and even punched my room door (it's not made of wood or nothing too heavy) while i was in bed studying, so it almost hit me. My bed is literally close to my door and he knows it. 

Do you guys have any advice for what i could do to make her not stay with him? I'm planning to get on my knees tomorrow and beg for her not get back to him since ik they'll be back soon (she's already drinking with him after days and it's just a matter of time).

I can't go to my mother's home(she has a lot of kids, they do not have enough space, and I'll lost all my friends, and she'll probably not have enough resources to let me finish my studies), my father lives with us but he's not strong enough to protect me and he's also a drug addict (abusive).

I just need advices that really helped anyone in the same situation as me. I don't care if they're not healthy advices.

"Behaviors of my dad that confuse me between abuse or normality 

^^^^^^

Calling out their abuse = “I’ll show you what real abuse is”

Calling them a bully = “I’ll show you what a real bully is”

Crying = “I’ll give you a reason to cry”

Making fun of less fortunate friends ( friends who live in trailer parks, little money, divorced parents, etc. )

Yelling, screaming, throwing things, on a near constant basis

Hitting ( not all the time, and it is a ‘joke’ or ‘playful’ )

Not being able to figure something out, then live-streaming me crying as I attempted to figure it out

Slapping me on the butt ‘playfully’ or to ‘show affection’ even after I asked him to stop

Purposely aggravates me and gets mad when I have a reaction

Making do work on a farm for hours on end/coming up with new or unnecessary chores so I can’t take naps/play games or use my free time ( essentially taking all my free time )

Has woken me up on multiple occasions screaming and yelling ( After this happened twice I now wake up at footsteps, doors opening and closing, or hearing someone yell while I’m asleep because I am afraid it’s him coming to wake me up )

Physically ripped my door off its hinges for sleeping with the door locked ( he broke the lock and ripped the hinged off in the process )

Threatened to take my door for not cleaning my room ( it isn’t very messy but I have very severe episodes where I can’t get out of bed for days unless he physically rips me out of bed )

Took my hand that was holding a loaded gun ( I didn’t want to shoot and was crying ) and he unloaded the entire may directly on the ground infront of my feet and yelled at me

Constantly compares me to other people 

Makes fun of my body and then denies ever doing so

When I tell him off for being rude he either yells at me or laughs and says “are you on your period” or something along the lines

Won’t get me diagnosed for ADD ( not self diagnosing but I’m 99% sure there is something wrong with me ) but he always gets mad at me for having symptoms 

Yells at me for talking to much/asking questions and now I’m deathly afraid of asking questions to people especially in cars because he yells at me in the car the most and almost crashed because he was occupied while yelling

^^^^^^

Just a few things that my dad does that confuse me a bit, I might do another post with more things but I didn’t wanna make it too long



"
"I’ve (26F) been no contact with my father (44M) for 6 years now but found out two days ago that he has been sexually abusing his girlfriend’s kids. The girl that my dad has been sexually abusing has apparently been in and out of rehab and mental institutions and just barely turned 18. He has been in this girls life since she was 12 years old. Her sisters described an incident in which they walked in on my father with his pants down and his hands in her underwear as she was sleeping. My father had raped my mother repeatedly in her sleep towards the end of their marriage so this was not entirely news to me. I never thought my dad was capable of sexually abusing a minor like that and it has made me question my childhood. When I first started to try and have sex I realized that I have a sexual disorder called vaginismus, which could stem from sexual abuse. I have no recollection of being sexually abused as a child, but with all that has transpired I’m starting to think my dad may have hurt me as well. My heart hurts for the girls that he has sexually abused and I hope they are able to press charges. I’m not sure how to come to terms with the guilt I feel, as if there was anything I could have done to stop him from hurting others. If you have had something similar happen, how did you come to terms with it?"
"Here are some of the comments my mother LOVES to make:
- You’re nothing without me
- Nobody will ever love you like me
- Nobody will be there for you except me
- No one will ever love you like that (talking about my physical appearance)
- I’ve done EVERYTHING for you
- I have given up my life for you


Whenever I do something she doesn’t like, she either tells the pastor of our church, my friends, and/or says things like:
- You can’t leave (the house) cuz if you ever leave, you’ll be leaving in disobedience and God does NOT act in disobedient children.
- You should always honour your parents.

Currently, my a/c is the only functioning a/c in the house. She sleeps in my bed and I sleep in a mattress on the floor.

She always twists the narrative so that she’ll be the victim in every situation.
So, for example, if I say:
“Today was tiring at work.” 
She’ll start ranting like:
“You should see me. You can at least sleep 10 minutes (I can’t), but I can’t. I have to do this and that, etc.” (keep in mind that I currently have two jobs, she has one; but even if I only had one job, it’s not a competence of who has it worse in my opinion).

She will also make lies and make them so believable that even she will start believing them.

- How dare you say that? I have NEVER told you that.
- That NEVER happened.
- You misunderstood the situation.
- You’re right! Everything is MY fault and I am a terrible mother. The worse mother ever.

Am I overthinking things or is she really manipulating me/gaslighting me?

"This will be a long read I'm sorry and formatting might be terrible sorry
I'm trying not to break down crying what I write this

My mom was also abused as a child I'll make the short but she got pregnant Young and her mother got pregnant very young fat my mother was raised to buy other people except for grandmother she also wants thought physical abuse and Parentification

As far as I can think back before I was 10 my mother would use Corporal punishment the problem was not the hit when I did wrong be how far she would go it would leave mark and sometimes I would bleed. I DON'T KNOW THAT'S A I REALLY REMEMBER what's that she thought I a child under the age of 10 smaller then her in both high and weigh ( she is obese I was a little overweight) try to push her I didn't do Such a thing and she pushed me so hard that I hit my head well she was still hiting me with her favorite belt (it was leather and had a key at the end of it that how to fake diamonds in it which was most likely made of glass), when I was 12 I was walking behind her try to get my phone back through communication she turn around tackled me down and when I tryed to push her off she Bit my index finger the day after my principal found out as I had an emotional breakdown she was close to call him the CPS of my country I don't remember what I said but I somehow confinster that it was a fine. Her favorite punishing was kicking me out of the house I was not even a pretty when she's not in kicking me out for things such as leaving something on the floor you keep me out for hours or even a day and I would have to cry to some random neighbor to please let me stay under the roof she also did this recently about a year ago and this time I was actually willing to leave the house I was close to running away until she decided to play the victim I'm giving the head of myself sorry she will often searching me or shame me for overeating any times I could just stop eating purposely try to get anorexia because I thought mom would like me better and she would constantly act like this to other people as well she would make fun of people that are really skinny or just smaller then her either by saying that the person looks like they do cheated wall and then practically Force feeding them whenever they come to our house stating that someone is a pig and because I lived with her the longest and I stayed without the longest I got most of these ones, when I was a kid there was a specific neighborhood I would have to go there was a lot of ""weird people"" for example after age I started puberty very early I had D cup at the age of 11 a man straight up ask me how much it would be to buy me for marriage (to be more specific it's a cultural thing where the husband gets the bride's family a specific amount of money to be able to marry the woman) this incident was the first time actually so my mom doing something really amazing for me there was also another guy double creep me out and say really suggestive comments my mounted nothing about that guy constantly just said he needs help and let it alone until my uncle decided to take it into his own hands. On the time when I was I think about 12 I was interested in adult books I would listen to the audiobooks and one day my mother found out instead of telling me that this was not okay to do at my age she decided to also tell me that she was r worded honestly make me so disgusted off sex that I would want to vomit if I thought of it. Now on it starts to get worse at 13 I had to do home schooling because my mom was relocating I was losing my friend it's not to tell my mom that I hate it to a random I started reconnecting with my also abusive father the funny thing is my mom calls him abusive but they also have the same personality are you eventually just cutting off due to something so you decided and by I decided my mom decided and the things he did was to my mom try to make her pay for his other children's things he has 7 children including me yes he did sleep around since then I never had a good mental health I constantly contemplated ending things and I constantly had the chance to this time I was in hospital for a it's significant growth in my brain the only way I could communicate with friends what's through messaging and emails that because I was not allowed to have those things due to the growth I lost content with almost all my friends except for one for so long i had no one and my mother never made things better everyday she would start a fight and even if you keep quiet and don't respond to her she would continue degrading you there was a hair stylus double come to my house and she would stay for just 2 days she must have my sister saying that my mom is straight up abuser and she wants to cut her of my mom will constantly diagnose me a psychological liar a sociopath a narcissist and tell me that I'm the abusive one she would hate me to the point where we can turn to Black and Blue one day she found out that I've been trying to kill myself she tries to help me out and I try to build a better relationship between us think so seem to be going well and so she decided to say that ""you just  trying to kill yourself because I had punished you I'm just trying to raise you to become a good person"" that was the day I realized I do not have a mother I try to kill myself because I've been pulling my whole life I lost all my friends I don't have friends I recently had to cut off my dad and it's not worse because one of the side effects for a pill I am taking what's literally thoughts of self-harm. she have to making me feel like a sorry excuse for human being by saying that I didn't tell the psychologist anything about her doing all these terrible things cuz I was afraid that CPS will take me she said that I wanted them to take me fast from repeat she declined and I haven't had therapy in one year now I can feel myself slowly regressing and losing all the work I put in for my mental health what makes things even back to the reason kicking out incident but happened a year ago the whole human started with her stating that maybe you deserve to be bullied turn to dad then she said I'm catching you out of my house because you decided you can be your own parent I leave and I try to go to my sister's dormitory she eventually find out that I'm talking to my sister and trying to get there and she starts playing up the water works she only wanted me to come back I'm so that I can give her the things that I took with me which was my laptop and my phone tell me eventually had a conversation and I'm told her that she is emotionally unavailable as well as the fact that she is a workaholic and excuses always that she has to save lives ( nursing manager the two nursing managers at the hospital). There was more I should have mentioned but every time I brought something up she would twist actually I just went to my room and then she decided to call family members and say that I thought she was that and fake tears. That was also the day I found that she would tell family members about how terrible of a child I am even though those family members do not think I'm horrible person she was twist a stories and say ""all I'm trying to do is raise her I'm a single parent you know"" even more to mention she always drinks alcohol everyday sketches always a very mean when she drinks alcohol as well as the faction ever has time for her children because of work and outside she is but she has time for everyone else. She's financially abusive towards my sister my sister's not blooded towards me but rather make you a adult adoption  originally cheat not believe that was abusers this is not my story to tell but I would just say that you promises to pay something back you pay for it you do not keep the money back but you use your lost money for that cycle continues oh she would take away the money that you search you would pay you back because she did not like that you said no you can't do this I'm currently in a private school I originally came from public schools everyone at that school is rich and honestly they make fun of you for everything I don't like it there and I hate the fact that I only have one okay friend and she doesn't even talk to me that much  everyone else is not even a genuine friend 
who is just like bully and I have to deal with them because there's only seven children in my class


Recently today she beats me I'm so badly that my left and right arms what numb and red for the past the couple hours why did she hate me because I do not say mom at the beginning of every sentence I say it as the second word  and she officially said that I realize I don't have a child you dripping like a ghost and outreach you like a ghost you always have food and water but just never talk to me and honestly I never felt any emotions about that I'm happy and she decided that I'm not a daughter anymore cuz a long time ago I realized that she was not my mother but just the person I have to deal with for 18 years 

My plan
As soon as I turn 16 out of sign up for a job my school is really close to a shopping center and it gas station so I can try get it more time job over there my mom has my savings card so I have to try by the way to get paid either in cash or something this is for me to save up for Law school or just in case I have to redo a year cuz I truly believe that at 18 she will believe I will no longer be her responsibility if  worst come to worst I'll just join the army . By I will cut her off 
Edit
I want that I could have asked to let me stay with her she's in a different city and she already has two kids which is the only thing I'm worried about but I would want 100% get important job so that she doesn't have to worry too much about me"
"Me (F17) so quick story me and my pal where messing around at the bus station and just tagging the place up and my ex boyfriend which is very abusive and manipulative, he saw me and my pal at the bus station just tagging up the place we started shouting his name my pal had his bike so he went and spat on him, I herd him shouting and chasing after me he grabbed me by the wrists very hard and started screaming and threatening me in my face. And then he told me dad he told me to come home and get my stuff and said I'm not allowed to come back and am kicked out. And he was saying I'm never allowed to come back I'm the worst daughter and I should die etc. and when I got out the door he slammed the door and told me to fuck off and never come back. So I got the last bus to my mum's, which was 2 long coach journeys 1 was mostly on the A9 good citylink bus I have to say had a working toilet and USB. I thought my mum's was going to be okay until she started screaming and threatening to kick me out if I never cleaned her mess and do dishes I arapently made when it was hers. She was constantly keeping me awake blasting music when being drunk she was a violent drunk she hit me and threatened to kick me out and locked me out, not letting me see friends and wanting me to avoid Dundee, it's only safe city if yk it well. But I did take a overdose and a few days later she told me aunt she's kicking me out and talking shit behind my back. My aunt said shes kicking me out, so I went mental at her told her to fuck off. Packed my things and left. She followed me to the bus stop she is a slow walker (am fast at walking) I was walking to the bus stop but missed the bus but waited 7 mins for another one, got on the bus seen my mum trying to get me off the bus but I told her to fuck off. She reported me missing not even 3 minutes on the bus polis pulled my bus over by the train station on a main road. And I had no place etc. so I asked my pal to stay with her and I'm staying their the now. Her mum is a foster carer been living here for a month happier and safer down here.

 But people are telling me my dad is wanting me to go back to his and arapently he didn't kick me out and he said wanted me to leave for abit, ive blocked both parents and idk what to do"

Hello everyone am a 19 year old female and I grew up in an extremely toxic household. In the past and up till now I have tried to take my own life many countless times. By intaking pills and cutting myself. My parents are very aware of this and reply with go ahead take your life, in other works they do not care one bit.we had the police knock on our door saying we heard abuse goes on in this house but me and my siblings where forced to stay silent and say nothing to them. My brother has previously ran away but came back after two days.my father hits me regularly, does not let me go out, talk to friends or anything. I have not had a mobile phone up until recently and could not have a social life with my school friends. This is only the surface of tube story in real life it’s so much worst and pretty much hell , despite that I tried living with it the best I could until my parents forced me into a marriage with a 40 year old man, he looks older than my own father. I pleaded with my parents so much crying on my knees and they refused no for an answer, they said you either marry him or go back to our home country and marry someone worse. I asked them to atleast show me his pictures and they refused instead they showed me his picture when he was in his 20s. When knowing I could not escape this I was slowly convincing myself and seeing he was a good guy until I realised what good is there in a guy that had an eye on me since I was 15 and can see I am very unhappy with the marriage. So I was forced to get married and now we are married on paper , I have received my dowry of 4k worth of gold but we have not yet moved in together or spoke properly. Forgot to mention that he speaks our native language which I barely understand and has a humour of a literal granpa. 
So I have had enough and I am deciding to run away with the dowry money that I have. If I ever get caught I will probably and literally be killed and beheaded for shaming the family. I don’t know where to go yet from the uk and how I am going to live. I don’t really want to live so I either run away and unalive myslef here or in another country. Am writing to hear any of ur experiences running away and what u needed and didn’t need. 
Also I am planning to go somewhere really far outside Europe if u know any cheap living English speaking countries let me know please and wish me luck.

"Hello,

I am f23 and unfortunately come form a long line of child domestic violence. My cousins family is no acceptation to this. She is a sassy little 14 y/o and I love her so much. She reminds me of my own sisters and we have gotten pretty close as of late. I have noticed that her family scapegoats her, gaslights her, and emotionally abuses her. Recently, she opened up to me about how her sister s\*xually abused her. I told her about my history with s\*xual abuse in my family and it was a really tender moment for both of us. I know that her brother and mom know about it so I assumed that her older sister did. She told me about how her and her sister that abused my 14 yo cousin will be moving in together. I expressed how I was uncomfortable with that and accidently let slip the their biggest family secret. My little cousin just called angry telling me that I betrayed her and not to report it. I am torn and did not want to betray her trust but at the same time I want her to get the help she needs with this. I know she struggles with it on a day to day basis. I am sad at the fact she is so angry with me. Any advice?"
"To start off, this talks about very serious issues I have been dealing with regarding my feelings and relationship with her. So read if you want. 

I genuinely do not love my mom. I know it is so evil saying this, but I do not love my mom. My parents divorced when I was 4, resulting in me going to my dads every weekend and coming home to my mom on weekdays. My earliest memories are of my dad leaving me with a new woman every weekend because of his serial cheating issue. He also became an alcoholic, leaving me at Kids Quest a lot to stay at the bar. As I grew older he began drinking more and coming home wasted, which made me have to take care of my younger siblings by lying saying he was just so exhausted from work, etc. One day in California, he got really drunk and got physical with a family member. I had to hide my siblings and I in the bathroom while he tried to find us to drive back home (a different state.) But even after all of this, I understood addiction is a nasty leech and knew that he loved us, he was just hurting.  Eventually, He found a nice woman and introduced us to her and her kids, and have been together for years since. He got better and doesn’t drink nearly as much anymore, and genuinely seems at peace. After all of that, I don’t hate him, I love him. Yeah we don’t really talk when I go over anymore but that’s just because I grew up completely different than him and we don’t have a lot to talk about. But I still love him. My mom was evil to me growing up. I remember being a kid and having suicidal thoughts, like, around age 8. I got severely depressed at 11, resulting in me going to therapy and psychologists. I was too scared to begin medication so I chose not to, and because of that, I blamed me lacking love toward her on that for so long. I know that is not the case. There were days when she’d care so much and make sure I’m ok, then the next scream at me and make me cry all night, causing me to go to ALL OF middle school with puffy eyes. She also had gotten physical with me, kicking me once and screaming at me to get out the house and how she doesn’t love me. She had kicked me out about 4 times, just to call me crying saying she didn’t mean it, which made me feel terrible for moving. The thing is, even through all of that, even through my mom somehow forgetting how to parent after she had already had two kids, I knew deep down somewhere in there that she loved me. I loved her at that point too. The verbal and occasionally physical abuse continued, we fought every single day. The cycle kept repeating. Fight, scream, slap, threaten, then an apology in asking me if I want to go shopping (which I figured out as I got older would just be to use against me). Because even though she did all of that, she loved me and was patient with me sometimes.  I started to hate her. I’d hear her wake up and get anxious, making me walk upstairs. I hated when she’d call me, felt deeply DEEPLY uncomfortable when she’d touch me or enter  my room, and not even because I was scared but because my body just reacted that way. Even her kind moments started to not matter. Her hugs, kisses, kind messages meant nothing to me because of all the bad. I had opened up to my stepdad about it, telling him how I am scared of losing the motive to better my relationship with my mom and how I was scared that I’d stop caring, and he told me it’s just a teenager thing. I am 18, still feeling this way. When I speak to her, I feel like I am acting. My littlest sister (on my dads side) is at the age where I first started acting up , and though she has her annoying moments I find her so easy to love. I don’t understand why or how my mom was so evil to me and feel so shitty because nobody understands me and says to stop holding a grudge. It isn’t a grudge, I can’t get out of this and I think im at a point where I am truly done. 

How do I heal? How do I not hate her guts and wish she wasn’t around ?

"Ten years ago when my little girls were 10 and 12, there was an incident at my parents house. My mother is an alcoholic and in a tantrum she had convinced my girls that I had hit her. I was healing up a broken leg and the girls were visiting me at their house from out of state. Immediately after this happened my parents put them both on a plane and sent them home to their mother (my ex wife)..and news that I had assaulted my mother spread throughout everyone in my life instantly. I could not defend myself because there were too many people involved who saw benefit in supporting this version of the story. It was like that by my mothers design to begin with. Now ten years later one of my daughters has reached out to me, but reconnection is on my mothers terms because she has held on to her influence over her. The moment I expressed any anger, my daughter immediately said I wasn't ready and blocked me again. We were so close and happy before this lie was told, and I have a really hard time accepting that everyone still thinks I assaulted my mother, and that I should be thankful to her for the chance to reconnect. I have missed them so much and missed out on so much in their lives. I don't expect my mother to apologize or set the matter straight, and her terms seem like they have been set for my failure ...further reinforcing her hold. I have no support on my end and I am struggling with how to handle the situation on my own. I can't take advice from anybody who doesn't believe me because it doesn't lead me to a solution. Thank you for reading my post."
"(copied and pasted from another sub bc i didnt get responses there)

It's been on my mind. I was previously emotionally abused by someone else in the past (PTSD after effects) but I can't bring this subject up to my therapist. I don't want something to happen. Like I said, I've been thinking about it for a while. For some context, I'm 17. Sorry if this is a weird post, I just need to ask someone. Ask questions, I'll answer.

When I was growing up, I think I was physically abused. Not to a terrible extent. Just some bad experiences. Like my mom used to put me under really cold water in the bathtub, kinda half drowning me. She'd also use to beat me. She once beat me so hard at the one sleepover I had as a kid I wasn't able to breathe. That and some other stuff. No permanent scarring, though. I remember scratching ""mommy hurts us"" into a bed frame. She'd also use to berate me in front of people, not sure why. I remember not getting an award from elementary school and she brought it up to my teachers and called me a failure or something. I know my dad told me he takes this tobacco things because he's stressed. Because of me? He also called me and my brother ""a little shit"" growing up. I remember my mom hit me with a knife and told me it was my fault for being bad. Anyways, I think... I think I was abused while growing up? I'm not sure.

During covid, so like my pre-teen years, it was kinda hellish. My parents and my brother would fight a lot and it would get physical. My brother is younger than me, so I guess it's weird they'd do that. They'd tell me and him to kill ourselves and whatever. I try not to remember. I wanted to run away and get emancipated and stuff like that. I remember telling and showing my friends an experience and their reaction was them being extremely off put. This was around the time of when I was getting abused by the previously mentioned person, so my memories are kinda bad. Sorry. I'll try to remember and add onto this.

I remember that when I was starting therapy and stuff my doctor asked if my parents were abusing me. She asked if I was scared of them and stuff like that. I answered no.

My mom is pretty much verbally abusive. I'm not sure about emotionally, she's never told me she was going to kill herself if I didn't do something. She did tell me growing up she wanted to kill herself because of me, though. I don't know if that counts. I've had some weird experiences with my parents, I guess. I know they can be weird sometimes. I'll pull up lists of abusive traits and see if that jogs my memory.

* ""Constant belittling, shaming, and humiliating."" Yeah. My mom does this. To her I'm just a failure. I remember a couple days ago when she saw me bring something to my room (which she assumed was to hurt myself with) she laughed and asked about the scars and was just laughing about it.
* ""Calling names and making negative comparisons to others."" She did this earlier today, I think. I'm ""aloo"", a potato, zero. She says I make her look bad in comparison to other people and their children.
* ""Telling a child they’re “no good,” “worthless,” “bad,” or “a mistake.”"" Begrudgingly, yeah. I'm a bad child, to my parents. Maybe I am? But that's something for another day.
* ""Limiting physical contact with a child—no hugs, kisses, or other signs of affection."" Probably just our asian culture, this doesn't happen. But it's also weird how my dad doesn't really say ""I love you"", my mom does sometimes. Maybe that's just asian culture though.
* ""Exposing a child to violence against others, whether it is against the other parent, a sibling, or even a pet."" Yeah, to my brother. He has it worse.
* ""never saying anything kind, expressing positive feelings or congratulating a child on successes"" Yeaaah... I won an award for something a little bit ago and my mom was mad that I only got one award.
* ""shaming"" a bit vague but I would say a little bit. My mom does this in front of my friends and kinda always has.
* ""Blaming"" also vague but helllll yeah. its all my fault, i guess ive internalized it enough to actually believe it though lol
* ""Ridiculing"" i dont think this comes from a place of love.

Also they're kicking me out as soon as I turn 18, if that means anything. Maybe that's just american culture?  
My parents can be nice sometimes, I guess. I used to cry to her a little. Maybe like four times in the last couple of years? They pay for my stuff and let me live with them. My room is full of stuff. I don't think I'm neglected.

I've told one of my friends about this. He thinks I'm being abused and says I'm excusing my parents behaviors and stuff.

When I see other parents, I feel so weird. My parents aren't like that. I think I described other parents as ""so nice"" in comparison to mine. Like, actually caring about your feelings? That's actually so crazy.

Anyways yeah, ask me questions and i'll answer. I don't know if i should add more or less? Thanks for reading"
"I don't wanna seem like I'm being dramatic, but she threatens to kill me if I call CPS or Childline, she blames all her problems on me, ridicules me and insults me, ignores my emotions, tricks me into feeling bad, hits me when I did nothing while she's mad, yells and screams at me, etc, etc. She also tells me ""I'll give you something to cry about"" and keeps making me cry, it happens nearly every day. She sometimes forgot to feed me when I was younger, argues with my uncle then takes her anger out on me, sometimes she still doesn't feed me, but I can cook now."
"For context, I’ve been going to this church for +10 years and I started singing in the worship team when I was 14.
For extra context, I live with a very emotionally and verbally abusive mother who knows how to manipulate the narrative and always makes herself the victim, even in situations that are not from her life (this will be important later).

In the Pandemic, my mother exploded.
My stepfather and I would have 2 weeks of peace AT MOST and then she would get very aggressive and impulsive for around two weeks as well, and then she would get very depressed, threatening to take her life if we ever left her. 
My church leaders knew about this because at that time, I couldn’t afford a therapist and I just needed someone to talk to. I thought I could trust them.

Fast forward to last year (2023), and it all came crashing down for me. I started feeling like I didn’t belong in the worship team anymore and I felt alone because they spoke awfully about mental health issues.
On my side, I got tatted and I will admit that I knew it was against our doctrine but I honestly felt so at peace with myself and with my spirit, and I don’t believe I’ve sinned against God.
But then, I went to church and they told me every comment and insult that you guys can imagine.
That I was too emotional and impulsive.
That I should keep quiet whenever I didn’t like something about the church because I was speaking badly about the bride of Christ.
That I wasn’t the example they wanted kids to follow.
They weren’t sure I was fit to be a mother even though I was “biologically ready” (I’m 24. To bring a child in this economy and world!? Sir, please).
And they KNOW I’m sensible to words because of YEARS of verbal and emotional abuse from my mother.

I later got to know that they had meetings about me without me (including my mother) in which they talked about me, debated on whether to let me stay on the worship team or not, what they were going to do with me, etc.

My mother had some influence in there and even though they HAVE SEEN physical proof, and heard recordings and videos of how she treats me, they chose to believe whatever it is that she told them (to this day, I don’t know what it was).


I started going to the psychiatrist a few months ago and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
My psychiatrist also recommended that I change churches and, if things became too bad with my mother, proceed legally.
I feel so lost and scared and I don’t know what to do. I left the worship team even though I loved singing and praising Jesus.
And I also love my mother. I know that she can be a good person, but it is so hard to love her that it hurts.
It’s like hugging a rose with thorns and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells every day.

Am I in the wrong?"
"I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (we are both in our early 20s) for almost 2 years now. She has been wonderfull to me the whole time, and I don't think I know anyone more underestanding and open in my life, she is incredibly smart and amazing at getting how and why people feel or act in certain ways.

She comes from an average home, some stuff hasn't been great, but generally her parents are good people, and have give her a sense of safety, she counts on them and talks to them all the time, and she trusts them to tell them issues she deals with.

I on the other hand, come from a bit of a complicated situation. My parents have been, for as long as I can remember, psycologically, verbally (heavy on this one) and sometimes even phisically (not very common) abusive to me. Our relationship has gotten a lot better the past year, and I can't say I hate them for what they did to me. I've been going to therapy for around 2 years as well, and only recently started really digging into the abuse, and realizing how wrong it really was.

I came to the realization a few weeks ago that I want to tell my girlfriend, if not all of it at least enough that she can truly underestand what's so wrong with me. Im fucked in the head and I've known that for a long time, but I feel like if I don't explain myself a little, she will never truly underestand the reason why raised voces scare me, why I cry when a stupid movie shows a good parents, why I panic when something gets dropped/broken/spilled. 
There is also the matter that I recently realized I don't know how to tell when someone is being violent if they aren't yelling and hitting. My therapist says that's because I register anything below that as safe due to how I grew up. But I find that very scary, I'm afraid I might have been violent without realizing, or that I will be at some point. She usually is very quick to tell me when something bothers her, and she has been an angel with that, because I'm not the quickest to underestand social things, but she always takes the time to make sure I got it, and I always try my best to better myself for her, she deserves only the best. But it's a scary thought nonetheless. 

I've been thinking that I should tell her about all this, or at least a part of it, so that we can keep building a healthy relationship, and also because sometimes I feel like I'm miles away because I can't explain what's going on in my head. Im unsure as to how or when, and an irracional part of me is scared to death that she will think I'm exagerating, or won't believe me. My therapist said it would be best to discuss it after Im done healing, but I honestly don't feel confortable just ignoring the elephant in the room completly. Ive made some coments here and there before, so she already knows I wasn't raised quite right. 

I just wanted to vent a bit and hear you all if anyone has some advice or ideas




(It's my first time posting in this subreddit so if Im breaking any rules please let me know) "
"I guess it's kinda logical after me refusing contact  for nearly 2 years. But I'm still mad.

She still had a way to give them to me through my dad but decided to rather make a quick buck of it. Some of the things are expensive video games and books I cherish very much. I couldn't take everything with me and knew I would never see them again. But actually knowing there's no way of getting them back is crushing me.

Update: I did something stupid and messaged her on a burner account telling her that instead of selling my belongings she should give them my dad. I also told her no matter if she accepts it, she abused me and that no contact is the best for both of us.

I know this was extremely stupid. Emotions were too high. There's no way to delete the message. I don't know what I should do. I guess I have to fess up to my dad since they will probably contact him. But I'm too afraid having to confront my emotions and my weakness."
"I am grown up man not good with social setting 
I think my family try to embarrssingn me on puropse,
i was just sit with my dad he immediately says about me negative comments , he exactly said you look more hondsome and then told me my hair is very long and there is dark spot in my feet
I got the same behavior with young brother same attitude for example i say something funny , he says 'he is smart!' Sometimes both try to  humilate me in family gathering 
Like my brother shouted loud out of nowhere that i spent 3 years jobless and looking for a job in family gathering
I just dont react what is the best thing to answer for this kind of behavior

"I am currently 27(F) and I just moved out of my abusive household. My family was both physically and emotionally abusive, more so emotionally as I got older. The constant put-downs never really stopped even just a month ago. My mom does love me but she says awful things like telling me to die when she’s upset, and this has been said to me my entire life. I don’t speak to my dad or my brother because they are the same exact people. Walking around my home felt like eggshells, because I was constantly being judged and criticized for being a normal adult woman. My father hated the fact that he could not control me and did not show me respect. He has called me a wh0re for wearing a normal black dress. My brother learned to treat me badly because of my dad. The depression and anxiety got so bad that I was thinking heavily about suicide. 

Now that I am finally free, I don’t think I’ve fully processed it yet until now and it’s been 3 days to be exact. I guess I feel safe. More free to be myself, without any criticism.

"Many of my (27M) abusive experiences took place while eating in family at the kitchen table. One of the phrases I remember the most from my father is ""seeing you eating grosses me out"". Until my teen years, I was frequently scolded, screamed at and even physically hit during meals, for being a ""picky eater"". I was literally afraid of eating with my family.

This caused me several problems with food. This is not the first time I'm opening a thread about this. But one problem in particular that I've only noticed frequently, is that I seem to get some sort of anxiety or panic attack when somebody gives me a more or less ""dedicated"" meal, and I don't eat it for not liking it. It has happened to me at least three times in the last one or two years: once with friends, once at my job, and once at a restaurant.

I grew up receiving nothing but violence for just saying I didn't like the food I was given. And up to this day. it looks like I still react with fear when I reject food.

I wonder, is this just me? Does somebody else suffers or suffered from something similar?"
"I finally see it - that family that's doing things the RIGHT way. There's no guilt, no parentification, no anger, no harm, but there's love, compassion and understanding. The kids get in trouble, but the parents take the time to EXPLAIN why they're in trouble and what they should have done differently. 

  
I know I don't see what's going on behind closed doors after I leave their home, but it's shocking to see how HAPPY they are. I've told them they're good parents, but I don't think they believe me. How do I explain it better without burdening them with my own trauma? They're insightful, I'm pretty sure they've guessed already."
"So my parents lied about me and they let some weird stranger in and I got raped. Then I was mishandled by the hospital a few times and got stuck with a dirty needle. 

Edit: It might be cousin or an old friend. They are too gullible. I just dont know but it wpuld make sense of how they got in then other ppl got in.
I know they issues.  I haven't seen them in a while."
"I can handle having conflicts with outside people; I can handle being in verbal, heated arguments with someone but when it comes to my mom insulting me, using my weaknesses or flaws against me, my god, it's such a sour pill to swallow to know that I can't even confide anything of my personal life to my mom in fear of her using it against me. I've always thought family is meant to help each other become stronger, to help each other overcome obstacles, not to tear each other apart over every mistake. Maybe I'm still too naive, if I can't even put my trust in my own family member, who else can I trust? I'm sorry for venting. If someone is dealing with abusive parent(s), I hope you still hang in there, keep going & become stronger. It sucks so bad, I know"
"They are like the smartest people I know yet do and say the most ignorant and oblivious things. My Dad put hands on me unjustly period. He doesn't usually do that but he still did it, multiple times, and my mom at times too. So I go to the counselor, not to call CPS, literally just vent. She listens to me and then files a report without my knowledge. You don't even have a say in it like that yet my mom LOVES blaming this on me.

That is literally the reason they came and my dad wants to be like ""well you should've come initiated conversation about religion and LGBTQ shit"" cuz I left and i'm bi with me WHILE JUST IGNORING THE FACT THAT HE PUT HE TOSSED A COMPUTER AT ME AND HIT ON ME MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHT MULTIPLE MONTHS ON N OFF now the cops sent some mail n stuff and my mom months earlier got a call bout the CPS people ""escalating"" this. I don't even think my dad is abusive ig? But he has done some abusive stuff, and i've said that multiple times. The thing is, they don't listen to me so it kept happening, on and off but it happened. Not even that too, it was just mentally taxing even talking to them bout this religious stuff Then they just blame it all on me.

Edit: Watching this vid on gaslighting and they're literally doing that. Making me feel small and literally trying to change reality. Like they keep blaming MY actions for why they keep when in reality the counselor listened to what I was telling her, which was me just explaining what happened,. Not some cry for help and yet they insist that it was my fault. Were also black so he brings that into it and the system which is valid but then tells me how I'm trying to work with the system implying he knows more about it even though they keep blaming me for this. LIKE I DON'T WANT TO TALK BOUT HOW U THINK BEIN TRANS IS WEIRD AND HOW ME NOT BEING APART OF ANY RELIGION IS WEIRD. I told them my opinion, they have told me there's. Now I really don't want it now and they WON'T respect that. I'm 17 and I still live with them and that's even more tricky cuz now they feel like they own me, or get the right to treat me however or say whatever. 

I don't know what to do, even my peoples don't know, some of em even abandoned me not even listening to me."
"I’ve just graduated high school so I feel like I can say more now than I could before, but is my dad abusive?

I believe myself that he is verbally abusive, manipulative, a narcissist, and mentally and emotionally abusive. 
I think it kind of started after he came back from the military, I mean he’s always been strict but never to this extent. He has said a lot of things so called “out of anger” like how he wanted to strangle me, how if he has the option to not deal with my sister he wouldn’t have had he at all, how if we wanted to kill ourselves we should just do it and get it over with so he can clean up the mess.

And he says he doesn’t mean it in that way? What otter way can we take that coming from our dad? 
My father has only ever worked his whole life so he tries to get us to help around the house, which I had no issue with until he started just nagging. It was something I wasn’t doing right every time, I didn’t clean the kitchen the right way, I don’t cook enough, I don’t consider peoples feelings, and not even with chores in the house! I’m a kind of curvy girl and all he can ever tell me is how far I’m going to get if I don’t work out (I do) or how ugly my back looks in some dresses! He even said I looked funny in my prom dress????
This morning he came to blame me about protein powder assuming I used it all and started hurling remarks at me when he was the one who used it last? I really can’t take it anymore, especially after my sister got in trouble for liking a boy and my dad told her he would only want to get in her pants and LIFTED HER SHIRT TO POINT AT HER BOOBS?? He yelled at her that boys would only want that from her, she was wearing no bra.

I don’t care if he is my dad but that should have never happened, we are girls and he is a man! That much self respect should be in his head but it isn’t! I haven’t even mentioned him throwing a knife and glass shard at my sister and me telling us to kill ourselves infront of him (we wanted to at one point) and slamming me against my dresser one time just because I was journaling my thoughts.
He does this thing where he forgets stuff on purpose to make us feel dumb or stupid about what we reminded him about too, and it’s used on our mother too. If it’s not his way then it’s no one’s way.

A lot of our “acting out” was triggered by him. He was the reason I tried to run away, cut myself a little the start of high school, and developed really bad depression. Though I can never just talk it through with him.
So is he abusive?"
"I've lived with my dad for my dad for as long as I been on this earth. As much as I'd love to get away from him and move into my own place for my own sanity, I can't. So the next best thing I do is avoid him and try to do my own shit.  
I really feel he has had a huge negative effect on my psyche on how I've become as a human being. He is the typical machismo alpha tough guy who feels like he is the leader in everything. He is always right, and is not willing to discuss or debate ANYTHING. He is often always angry. If not at me, but at other things. But since I am forced to live with him I often come under his abuse. When he confronts me I don't argue. I avoid making eye contact, and just say yes and sorry to everything he says. But nothing I do other than being gone is enough to satisfy him. He even said once I am only around because of my mom who he seems to reserve his only compassion for. He will even get unnerved and jealous if I show my mom care and mimic me like an overgrown schoolyard bully, and call me a weak mamma's boy. My brother was heavily abused by him too, and he grew up to be even worse than him. My dad will often drink wine and get very scary at night. Times when I've had to flee the house and drive away because he will invade my room and try to assault me, only for him to have no memory of it the next day. Refuses to apologize. He will drag my mom in and twist the situation of my presence being a cause for her stress, and imply I am slowly killing her.  
He often guilts and intimidates me saying I have no rights as long as I live under his roof. I want to get away but I have nobody to turn to. I am far too old to be treated like this. The only escape I have is to isolate myself in my room, temporarily drive off, or be at my job."

My stepmom every single chance she could get would tell me my bio mother hated me and chose drugs over me and that my biological brothers were horrible disgusting people and I should hate them and that my dad wasn't my real dad.



My stepmom when we would go outside would touch my private area sometimes.


She slapped me over remote control once because I wouldn't turn the TV off and I wouldn't give her my tablet( that my grandmother got me) to give to my brother cuz he broke his.


Would try to get my dad to spank me all the time constantly.


Would pretend I'd hit her so my dad would take her side and punish me.

Like two months ago, I searched for advice in my father because I was really afraid of my brother’s mental health (he had told me he was not ok) and as I dont have any source of income, I felt safe to talk to my father and tell him like, hey! we need a little money so we can pay for my brother’s therapy because he’s not okay right now. I thought he, you know, a mature adult, and instead of talking me down or something, he just started yelling at me some crazy shit, he told me we should off ourselves, he told me its all my fault, he told me im a devil and that’s why i’m “fat” and a lot of terrible things. He was yelling all of really near to my face and i decided to stand up and try to punch him far, I was desesperate, he is way taller and obviously stronger than me, and he sat me down in the matter of a second and started choking me with his hand around my neck, I couldn’t fucking breathe. My mother stepped between us and separated us. Who knows what could have happened if she wasn’t there. I dont talk to him, but my mother wants me to “let it slide”, she has tried to convince me he just made a mistake. Im extremely sad. I cant believe even my mother doesn’t care about my well being and it’s not mad that man did that to me. I cant leave my household because i cant afford renting or living on my own because im finishing my pre med degree and my mom pays for it. I love my mom, i just want to know what to do, i dont wanna give up my dreams just for my abusive dad but it breaks my heart in million little pieces when my moms tells me to just forget it. 

I really don’t want to give up on medicine. "
"He shouts at me a lot over small issues, and emotionally abuses me. Today when I was picking stuff off the floor, he hit me hard in the back. He continued to scream at me for minutes before storming off. My mum did nothing, and didn't check in on me. In fact she picked up a conversation with my dad and started laughing."

"My mom is not doing so well.  And I’m an adopted only child. For years it’s “oh well you can take care of me when I am older”.  I’m 39.  Solo and alone myself.  She is too. However. My entire child hood was her sick. Always some issue.  Real or not- every memory of something joyful in my life was ruined by her “being sick” which never came to real life.  When I was 5? She did have thyroid cancer. And I was left with other people. She left me to take care of her brother (which I commend) when I was 12-14.  She left me 2-5 to take care of her mom.  Any time something fun was planned - she’d make an excuse “no I have a headache” or she would check my room to make sure it was perfectly clean.  If there was one thing out of place- for example my first time planned to go to Disney- she was checking for anything out of place, and stubbed her toe. Cancelled the entire trip.  I was 10.  She cancelled things over and over again. Forced me
To quit track, soccer, anything I loved in high school but forced me to do music lessons.  Now years later at 39 denies she did that.  Every thing I do is wrong or awful in her mind. I’ve been dumped because of her and her controlling.  I get screamed at every week at 39 for things and I’m f*ing done. 

TLDR: I’m not taking care of my mom.  And I feel awful I have no feelings anymore.  My whole childhood was her being sick.  Real or fake.  I didn’t get a childhood. Now I’m planning to travel and live my life.  And she’s not going to stop it.  I feel sick I’m like this- but I’m done.  I’m just done being forced to live my life by her rules. "
"I’m really thinking about having an awkward but necessary talk with my whole family. I am 17(M) and my family drives me insane lets start with my mom, she has always held me back and been manipulative she never lets me go anywhere, and I am now 17, so there's no excuse now. I no longer like her, and she's always wondering why im rude to her and no longer like her (keep in mind I am not rude at all just very quiet) my grandma is even crazier she yells at me over little things like forgetting to throw away or clean something or scenarios where half of the things she could've done her self like seriously she calls me from the other room, and she does this thing where she makes me come instead of her coming to me and half of the time it will be something like turning off a light that she could've turned off herself It's not just that she's also very rude and physically abusive she hit me once for not closing the cap of a tube of toothpaste paste (that's never been a job for me ever and also its toothpaste) I have no dad however my grandpa is chill however he gave up on defending me from my grandma because she's so crazy, and they begin to argue whenever he defends me, and it gets scary even now they have never let me go anywhere with friends or do anything they constantly monitor me and watch me they don't trust me at home even though ill be doing the same thing while they're gone (nothing at all) someone always has to be at the house babysitting me while I bed rot all day against my will while they complain about how I stay in my bed all day and how lazy I am. I am an extrovert, so being inside all day is killing me. I don't know what to do. I can't do it anymore. I want to have a talk or intervene with them, but they are crazy and gaslight me as if I'm the problem. They treat me like I'm stupid and patronize me constantly. I am so patient and kind to them, despite their stupidity and rudeness. How should I go about talking to them? What should I do?"
"i dont know whether its delusion ,entitlment,foolishness or all"
"My life story (TW) 

This is my story. I’ve recently (on another account) been going around Reddit, and trying to help people (especially children) get out of abusive situations, and to help people learn how to cope with their past abuse. I’ve been getting questions on how do i know so much, and is it due to me having to deal with things in the past, and the answer is yes. I want to grow my charity (i guess that is what you would call) when I’m older so i can help more people. So here is my story.


My life started when my druggie of a mother and my alcoholic of father got together. And they had me. I was born deprived of the nutrients i needed, and for some reason the doctors thought this was okay and didn’t report my parents. I was dumped at relatives house and moved around for 3 years till i was shoved back into my parents house. And things just then got worse.


My parents attempted to put me in a sex trafficking ring for money, but the deal somehow didn’t work out and I was never officially put in. However, they later made me become an altar girl, and you know how that turns out. The priest molested me (about six months) until other parents took him to court, where he found not guilty on all charges.


My mother and father never got better. They laid off on the drugs slightly but they were still extremely abusive. At the age of three i was tied to my bed for 2 days and was beaten with belts and sticks, just because i scuffed my really old shoes. My mother has strangled me on numerous occasions. My father has molested and i strongly believe he has raped me (the memory is really fuzzy.) I was forced to work at the age of 10 so i could eat food. I was told the world would be better off if i died and that no one would care if i was gone. I was told I’m a cruel person, and that I’m ugly and stupid. I was beaten so much, altogether i have broken 36 bones. I have been put on drug runs for them, starting at the age of 4. They have attempted to drown me, poison me and more. They have sold my things on ebay and facebook so they can pay for expensive clothes and furniture.


At the age of 13, i moved out to my great aunts house. She was very very very poor and i went without eating some nights, but it was better than living with my parents. She was also very sick mentally and she would kick me out and bring me back in. I moved out again to my parents as i Was forced to, and she later died. When i was living with her my parents tortured and killed my cat.


At 14, i moved into my grandparents for about a month, until i was forced to go back with my parents. My grandparents never believed what i was saying, and blamed me for everything, saying i was insane, and ungrateful for what my parents did do right. At this point i had had enough and i went and reported my parents and family to the police and child services, for the abuse i had endured. 


I am now in a very long, brutal court case with against my family. Everyday, i am trolled and harassed  for speaking my story, by family, ex-friends and complete strangers on the internet. I am not sharing my story for sympathy points, as i have been accused of. I just want people to know that they are not alone. I’m still trying to heal from my past. I know what i was missing and want to give that to people that who need it. thank you to whoever is reading.

" Hello everyone,

I'm new here and I hope this post is appropriate. I'm an alienated mother, separated from my son since 2020. Currently, I'm enrolled in a doctoral program in forensic psychology, and I am conducting a study on parental alienation.

If you're a parent who has experienced alienation from your child or children, I would greatly appreciate your help by filling out this questionnaire. This study is very important to me, and your participation would mean a lot.

Thank you!

"At this point my dad's all but pulled out his dick and raped me. He's touched parts of me I haven't even touched, made me do things and say things so fucking violating and horrible it just feels like I have zero dignity around him now. He's stripped me of every shred of pride I have and now just because he's been forced into therapy and he's supposedly ""trying to change"" from the years of fucking abuse and violence and trauma I'm just supposed to be able to forgive him, and act normal around him, and pretend like he hasn't violated me physically and mentally. Like his presence doesnt forever remind me of the fact that his hands have been between my legs, and that whenever I tried to stop him I never could because I was too fucking afraid. And every time I remember how I let him do it and I let him touch me and hit me and violate me because I was too much of a fucking coward to tell him to stop, I just feel so ashamed. The fact that his threats are enough to make me just obey him like some mindless bitch and he just has so much control over me makes me want to throw up. And I don't know how to face him anymore knowing what hes seen and done, said to me and made me say and made me do. His presence feels like a reminder of how much control he has over me just because he threatens shit. 

The one time I tried to get him to stop all he needed to do was threaten to beat me up and I just shriveled and gave up. It's so ridiculously easy for him to do all this shit to me I'm a fucking joke. 

I'm not going to the police, or CPS. And I'm not gonna explain why not because it's really hard to explain. I just need to figure out how to forget all of this. "
"A while ago, I was sitting in the car with my parent and this has happened before. Out of no where he begins to talk about how we both are good at manipulating people and have the charm nesasarry to get what we want. Or another time when I overheard him talking about me and my siblings he said, ""they sullied my name"". He's said a bunch of other stuff I won't get into, but is this weird to you?"
My mom is very emotional abusive and she forced me and her to move in with her bf of 4 months it’s been a couple of months since we moved in before I warned her bc his ex gf was about 30 years younger than him and claimed that she was abused and beaten by him. My mom says that his ex is lying and that he told her she was crazy. Anyways with a bunch of other red flags. Tonight my mom and him were drunk well he told me how this morning I was running late for work and I slammed the door and how if he wasn’t on call he would of came and tacked me down and choked me till I knocked out. This isn’t the first time he has threatened to beat me one time my mom moved my coffe mug next to the sink even though I wasn’t done and he thought I put it next to the sink and he started cussing me out and told me how he was going to beat me and my mom just goes oh that was me who did that. I am scared to be under this roof I turn 18 soon I plan on moving out.
"Hi! I am a teen who is in a extremely tricky situation. I am currently trying to get away from my abusive parent, and also try to get into a mental treatment place because I am struggling with my depression that is getting extremely bad. I plan for my other parent to take me, I know that CPS usually ask you questions about that and I wanna be honest with them, but i am extremely afraid of where They would take me & where I would end up. If anyone has any idea of what might happen to me please feel free to tell me! 

Thank you so much xx "

"Hey, I just created this Reddit account just so I could ask this question.

I am a teen, about to enter adulthood, just graduated from high school.

Basically, my father always gets mad at me whenever I do something wrong, which while seeks normal, his triggers and reasoning is what is odd.

For some perspective, one time my father lashed out at me in a public restaurant because when I was trying to get my straw out of the paper I accidentally bent it.

I didn't have a reaction to bending the straw, it wasn't his straw, I wasn't a worker there fumbling my job or something, we were just eating dinner at a restaurant, and I did nothing that day to trigger him, everything was going well up to this point, he just got mad at me for accidentally bending my own straw.

This was no an occurrence that happened when I was really little or something, this happened earlier this year, so you can imagine how easily my dad gets triggered by my mistakes.

He would also yell at me for being nervous, which always seemed counterproductive to me, but maybe I'm wrong.

He would insult me, get mad at me for not wanting to spend time with him, and when I would try, he would continue the cycle.

And to be clear, I don't hate jokes towards me, I think it's perfectly good to have a friendly laugh at each other, but this wasn't that, he'd be putting me down and then get upset when I didn't want to be around him.

He'd hate it when I cry, which I guess I could understand, no one likes crying all the time, but what stuck out to me is that he told me, he would stop getting mad at me and start trying to solve problems calmly with me once I stopped crying.

So with time, I learned how to hold in my tears, but my dad didn't keep his word, he still got angry with me all the same, I kept trying until around my last two years of high school, now I just wait until I'm all alone to cry.

He also once threatened that if I ever got him sent to prison, once he got out, he would show me what it was like to get beat up, this was because he once got into trouble with the police because I was scared he was going to beat me up.

I did not intend for my dad to get in trouble with the police, but I was really scared, my dad never punched me, but he did spank me, once with a belt, I remember crying and begging him not to do it, and he would yell at me to turn around.

I was usually in trouble because of school, I am special needs and struggle with behavioral problems, but something I did notice was my behavioral problems were either better or worse depending on what teacher I had, my behavioral problems were at their worst when the teacher was a jerk, meanwhile when I got lucky and got teachers who were nice people, I did quite well in school.

It didn't help that my dad didn't even realize I was special needs until the third grade, but his temper didn't change, the only thing that did change was how loudly he yelled at me, because we also found out I had sensitive ears, so his yelling was literal torture for me, this doesn't mean he stopped yelling, just now, he wasn't putting his all into it.

But anyways, back to the whole threatening my life thing, you probably thought this happened after he spoke with the police, you probably thought that was just something he said in the heat of the moment. Nope.

My dad getting in trouble with the police happened when I was in 2nd grade, my dad threatening my life happened when I was in 9th or 10th grade, and I had never threatened to call police on him once, I never even once threatened to tell anyone how he treats me, he just decided it was a good time to remind me of how easily he could kill me, and he didn't play it for a joke, he played it straight.

My dad also try to weaponize my interests, anything I was enjoying, he would use it as a means to insult me or punish me, I once told him I felt this way, and he told me to my face that he is going to weaponize my interests.

Which surprise surprise, led me to being much more secretive about what I'm into, which led him to being upset that I started being so reclusive.

He also wanted me to feel bad for caring about my friends, during the pandemic, I spoke to people from my school online, and during a conversation with someone, they opened up to me about how they aren't doing well mentally and was thinking of killing himself.

I of course, was worried about him, but when my dad asked what I was doing, and I foolishly told my dad I was worried about my friend, he made fun of me and my suicidal friends.

This mockery of me caring for others even continued at dinner, when he thought it was hilarious I was worried someone wanted to end their own life.

I wish I didn't let that affect me getting friends once the pandemic ended, because now I have hardly anyone to turn to for help, which is why I had to turn here.

My dad has also refused to teach me how to do certain things, like laundry, one summer I asked him to please teach me, and he didn't.

He also would be too tired to cook dinner, buy take out, and then complain about how I always want to eat out and how it's costing him so much money.

There are plenty more times when my dad thought it was appropriate to lash out at me, but those are just the times I immediately thought of.

Now I'm in a position where I'm so scared to be thrown out of my house, because he'll be legally allowed to, and I'll have no where to go, I will starve.

My dad ever since I was little had always told me he spoils me, so I always have this thought, maybe he's right. I'm just overreacting, I know I told all these like I'm the victim, but maybe I'm just a brat.

My sad does plenty of nice things, he's given gifts to me, but I don't want him to buy whatever I want, I just want to be able to spend time with him and not have to worry about getting yelled at.

I love my dad, I want him to be proud of me, but I often feel like I'm not the kid he wants, he wants someone else, someone from his generation, he always complains about my generation.

I'm not the kid he wants, I just hope he loves me at least a little. "
"Argued with my mom over something so ultimately inconsequential. She didn’t even apologize after she realized her mistake. Ofc she didn’t cause she never fucking does. I said she doesn’t even care and that’s the worse part. She said “of course I care”. I said no she didn’t because if she did, she would’ve gotten an abortion knowing she wouldn’t be able to care for 3 teens and a set of twins.

I couldn’t stop crying in the shower. When I came back to the room I had to ask her why she couldn’t have just stopped at 3 kids. WHY. WHY. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BRING ME TO THIS FUCKING EARTH. WHY MOM. WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME. "
"So this going to be long, i'll try to summerize as much as possible. SO!
While growing up i was 3rd child, and usually i've played alone cz everyone was busy. As i was growing more, my parents expected me to have all perfect grades since ,,i dont do nothing trough the house"" mind you i was a damn kid, and the only time they ,teach me' is trough yelling. 
By the time i tried to uphold perfect grades i've been bullied (like actually) ngl it would be rarepy physical but i was humiliated so much trough life i feel numb at this point.

I never opened up to them, bcz we barely spend time together, and whenever i had different opinion i'd be laughed, mocked upon. So i didnt bother anymore. I was scared to tell them about bullying cz they yelled and always minimize my feelings. 
I never gotten outside - YES - to hang out properly, i never asked for something big, or money, or anything really.....and i was called spoiled. 

So at high-school after so many ongoing belitlment  to the point i've received comemnts like ,,you'll be no one and nothing, i regret giving bearth to you..."" one they it clicked and i started standing up for myself. 

And ever since then it gotten worse.....
At first i was being respectful and then turned onto me cussing specially at dad. He is very manipulative, twists narrative and everyone follows him despite not liking his attitude cz he is a ,provider' of family. 
The only time in my life, he was to ridicule. 

Anyways, is started as emotional thing trough physical abuse. Desk on the floor, throwing things, punching me and kicking, holding my neck - and telling me how i should be grateful for not being killed just bcz he can..... 
It gotten to point where i ran away multiple tomes, got 2 of phone broken cz i wanted to call the police and had evidance. 

What hurts me tho, my mom who was also abused by him in the past, he was sticking by his side and pointing fingers at me that i was the one peovoking him so i deserve it. 

Never once ever anyone tough of maaaybe calling the police?? 

Im now 23 and deeply regret listening to my teacher who told me i quote ,,he does that bcz he loves you"". I've been gaslight by peiple so much and all i have is resentment and hatred towards him. 

We are now in more advanced country, and i've tried being extra responsible ,,cz i was not before"" and guys.......

After all cooking something special (so they have breakfast, dinner AND take it at work - take time to make stuff like this), cleaning, picking up my little sister from school walking cz we cant afford car, sacrifise my free time, space to make new friends, i have bo friends except online, no money, no real life support. All cz i was honest, standing up for my rights and im just sad and miserable. 


I do have confidence but it hurts that i'll the only time i'll be acknowledged is when i get successful on my own. And guess what i live in such culture that HE will take all the credit for it. Im sick of this!

There so many things that has happened but this is the fastest i can tell. 
Thanks for everyone that read my desperate venting but yes im devistated that i look like i have a family but i really do not.....


P. S.S.
- Extra points = My family told me to keep quiet about this while dad has been telling everyone that i was being rebellious and was provoking him (which makes it even harder to my my part of story beliable since the evidances are gone) .....all i wanted is an apology, and him stop blaming other for his mistakes

So pleaseee! If ANYONE starts to think ,,He/she said/will change"" i'm here tot ell you they will NEVER! 
Unfortunately YES your family indeed can be selfish. 

Do not let your understanding become enabling. Peace."
"I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My mother is a malignant narcissist and I finally cut them all off DEC2023. My husband and his family was the only thing good that happened to me. I tried and fought hard to protect it, I didnt want my Mom to ruin this for me too. But she did! It seems like she already manipulated my MIL and now she's become a flying monkey. Im devastated cause I can never go back from this! I feel betrayed. "
I am 17 I will be 18 in a month and I won’t be able to afford to move out. My mom has always taken her anger out on me. After my dad left I became the person she cusses out and screams to. When I was 14 she was mad at me for not having a job and she would neglect me which kind let me get into a relationship that was really abusive for a while. Anyway fast forward 3 years she hit with this guy and made me and her move and buy a house and have him live with us. I don’t think life is going as good as she planned I tried to warn her but she took it as me trying to ruin her only chance of happiness. I work at a chain store kinda like Walmart basically and I’ve worked there since I was 15 I had to transfer and now I don’t get many hours and it pisses my mom off but she won’t let me quit and she won’t let me get a second job. The other day she saw my car was a little dirty and she cussed me out and told me the if she was her dad she would of taken her belt and wiped me til I bleed she’s done this to me before where she threatens to beat me since I was a kid just wondering is it normal for this to be the case I’m 17 so I can’t get a full time job and my mom hates her new job and  takes all her anger out on me.
"About 3 years ago my seperated mom and dad got into a huge fight over a ridiculous thing. This whole thing resulted in her calling the CPS, lying and exaggerating about my dad and his mom neglecting my little brother that is 10 years younger than me. Her lies started an investigation by the CPS that lasted a couple of months but resulted in nothing. Due to this and a lot of different factors but the final straw being a two page A4 message about how shitty of a son and brother i was to my younger brother, after I the day before told her ""maybe"" when she asked if she could eventually borrow one of my monitors in the future, I went no contact with her and has been in no contact ever since. She also went on about how she regrets every good thing she ever did for me and bla bla bla. The fucking entitlement, holy shit! A couple of months before this she also committed a fake suicide after I and my dad distanced ourselves from her. She swallowed some ibuprofen (not nearly enough to kill) and called the ambulance. She later admitted that it was a “call for help” and that it was not a real suicide attempt.

Even before the first call to the CPS my mother once told me how my brother once told her that he wanted to live at her house (which is a totally normal thing for a 8 year old to do. Especially when you straight up ask him if he would want to live at your house and of course  it doesn’t actually mean that he wants to move there full time). Fast forward to late 2023, the CPS got anonymous complaints which resulted in an investigation once again. But this time they actually had a reason to be worried since my brother's mother, who he stayed at every other week was not doing well physically which resulted in my brother staying home from school a lot due to depression brought on by the worry about his mothers health. After a couple of months of investigating they decided to transfer my brother to my mother. And i dont for the life of me understand why the CPS didn't just give my dad full custody over my brother since 99% of their worries were about my brother's mom. They have yet to give him a logical reason for their decision, which probably means that my mom has been talking shit about him to the CPS.

 During the my mother decided to help dad and my brother's mom in the case. She was playing extremely helpful the whole time, her goal of course being to take full custody over my brother the whole time, which even looked like the best option in the end since the alternative would have been a whole different family. So my only alternative right now if I want to retain my relationship with my little brother at the same level is to resume contact with my plotting, manipulative, probably psychopath mother. She won. My dad and my brother´s mom doesn't seem to understand that they were being played and manipulated from the beginning and I don't know if i should tell them or not and a part of me want to believe that he just happened to be placed there by chance and that she wasn't plotting at all to begin with. What would you do in this situation?

"
for me its something bigger and much more complicated than that lol
"I need to get out. I'm scared and desperate for any help any donation will help me escape this hellhole and move in with my grandparents across country. Any support gets me away from her social services refuse to help me, Please if you can donate please do i’m begging, I can’t go to bed comfortably because i’m scared she may beat me while i sleep again."

more ragdolls to beat?
"And she immediately gave me that angry, hateful, ugly look that makes me see red every time. 

My brother and I basically had zero friends growing up due to severely stunted social skills thanks to mother. I love her; I really do and I had good memories with her, but... Where are the memories with friends and classmates? There are none because she was a HUGE CONTROL FREAK. She was always paranoid that the worst would happen to us, so she didn't let us go anywhere to even make friends. We only played with the super sweet Filipino boy neighbors because... They were neighbors! Whenever my brother and I would mess up in the slightest or if it wasn't our fault, she would hit us and say ""you can't do ANYTHING RIGHT"". Being isolated from mostly anyone else that wasn't family made us internalize all the ways she was being toxic to us. She doesn't wanna admit it, but I just KNOW the angry outbursts against us was her frustration from working two jobs to support us because she was too stupid to find a man that wasn't an alcoholic deadbeat fuck face. 

OOOOH then she started going to church and reading the Bible so she can feel like she became a better person, but she's still stuck in her own ways. I'm transgender, and the only people who didn't accept me were her and her lapdog ( my stepdad). Of course, she used religion as an excuse for her toxic ass ways. I still don't think she fully accepts me to this day. 

Now to the actual topic of the title: my brother moved many states away to be with his lover and is happy there. Of course my mother being the control freak felt like she was entitled to a text every day. It's not unreasonable, but the way she is when my brother takes days or weeks to respond is unreasonable. She would get on my case to text him to call her, but of course I barely took her seriously. Today, she told me that he still hasn't called. She pitifully whined ""I just don't get why he doesn't want to""

I wanted to say ""because you kept him from having a real life"" 

But it came out ""you weren't always the best mother""

And then came that piece of shit ugly ass spiteful face. I immediately barked ""don't give me that look, I'm done taking that from you!"" And immediately went to denial. I just left because she clearly can't handle the truth: that my brother and I went through so much bullying and so much loneliness because her control mattered more than to actually see us grow as individuals. It just makes me sad thinking she won't ever change her ways and that my world will get even smaller. Besides my BFF roommate, I have no friends and maybe losing my mother due to her stubbornness will leave me with practically no one in my world. "
"I am 19F and living in a religious household where my parents are stealing my money and human rights. I have a job which barely covers my bills, and i live in a small town where there aren’t many available jobs. My parents, rightfully, make me pay rent which i believe is too high. They yell at me to make money because im broke, but they take all the money i have left after i pay my bills. They still have control over my bank account. They have taken my passport which i was going to use to visit my long distance boyfriend. They don’t like the fact that i have a boyfriend who isn’t religious, and they believe he is only out to get me because him and i met online. For context, i have done a lot of checking and i know he is not some trafficker out to get me, and he is the best boyfriend ive had. They have stolen my passport, they steal all my money, they yell at me because im not religious, and they do nothing but berate me and tell me how i am a failure. They try to force their religion on me, which is illegal in my country. Stealing a passport is illegal. Taking my money for rent, without a legal rental agreement, is illegal. I want nothing but to escape but I can’t. I have no money, no passport, no support, no backup, nothing. They also have taken away my wifi, which i help them pay for. I don’t eat a lot because i don’t feel like being charged extra to survive. I barely have enough money to buy my own fucking shampoo and body wash. I struggle with multiple mental illnesses and can’t afford medication or therapy or any help and its only adding on to my helplessness. I have asked for a raise at work, for more shifts, tried looking for a second job or anything to make money. I am stuck in my room. I have a dog which they got me years ago who i can barely afford to feed, and they do nothing but yell at him when he gets excited. They told me they will not help me pay for his food. Ive chosen feeding him over myself sometimes, his food is expensive, as id anything in Canada. The only support i have is from my American boyfriend who lives hours away who I can’t even see because they’ve taken my passport. I don’t know what to do. I need advice. "
"His parents keep all his money, he has no other place to stay, and he cant get medication without them"
"My parents where super neglecfull in my life. They gave two shits about rasing us and I was stuck rasing all my siblings. They drank and never protected us when we needed is and always blames us for everything. Even when I got SS'd it was my own fault even though I was 10. However all of that changed when my brother was born. 


He was automatically the gem of the family. Suddenly he was the golden child and they had to protect him from all harm. They treated him like he was physically incapable of wrong and that he was the second coming of Jesus Christ in the sense. And boy did he abuse that. 

He has NEVER gotten in trouble for anything. He has killed multiple pets of mine and laughed about it, but they tell me he's younger so I shouldn't judge him too harshly. He's tried to stab me in my sleep before and has pulled a knife on me multiple times, and they just say I'm being overdramatic. Ive seen him grab my other siblings and beat the shit out of them for no reason and purposely walk up and punch them square in the face for no reason and laugh as they're crying. 

Its gotten to the point my mother has had to lock her room with deabolt in fear that he may try and get into the gun safe and hurt us or others. He knows he can get away with anything so he's constantly having ""adult interaction"" way before he's 18. He also has stolen, money, hygiene products, and a pearl necklace given to me by my grandmother to sell off. 

I'm afraid he's going to end up on the news one day for the worst reason possible. I know he's going to commit a crime so grauome and heartless that he'll get a movie made about him. 

My parents failed at raising us, but they created something even worse. They created an actual monster. Every time I look in his eyes they are black like death and look like every crazed persons eyes. I wished he had to struggle like we did, because maybe there would of been a chance of him being normal. I think it's to late for him now, and I don't think anyone can fix him. They just keep making excuses for the behavior and they keep giving him free passes out of life. He went to a therapist once, but he doesn't supposidly actually talk during those sessions.

I hate my parents. That may be harsh but I do. They created a truly awful being that will hurt some poor family some day and they'll still be on his side. I just wish that I could rip the DNA I shared with my brother and parents, off of me and throw it into a bin and walk away. "
"I'm having an awful Mental Health flare up, currently barricaded in ""my room"" that has A LOT of trauma associated with it. I can't sleep. I'm basically forced to be in this room 24/7 or deal with unwanted harassment or abuse when they spot me outside the bedroom. I'm having flashbacks. There's a park nearby and I'm really thinking about laying on the bench tonight.

My parents also like to burst into my room without my permission so I have something barricading it at the moment so they can't walk in while I'm asleep. Technically I need to move/I'm homeless. They lured me back in after a bad medical crisis left me unable to work. I think I need to find a shelter for DV victims. This isn't okay. I feel so crazy :(

Edit: these are the same people who called the police on me last year April and left me with nowhere to go that night that led me to literally having to flee asap without my cat and find housing. Idk why I came back. "

"how does one live long enough to finally escape their abusive parent? 

my father is overbearing and extremely abusive towards his children and the women with whom he has had children with. i have been telling myself i only have about a year or 2 left w him (depending on how my college admissions go).

i'm 17f btw and idk if i can do this w him much longer. i also have little siblings who have way more time left w him and idk how i'd feel if i kms and left them behind or if i went off to college and left them behind to suffer at the hands of him.

there's not much i can do rn bc he doesnt let us leave the house or go outside, so i can't get a job or anything and he won't take me to get some documents i need for college and some other stuff. 

idk what to do and i just feel so numb and lost.

any advice helps, sorry if this is kind of all over the place i'm kinda just ranting/word vomitting rn. "
"I (21F) decided to runaway today. I don’t know if it’s even considered that but I was badly beaten up by my mom today when I told her I wanted to move out and wanted to start my life after doing so she came to my room and begged me to stay and asked for my forgiveness but at that point I was so done. So I decided to just pack my things and quietly left. I’ve been her slave ever since I was a kid. I was physically and emotionally abused by her. 
I blindly stayed for years even after enduring so much pain because I felt bad for her for being a single mother. I have 5 others siblings; 2 in the Philippines ( 14yrs old and 6 yrs old ) and 3  ( 1 yrs old , 3 yrs old. And 5 yrs old ) here in Japan. We all have different fathers. And they all left I was left with the responsibility of feeding them and raising them. 
I feel so guilty for leaving them behind. But they’re too young to come with me. Especially my little sister who had always cried for me when I was being abused. 
Idk why I’m feeling so guilty for my abuser as well for leaving her to raise 5 kids. 

"
"Extremely neglectful to them mostly. But she also actively encourages her other older children to commit credit card fraud. She was recently arrested and the last thing she said to her 14-year-old son was, “looks like you’re going to have to take up the family business”. (That’s what she calls her fraud scheme.)

Now her 21-year-old daughter, who came all the way from Florida to attempt to kidnap my older brother’s children, wants to talk about how she’s not dumb because she’s the one “making money without even having to step a foot outside”. This is after her mom apparently didn’t even have any contact with her for YEARS. I’m thinking this whole entire family is fucked??

Their mom would also just straight up buy weed for her son and her other, younger daughter (12). She herself is a coke addict and would constantly bring strange people into her home where she had TWO INFANTS. They didn’t even have their own bedroom, she’d given their bedroom to their older brother and they just slept in the living room on a mattress.

Since my brother has finally realized she’s a crazy bitch who never wanted to be a hApPy FaMiLy with him, he’s been learning how to be an actual father. My mom is actually able to visit them now that she doesn’t have to deal with that wench either, and they’re literally different children. It just disgusts me that every time my mom reported her to CPS they did fuckall. Not even when she reported that they were found with really weirdly specific wounds 
😭😭 They just knocked on her door and shrugged when she didn’t open the door ig!!"
"I'm not totally sure if my parents are abusive or not, so I wanna see other peoples opinions



So my dad cheated on my mom when I was about 3-4 and he moved out shortly after. Before then, both my parents were absent in my life. Because my dad worked during the day, the only times I would see him would be early in the morning or late at night, and my mom worked night-shift so she would often sleep during the day. I wasn't mistreated, I got fed and watered, but I feel like I never had much interaction with them. 

After my dad moved out, me and mom left left to live with another man she found. He was an amazing guy until he began using drugs and asulted my mom one night. I did not witness it but I remember the day it happened. A little after that my dad met my stepmom. They started dating and she would often say things like ""I don't want a kid"" or ""I don't like kids"" in front of 5 year old me. Eventually she stopped after my mom confronted her about it, but the fact she even said anything like that really bothers me. 

I started public school for the first time right after my 6th birthday since I used to be homeschooled, I loved school and it was like a place for me to actually have fun. In second grade my best friend and her mom and sister moved in with me and my mom. I was so excited but me and my friend hated each other for the next two years. Her mom would always treat us unfairly, babying my friend and yelling at me. I understand I wasn't her child but still. My mom would often take me and my friend to the store or her work to avoid my friends mom, and I am pretty sure she played a major role in me being suicidal in 3rd grade (don't worry I got better)

Now, at my mom's house, several years later, there is stuff everywhere, the house is a huge fire hazard. It isn't as bad as those houses on that horders show though. And I think the place just stresses me out so much that I don't want to help clean up, instead I do things to keep my mind off of everything. My mom also talks about her problems with me, even after she has said it is a form of abuse. 

My dad isn't a big issue, but he is a very passive parent. He doesn't take me to doctors appointments or make sure I'm not getting into trouble. 

But I think my stepmom is the worst. Probably the best way to describe her is that it's like I'm walking of glass around her, one wrong move and it breaks. And lieing to her is like there is a crack in the glass and I try taping it, sometimes it still breaks and sometimes it doesn't. I don't get yelled at or hit, but I can't do anything I really enjoy without getting either scolded or in trouble. I am a therian and I do a sport called quadrobics which is where one runs and jumps on all fours. When I do quadrobics, my stepmom would say something like ""If you act like and animal we will treat you like and animal."" Even though I am just being myself. She is over-protective as well, I can't climb trees or talk to strangers online whatsoever. She has rules for me that she doesn't follow herself like how I am not allowed to interrupt people because it's rude though for some reason she is allowed to interrupt me. 

  
Anyway I could keep going and going about these people but I'm not going to. I don't want to write a whole novel lol. If anyone knows if this is abuse or not and if anyone has any ideas on how to cope with it I am all ears. I have tried therapy and journaling but neither are for me. Thanks!"
"Hi, I live in the UK, 22F, and I really want this story to be known. This is going to be long, because this is a decade worth of information, and I have issues with remembering times and orders of things, so it might get messy. This is also very unbelievable, but I assure you, I can prove this is all true.

My mom and my dad split up when I was a child, maybe 10ish. My mom stole money from my dad who worked hard to support us. While he was at work, a guy would come knock on our door which I'd sometimes answer. Big biker dude, he'd ask for my mom if I answered and it turns out he was selling her ketamine. I was just answering the door to her ket dealer as a literal child.

My dad kept ferrets and lurchers and my mom had a Chihuahua. When they split, she kicked him out and proceeded to starve his animals. The ferrets all starved to death. The lurches, mother and adult pup, were starved too. When RSPCA found them, the pup had only survived by eating the carcass of the mother. I think my mom hid them in a black bag. Her dog, the Chihuahua, was fine though. She lied about trying to commit suicide when confronted. I saw it all, and still have nightmares about that night.

She stopped me seeing my dad but my dad fought hard to try and see me. I can't remember much of this time, but she managed to get away with separating us. Guess the court just fucked up. She made me go by my nan's last name so I couldn't be found. My dad would never stop looking for me, nor his side of the family, but they had no idea she'd made me go by another last name.

She started going out with lots of different men at the same time. I remember seeing a new guy in the house each day. I remember asking why so many people were coming over while a guy was there once, and I got told off afterwards. 

This part gets especially messy. She meets a guy who sticks around. Big Irish guy, has a daughter. We end up living in a place with them. She leaves all our belongings in the house I grew up in. Didn't take my baby photos, clothes, anything of mine. Took her own stuff, though, and I think it all gets chucked in a skip when the house goes up for sale. Fresh start with the new guy I guess.
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, she started showing me pictures of intimate parts of the body. I was still a child, I couldn't have been older than 12. She gave me 'massages' and made me give her some. We were made to bath together and share a bed. Single bed, originally. I was molested. So fucking much. I didn't even know it was wrong or abnormal so I never said anything, I just carried on with things. There are lots of things from this time.

Started going to school. Secondary school, which was hard because when we went to live with the Irish guy she just took me after school one day and we never went back. Didn't do my GCSE's, so every school I went to treated me like I was stupid. Her and the Irish guy break up. Messy I think, got physical. She dumped me at the house of the friend I made for months. I didn't see her for months. Didn't hear from her. My friend got abusive, would beat me up when I went to eat food. I'd lock myself in the bathroom so she couldn't hurt me, she'd give me a plate of food to apologize. It would repeat. 

She came back, we moved into a place. Just us. She met a guy, he started grooming me. Somewhere before this we were in a hostel. I only found out recently when I was told, but it came back. I have memories that lead me to believe I was r*ped. 

This is already a long post, but I'm not even halfway through my story. I guess I'll carry it on another time. If you read this far, thank you. I've been so desperate for someone else to know what has happened. Someone outside of the few friends I have in my life right now.

Sorry if any of this doesn't make sense or such, I'm just typing it out the way it comes out of my brain. Rambling and stuff, at 12:22 at night.

Ciao"

"my mom emotionally abused me badly but my dad never found out bc he traveled for work a lot. he thinks I’m distant and unable to talk abt my emotions bc of him and thinks it’s bc of something he did. i can’t tell him abt my mom bc it could hurt their relationship and they love each other and i don’t want to taint my dads image of her. but i have no one to talk to and my dad is probably the only one who would understand bc he was abused when he was a kid. its just not fair that i had to go through all that just for my mom to act all nice about me now that I’ve moved out and talk about how such a great person I turned out to be and to act like she always loved me in front of my dad and on social media, and i have to live w it alone. it’s not fair that I had to go through that and now i can’t even talk to my dad or talk to him without crying anymore and what she did is hurting my relationship w my dad. in addition even if I told my dad he might not believe me bc emotional abuse is seen as less severe than physical and there’s no proof of it"
"Hello, I made a post in AskUK 3or so months ago about my mother's emotional abuse of my sister; [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1aw8lq3/should\_i\_report\_my\_mother\_for\_child\_neglect/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1aw8lq3/should_i_report_my_mother_for_child_neglect/)

They wouldn't let me post the update so I've resorted to trawling reddit for other places to seek advice so sorry if this is wrong too.   
  
On the back of that post I reached out to the NSPCC (UK Child Neglect / Abuse Charity) for support, they then reached out to my local social services on the back of this who then went to see and speak to my mother - they raised the concerns with her and had a little look around the house and that was it.

They didn't make any attempts to speak w/ my sister, with her mother telling her the social was happy and the case was being closed. I then reached out to the social myself, letting them know it was me and that I was concerned no-one has spoken to my sister.

They then set up her head of year at school to have a chat w/ her - with him reporting back to the social what she'd said. According to my sister he reassured her what was happening wasn't okay and he understood her feelings being in this position.

The social did nothing.

I kept the social up to date w/ any new developments from the home. Further instances of how my sister was spoken to, how this impacted her emotional and mental wellbeing and a recent incident where she had agonizing tonsilitis but her mother refused to acknowledge it or that she needed to go to a doctors - that is, until I told my sister I'd take her first thing. Only then did she agree something was wrong.

Following my last two further reports to the social, I haven't had any responses. I've noted they're welcome to get in touch and if what I was doing wasn't appropriate to please let me know, I'd be happy to leave them to their investigations I just wanted to offer more context of what was going on in the home.

Well today my sister has told me that her mother has let her know the case has been closed permanently. They aren't taking any more action. They've decided that I'm effectively being vindictive and trying to get my mother 'in trouble'. This info is coming from the mouth of my mother so I'm taking it with a pinch of salt as I know she'll be taking the closure as an absolute win and confirmation she isn't doing anything wrong. 

Further to this, they also told my mother everything my sister had said in that meeting w/ her year head.

All of this while knowing they didn't even speak directly to my sister once.

I'm at my wits end. Nothing has changed. My mother is an emotionally abusive and incredibly selfish person. I'm really concerned for my sister as she's about to go on to college and I don't want her mental struggles preventing her from going where she wants and getting to Uni. She's struggling enough as it is with her GCSEs  and has self harmed in the past. 

The house is covered in mould, years worth - my mother says this is all the fault of my sister - she's 16. It's not up to her to bleach a whole house. I still have to buy my sister food sometimes. I took her prom dress shopping, her t-shirt stank and had stains of mould on it. She starts conversations on topics she's passionate about with 'I know you won't care but..'

It breaks my heart and I don't know what to do - I don't have the space or money to house her until she's able to run off for Uni. We're looking at her moving in with her Grandmother for College but it's up in the air. Everyone seems to agree she's in the wrong but the official channels who are supposed to help can't be arsed to do anything, or even tell her mother that their relationship isn't healthy, whether they think it needs their intervention or not. 

I've had issues with my mother myself over the years (exploiting me for lifts, housework, money, being downright horrible when I moved out with my fiance, being absent during the planning and my actual wedding day) - I did want to talk these things through but she'd bail on any plans and at this point I've written it all off in place of just making sure my sister can be safe as she still lives with her. 

I'm sorry for the long post, I'm just kinda lost and my sister being subject to two more years of this shit is awful. "
"I'm posting this in a few places but I need advice, I want to move out of my dad's house, badly, and I want to take all of my stuff with me because I've lost all my belongings before. However, my dad will very much call the police and tell them I stole things when I did not, and I don't want to get in trouble for this as our local law enforcement seems to believe everything that comes out of his mouth despite the fact they've been over here every other week almost for domestic disputes with his girlfriend and he has given them no reason to believe him. We have a landlord who is a relative and my mom wants to have her there so she can watch the process and ensure I didn't steal anything but I worry that won't be enough. Any advice is insanely appreciated."
"I'll go first. My(24m) father often tells me that he'd never see my face of he had another son.
Today also he said the same thing and I feel awful."
"I'm 18 and I want to estrange, but my parents have done nothing but help me. My therapists see why I would want to leave, but everyone keeps telling me about how hard it's going to be, and tell me that they would be a fool to tell me not to stay, some even asking me over and over to stay in contact with them, at least through college so that they can help me pay.

My parents have always paid for everything for me, they've paid for my fancy private school, and they've paid for my wardrobe, which is way too large, and they've paid for all of my depression medication and hospital stays.

I, on the other hand, have never really tried to make our relationship better. I've wanted to estrange from them since I was 9, following a strenuous court case, my father driving across the country and attempting to take me away from my mother by force, him calling my mother horrible names and forcing me to agree, and my mother egging on my eating disorder, that started around 7-8, by telling me that I ate too much (despite being underweight), and that she didn't care if I starved myself as long as I didn't cry to her about it and bother her.

  
Throughout my childhood, my father has always been pretty angry, yelling at me, knocking the wind out of my by hitting me very hard in the stomach, and throwing stuff around my room, making me clean it again, when I didn't do it well enough the first time. He also fueled my eating disorder by telling me that I was too chubby (I wasn't, I just wasn't underweight for the first time in my life), and locking all the doors and windows in the house and screaming at me to run, while laughing at me. By this time though, I was already pretty distant towards him, and had been since I was around 6 years old. I'm not sure why I've been so resentful towards him my whole life, but I remember crying at most of his ""jokes"" towards/about me, and wishing on my 6th birthday that I could parent him and my mother to teach them how to act like adults (I really don't know what sparked this). 

  
In recent years, I fear that I have in some ways, stagnated in my mental growth. There have been many situations since I was young, and up until last year where I yell and scream at them and cry. During a wellness check last year, some police listened to me telling them that I felt my mother was emotionally abusive and gaslighting me, following her telling me that I could never mature as a person, and become fully healed like she is, and that it was crazy that I needed to heal anyways because I had never been through anything bad in life. She then proceeded to tell me to tell her all of my issues with her so that she could write them down, and present them to my therapist as reasons that I was ""f'ed in the head"".

  
My father also has a habit of saying very wild things when he's mad. Almost a year ago now, I told him that I didn't enjoy him and his mother calling me bad names, accusing me of doing things I would never even think of doing, and calling me and my hair ugly, especially when I'll get plenty of compliments on that style. I then told him that even if I looked horrible, and wouldn't get a job because of it, that I'd rather learn the hard way, that just take people's word on everything, because then I'd actually learn, and be able to apply those lessons elsewhere in my life. He responded with telling me that I'd end up on drugs, homeless, and with a gun shoved down my throat, and he said that he hopes before I get shot in the head, he hopes I remember him, and how if I had listened I wouldn't be about to die.

  
That being said, I also did something horrible, and sent him an email containing all of the things I've ever written about him, from English assignments, to text messages, to share with him all that I feel he's done wrong, and how much I disliked him, and the fact that it wasn't me blowing something that had happened recently out of proportion, but was in-fact something I had felt for years.

  
He still calls me though, and tells me he loves me, and to call more. Sometimes it is me who starts being rude first, I always give him one word answers, and have since middle school.

  
My mother helps out to. She buys me plane tickets to go see her, and sends me money periodically.  
It feels like as a kid I was hurt, but now I'm just the worst person alive, even if they have done horrible things recently. I mean even if they have been horrible, I've been closed off since I was a kid. I even had one therapist tell me that it felt like they were trying and I wasn't (this comment was made after weeks of family therapy, though neither of us mentioned his comment on me being a homeless drug addict in any future where I don't follow his every word).

  
I don't know. I feel like I'm going insane trying to figure out if it is me that ruined this, that drove them to be worse to me over the past few years. Though I've wanted to estrange for half my life now, I don't know whether they've been abusive, or if I've been sowing problems, and am now punishing them by trying to get away."
"
My parents are going through an awful divorce. My mom has dealt with a love of verbal and some physical abuse over the years from my dad who has a lot of mental health issues and really bad anger issues. He thinks she’s the devil basically and is constantly cursing at her and being terrible to her and about her to me and in front of my younger siblings. I’m doing my best to make it better for my siblings and I’m stuck in the middle between my parents so much and it’s so awful. My dad uses me to regulate his emotions and guilts me into feeling bad for him and I tell him what he’s doing is wrong all of the time and I defend my mom all of the time but I also feel guilty and I know he’s in a lot of pain. I’m too empathetic. But he thinks I’m terrible and on my mom’s side and she’s lying to people about him and ruining his life. My mom thinks I deny the abuse and collude with him and support him. I hate myself, I can feel the anger and the hatred from them and I’m disgusted with myself. I feel like such a bad person all of the time. I don’t deserve to feel good, I don’t deserve to eat, I don’t deserve comfort but I want it so badly. I’m 23 and I just want someone to hug me and call my baby and sweetheart and tell me I’m doing good and they will fix this for me. I’ve tried so hard to take care of everyone and protect my siblings and I love people so much and I feel other peoples emotions so much and I’m failing at everything."

"# This is NOT an OFFICAL cry for help. Let me describe the situation.

It's a normal Friday afternoon until my mom goes to my dad’s room and starts yelling at him. I try to stop my mom, but it doesn't work. 

I say everything I can. I try to get my mom to calm down, but once she starts, there's no convincing her. Whenever my dad and I try to talk to her logically, she rambles about being perfect and how she can’t. She doesn't show love, refuses to take me to schools I got admitted into because of my “lack of academic eagerness and achievement” and doesn't know how to encourage me. All my mother can do is insult me, and try to toy with my emotions negatively. I have let it happen for way too long. Every week, she taunts me at least once. It usually occurs when we're in an Argument and I try to fight back. “Here's my phone, go call 911 if you want,” she says to me, knowing that as a kid, I don't have the guts to do it.

Every day my mom makes my and my dad’s life a living hell. My dad does so much for her but she doesn't even acknowledge it. Now I've reached a point. I can’t hold it in for much longer, but I don't want to do anything rash. My questions are: What can I do to prevent abuse? Is divorce a rational option? Can I report my mother for domestic abuse and if yes, what type of evidence do I need?"

"So long story short, my dad has high blood pressure issues and my sister has severe depression. Pretty sure these manifested from events in the house. My mother has always been really abusive, growing up it was to my dad and even now to the point his blood pressure is very high and she berates him. She states she does nothing wrong and he says he tries to avoid her. She has these bouts of screaming and shouting over small things like someone moving her cooking spoon from its place for example and and my sister has panic attacks and she carries on screaming while my sister states she is struggling to breathe. I’m worried this will push my sister to the edge. Growing up I was called ridiculous things and even told to die at one point. I started self harming and now I’m married with a good man and I stopped the self harming.  I have always been berated by her however I don’t like the effect it’s having on my family. I’m at a loss of what to do. In front of everyone else she looks like she can’t hurt a fly. I thought I was being weak until my husband joined the family and he was shocked at what he saw. He’s uncomfortable and can’t stay in my parents house long. She doesn’t have any mental health illnesses as far as I’m aware. I don’t know how to cope or get help. If I take any action against her she blames my father. I have never seen someone with as many narcissistic qualities as well. Oh and she also turned her own brothers and sisters against each other by talking about them all behind their back. Writing this all down makes me realise how crazy it sounds.

"My alcoholic hateful dad had been insulting me, belittling me and as a result I ended up suicidal, with severe mental illnesses, negative self talk, core beliefs (I'm a failure, valueless, unlovable, broken (as in a machine), and I'm someone who shouldn't have ever been born).

But whom I hold accountable the most is my mother. She has been complicit, scaring me into staying silent about the abuse I endured. I'm having recurring daily nightmares about her.

A few days back I got an idea. Let's open up with my story and share it with... her work colleagues. Let's send an e-mail to every hospital personal where she works describing in vivid details the abuse I had to endure. Let each person judge her for her actions. I've been told it's cruel and I wholeheartedly agree with this. I just can't stand her getting away with everything.

She doesn't have an intellectual capacity to come up with an answer more profound than a denial. Even if she manages to convince some of the staff that all I've written is nonsense, the family reputation will get tarnished forever. It's satisfying to imagine having my revenge after being told to stay quiet all of my life. To speak at last, speak so loud that everyone will hear and make their judgement. "

"in no particular order:

- took me aside in the pet store right before i was going to pick out a hamster i'd finally convinced my parents to get for me, and then pressured me on the spot to get a rat instead. i got the rat

- talked so much during family therapy that my therapist had to tell him to shut up

- when i asked him to drive me to the hospital because i was suicidal, he drove in circles in the parking lot until he'd successfully pressured me into letting him drive me home

- claimed he was tough on me because i was constantly failing (and i was), only to turn around and treat my high-achieving younger sister the exact same way when i moved out

- promised to stand up for me when i had an episode and got too overwhelmed to speak, then immediately pressured me to speak to the director of my school in a room with half my teachers in it before he'd take me home

- guilted me for not wanting to go on an international trip with my entire step-family during COVID lockdowns

- almost made a family friend homeless during winter by kicking her & her kid out of the garage he was forcing her to pay rent for.... because he wanted the space for his new jeep"
"My mum has been hitting me since I was 5 (I'm 15 now), to be more specific only when shes angry. I love my mum so much but when shes angry it's really bad, she screams, hits, and doesn't let me talk. I'm not allowed to explain my side of the story. My dad also just tells me to shut up and in my house my mum is always right. Even though my parents don't want me talking back or even explaining my side they always tell me that me expressing my feelings is an issue. I've had trouble expressing my feelings ever since my mum became abusive. For some reason I have always found it much more comfortable to sit by myself and cry.

People (my closest friends) have suggested that I tell somebody about this, but the problem is I don't want anything happening to my mum. Plus she would definitely be angry if I told anyone about this. So I'm very stuck on what to do."
"i, 16f (17 on the 29th) have been dealing with an alcoholic mother my entire life. my mom is 54 and a single mother, up until last year. in 2022 i forced myself into foster care because of her neglect and abuse onto me. 

i have 2 older sisters, J 28F and R 22F. J is disabled and has had multiple health issues since she was 14. R has mental issues (bipolar) and she currently has custody of me. J moved out 3 years ago and R moved out 2 years ago.

i’m currently the only child who lives with my mom, alongside her boyfriend who is disabled as well. i lived with R for nearly a year but she gave me back to mom because she couldn’t afford the items i needed. while i’ve been back with mom (moved in october 2023) she’s gotten drunk way over 30 times, with police being called 4 times.

my entire life i’ve dealt with my mom and her abusive antics, and my sisters never allowed me to get support since they were scared i would be lost in the foster care system, and get more trauma than i already had. cps was called constantly back then, and i always got yelled at by mom when she told me i had to clean the house up before cps arrived. 

i’ve recently been able to start driving on my own and getting my own job, and of course, she will come into my room at night and tell me to drive her down the street to the gas station. i tell her i legally can’t do that, since i don’t want to get pulled over and the police see a 16 year old driving her drunk 54 mother to get cigarettes.

tonight has been one of those awful nights of her drinking, and she straight up told me i just need to move out and leave since she “doesn’t need anybody anymore “. so i told her “alright, give me a date and i’ll get out.” then she immediately said i twisted her words up and i’m a selfish brat. 

my partner has a home i can go to while i wait to be 18 and officially leave home, R (who has legally custody of me) says i’m able to go there, since she feels bad she can’t take care of me and obviously my mom can’t either.

i went to the ER 2 nights ago (the er she…. works at too..) and they prescribed me medication for my illness. my mom came into my room yesterday morning and told me to not take any of the medications? she never gave me an explanation as to why.

i don’t know what to do anymore. i struggle with multiple mental issues as well, but my mom always says it’s my fault and i need to get help. yet… she doesn’t ALLOW me to go to appointments. she’s cancelled all of my appointments after i keep begging her , saying i need to go to the doctor, she always ignores me.

i need to get out before i go even more insane, i just don’t know the best way to get out though. my partner is allowing me to move in with them, but they are a far distance away. i just don’t know what to do anymore"

"My mother has always hated me and she doesnt bother hiding it anymore. On top of treating me like absolute rubbish, she blames me for the way SHE treats and talks to me! I’m beyond tired and drained from the toxic merry go round im trapped on. I wont go into all the ways she traumatized me as a child and displayed her hatred for me. My mothers never been on my side of any argument or fight, she sides with ANYONE else and makes me out to be the bad guy. She’s never once apologized to me for all the messed up things shes done and said to me. She’ll blame me for the way she physically and verbally attacks me and says things like “you depress me” and “its just because ___” as if those are excuses?? Recently ive been out of work for some time and shes been holding over my head the fact she allows me to live with her as if im just her friend. She chose to raise a child and somehow thinks providing a roof over my head is the ultimate sacrifice. Today we got into a heated argument because she’s a spaz and has been treating me like shit in front of people amd when i stick up for myself….im told im playing victim and im dramatic. Today my mother called me a loser, a bitch and a fatass bitch. Ive had body issues my entire life due to her and people in my family commenting on body all the time. So just crazy to hear my mother admit thats how she sees me. She woke me up saying “youre about to be homeless”. Heavily implying that she’ll kick me out so now im looking for a new place to live. Im just disappointed that shes so old and will never change. "

"My mom and dad physically abused me while I was a kid up until I was 18, I learned yesterday that they were in their late 40s and early 50s in this period. I was bewildered to find this out, since at that age I would just expect anyone to know better than to hurt a child. Anyway, this led me to reliving all the things that they did. In specific, there is one episode that I remember vividly - they took my glasses off so I couldn't see (and also because they would frequently break them in their beatings and didn't want to spend money to get them repaired) and then the two of them closed me in a room and then hit me. The next day, I chopped off my hair and called the police. The police didn't really do much, they asked me if I was getting good grades in school (I was). My mother was a lot more abusive than my father, who would apologize afterwards, but he was also emotionally abusive and controlling. They normalized all of this as being culturally acceptable.

Anyway, I've been away from home since I turned 18. I left the country to study outside of. In this period, contact with them was once a week and for 2-3 years I was not speaking to my mother at all. In this period, my father came and convinced me that she was sorry and she loves me and I began speaking to her again around COVID in 2021. Since then, I feel that I constantly lift myself up but I'm dragged down by interactions with her. She repeatedly treats me like a child and tries to take over my life when invited into my home (I live alone and separately). When I point something out, she yells and throws a fit like a child. One recently scarring moment was when she was driving me and my brother in a car and then we got into an argument and she tried to scare me by driving the car in a zig-zag and reckless manner, I hit my head onto the ceiling of the car and she said it would be better if we all just died, she would kill us all (me, my brother and her).

The thing is, I've decided I'm going to cut her off completely, but I still want to maintain a relationship with my father. I think I do like him. But it's very hard for me to move on from what happened. I am frequently triggered and reminded of the things he did - one of the big ones being forcing me into a career that I never wanted and making me give up opportunities that were truly exceptional (like a full ride to a PhD at an ivy league college pursuing my topic of interest). When I am reminded of his and their actions - for example while watching a movie or reading a post on Reddit or some other interaction, I admittedly call him and start yelling at him. I am only yelling and not hitting or anything, but it is abusive because abuse exists in the yelling. And it just brings me down for a couple of days. And then I spend time trying to make up. I don't know what to do. I don't think it's fair for me to ""forgive and forget"", because things have been repeated even recently. But I don't want to be so entirely loveless either. I don't know how to depart from this cycle. Please help me. "
"(posting this as a way to cope w my situation) hii so  i 17 f have a mom 48 f, tdy she came home after work with her glasses on (its kinda important) she was at the main entrance of the house  and my bf was  there as well, when i went downstairs to open the gate i had my cat in my hand, i opened the gate and let them both in, mom had to go somewhere else that day and she had to take her glasses, she went upstairs to change and she didnt know where she put  em and demanded for me to look for them, i didnt find them, but somehow it was my fault bc i went to open the gate with my cat in hand and that distracted her a lot, she almost yanked my hair infront of my bf bc she got angry at everyone for the fact that she lost her glasses, she yelled at me and forced me to look for her glasses, and after the event she went home, barged into my room and trashed everything she could get her hands on (luckily she didnt hit me bc she usually does).and now shes in her room crying abt how her chest hurts and she keeps justifying how somehow  its all mt fault , lowkey idk what to do "

I'm 17 and I'm not going to go into much depth about my life but my parents are terrible helicopter parents and I plan on removing all forms of contact but I feel like I'm unprepared for living life on my own. I desperately need tips here's the stuff I have/going to do:

-i have some money saved up for rent money (roughly 3 months where I live) and I plan on saving more by donating fluids. 

-when I turn 18 in going to ask for any documents relating to me: social security, birth certificate. Any other documents needed for a U.S. citizen? I feel like I'm missing some. 

-buying a new phone and blocking them everywhere

-moving out while my parents are on vacation to a place I wont tell them about
about

-I have looked at places near me but I havent looked in person or checked any places out or met with anyone. 

-i will also need to find my own insurance so any good companies come to mind for car, health, etc.? 

-i have stable income but I may or may not move jobs, should I wait till after the move?

-I have a credit history as my mother has a card under my name but connected to her somehow. But I have not taken out any form of loan although I will be taking out one in the near future(roughly 4k)

"Hello,

My brother was a single parent until a couple of years ago and I have just found out that he is insulting his daughter. He has anger bouts any she is scared of him. She fawns in the hope that it’ll get better and she has asked me to keep silent about it because she is scared of repercussions.
It drives me mad and I am not sure what I can do besides listening and being there.
Would any of you have advice on the best way to react to this ?

Thanks

"This includes physical violence. Im crying right now as I'm writing this and I'll probably delete later, I need to get this off my chest. I'm a 17F, just finished my junior year of high-school. I grew up in an extremely toxic household but I didn't know it at the time, i thought getting regularly beat for something bad you did was normal. Whenever me or my other 3 sisters acted out of place, we would be beat and shoved into the closet or the bathtub and left for sometimes hours, if any of us left without him saying we could, well i think you could guess what happened. We would be thrown out of the house during winter with nothing but a t shirt and pants. I would be grounded for months for a stupid reason or he would break my electronics- my phone was shattered, as well as my school laptop. Currently I'm getting my car taken away forever because I said I didn't want to work at a job he wanted me to work at. I retaliated of course, and wouldn't give him the keys to my car. It escalated extremely quickly with him screaming at my face and he started throwing breaking things in my room. As soon as he threatened to hurt my animals I gave in and just gave him the keys. He hurts everyone and everything. When he eventually feels bad, he would buy us things or take us out somewhere, acting all nice as if he didn't just beat us. I feel like it's had my childhood ripped away from me, constantly feeling uncomfortable in my own home- now I'm an anxious person and it takes me so long to trust anyone. Wow that was a lot "

Looking for some insight here. I grew up in an abusive/ highly religious family system…as a young child I was SA’d by my dad, and physically abused by both parents. Alcoholism, emotional abuse and and toxic religion were also a big part of my childhood. My mom and dad have swept things under the rug, downplayed a lot, and flat out denied or “ forgot” many things. They both responded with anger, and have tried to guilt and shame me for speaking the truth. 
In many ways my mom was a victim herself, but sadly throughout her life she was never able to see my dad and their marriage for what they were. She denies that any abuse took place and is protecting my dad. 
I haven’t had any sort of relationship with them for the last couple of years, and have pretty much reconciled myself to the fact that I need to keep it that way. Recently though, I’ve been struggling more with my sisters who still have ongoing interactions/connections with them. They didn’t experience everything that I did, but there was still a lot. And although they believe me that I was SA’d, they are not convinced that it was our dad, and none of them have confronted my parents about how they are treating me. 
I’m wondering where to go from here…should I try to maintain some sort of relationship with my sisters, or remove myself from the picture? It would be an easier call to make if it were just me, but I have kids who miss seeing their cousins. 
Needless to say, my husband is extremely upset about everything that happened and doesn’t want our family to have anything to do with my parents and the sisters who see them regularly. If the situation were reversed, I’d feel the same way, but because it’s me, and these are the people I grew up with, I’m struggling. Any insights appreciated. 🙏🏼"

"One of my earliest memories from childhood goes back to when i was no more than 3 years old. I was in the preschool parking lot with my mom and dad. My mom would dig her thumb into the bottom of my shoulder bone, where it really hurt, to make me cry. Obviously she did it so smoothly my dad never noticed. I remember screaming and crying in pain from the top of my lungs and she was so cynically saying “awww poor baby why are you crying” and continue and continue. I remember my dad just standing there thinking it was me. This behavior continued throughout my life. Once she got better with her technology, she would film me crying. I remember growing up the abuse had gotten so bad by the time i got to school i was always to torn up. When i was 8, i ran away to my neighbors house for help and he called child protective services. The problem though is that she is so good at pretending to be the best mom, so they did nothing to help me. 
I still managed to make friends though. The problem was whenever i made friends she would get in the way of my relationships with them. I remember in 4th grade she asked one of my guy friends if she was prettier than me. I hope he doesn’t remember that. Whenever i got close to someone, she would ruin the relationship, and sometimes even yell at my friends. Flash forward to senior year of high school: i had gotten into an argument with one of my friends and my mom saw her at starbucks and threatened her. Obviously her mom called the cops on my mom. To this day, my mom blames that on me, blames me for getting the cops called on her. She accuses me of drugs and being involved with the cartel. Currently she is accusing me of plotting a hate crime to kill her with cartel people. The most absurd things come out of her mouth. I don’t understand it. I genuinely try so hard to be good to her, and i have tried so hard in my life to be successful. I am at a top university right now and her facebook is filled with all my accomplishments she takes from my linkedin. She takes credit for every one of my accomplishments. When all she has done is make me want to kill myself from the youngest age because i never thought i would be able to escape her. Im back home for summer now and its absolutely miserable. I forgot how abusive and toxic she was. I dont know how i am going to push through these next months. I would cut her out but i have a younger sister who needs my love. 



Her behavior just doesnt make sense to me. She acts like everyone is a threat to her . Accuses people of drugs, gang violence, etc. but really its only her that is the problem.

 There is so much i have to say though and since i am on a rant i want to say one more thing. From a young age she started telling me my dad was a pedophile. She wouldn’t let me wear shorts or anything revealing around the house because of him. She told me it wasnt normal for him to hug me and that he always stares as me weird. So i grew up fearing my dad only to realize he wasnt even a problem. But they are 23 years apart. "
theres deffo some sick twisted reason like what
like ever since i was young my mom used to verbally bause me like everyday

how tf can my mother say that my child abuse scars are self harm just to defend herself and so she doesn't get in trouble
so strange
like their reaction does not quantify what happened.before i got skapped for complainign their was no cereal left like wtf
like ther is no logical reason that you should slap a two year old and force her to kneel down in a corner just bceause she snatched some choclates after another girls hand

"Ok so I was at my bf's but my dad knows them as my bsf. He called like 30 times in 3 mins. My ringer was off so I didn't hear it. He went to their house cuz we were out somewhere with their mom. I called back and he was yelling abt my room cuz it wasnt thoroughly clean. I had to go home even tho I was supposed to stay the night. At home I was yelled at for A WHILE. I was crying in the bathroom more than I ever had cried b4. 
We were yelling at eachother through the door. When I came out of the bathroom he was really pissed and yelling at me. We fought for a while and I ended up having a panic attack. I could barely breathe, I was gasping for breath, grasping at my chest, and abt to fall backwards. He looks at me and tells me to calm down, stop being dramatic, and breathe. He told me if I kept it up I'd never see my friend(bf) ever again, be shipped to a private school, and a boarding school. I was freaking out and didn't know what to do. I'm grounded for 2 weeks and he hasn't taken my phone YET. It's also break rn and I just wanted to spend some time with my bf. He's completely disregard it from that point. Edit: I'm gonna add a little more context abt my bf. They're gender fluid and were born as a girl. My dad thinks that he's just my best friend. It's nothing to do with them for him. It's a lot to do with them for me tho. They are my safe space. I was told I could stay the night then I was later in the day told he never said that even though he did and watched me leave with them. More context abt me: I am a transmasc (female to male). Me and my partner have been dating for 5 and a half months. We write each other letters in ELA. Im not tonna say the whole letter but I'll break it down. They said that they love me very very much and they hope that this won't be a dumb highschool relationship. In my letter I also said a lot but I told them ik it won't I'm not going anywhere."
"So a little context I was mentally and physically abused growing up and when I got older I started abusing drugs. I’ve always had issues sleeping, as in sleeping for way too long but I would very rarely dream and if I did it was apocalyptic fighting for my life. Well recently I quit abusing drugs and I find myself having these end of the world dreams daily and they are super vivid I can remember every single detail. 
Has anyone else experienced anything like this? The dreams aren’t necessarily scary it’s almost like I enjoy them though I absolutely hate scary movies.

"Just been wondering about this since I don't think I'll ever really recover.

Has anyone here recovered either fully or mostly from the abuse they suffered as a child?

I understand that this place in some ways is not the best place to ask this. I imagine that a lot of the people who completely or mostly recover are not on this subreddit (anymore). But I'm not sure where else to ask the question so..."
"You've probably already seen this story in this community, but as a kid I remember one day my dad was angry for some reason. He walked up to my brother punched him in the nose and made his nose bleed. It wouldn't stop bleeding for a while and we almost had to go to the hospital. I did not protect him somehow like an older brother is supposed to do. What bothers me the most about it is that I didn't think much of it. I actually laughed at my brother. I thought stuff like that was normal. I failed to show him any kind of empathy. This is why I feel I can't get close to others. Because I know I will hurt them due to my lack of empathy. I don't want to hurt anybody. I can't be trusted."
"I F19, am back at home living with my parents after developing a chronic illness at university. My parents swear up and down that they will treat me like an adult. They haven't and its been frustrating but its fine because at least I'm not paying rent. So let me start off by saying this, my dad is a veteran with ptsd and bipolar disorder, so his life has not been easy by any means. Neither has my moms. From as little as 3, I remember my dad being angry all the time, for no reason too. I remember coming home to him strangling my dog one day because the dog made my dad mad by making noise. I've feared him ever since. And even though he gets help through the VA, its never gotten any better. I always feared that he might hurt my sister, mom, or I. A few years back, my sister who was 17 at the time, was upset because her school gave her a big project to do over the weekend and my dad was forcing her to do the chores, so I stepped in and did the chores so she could focus on school, no big deal at all. Well, my dad put our dogs outside in the blistering heat, and my sister tried to let my moms dog in because he couldn't breathe in the sun like that (boston terrior). Well he got angry and said he would kill that dog, and my sister started crying, so he got even more mad and stormed after her and said he would snap both of our necks in a second and not feel bad about it. So I went to our garage and sent my mom a text, basically the equivalence of a goodbye because I thought we would be dead by the time she got home at 11 that night from work. Well my mom and dad fought and she apologized to us and he swore he would get help. Well, for a while he didn't do anything wrong, and then he slowly started again. My sister was gone so all he had to get angry at was me. I refuse to help him with any projects because he gets angry and i have panic attacks and start trembling uncontrollably and you can't build a porch when you are trembling like crazy. He also is unemployed right now due to being on disability from the VA, so he gets bored, and he has this image in his mind that women are below him and that because i'm a daughter, i should do his laundry and get his food and do his chores, and he refuses to put his trash in the trashcan and leaves it all around the house. I'm returning to a local university in a few months, so I'm trying to count down the days. He gets angry when my grandmother calls my mom, and says he wishes she would disappear, she's never done anything but tried to care for him. I fell asleep the other day because I'm sick, and he handed me this remote to the ac, well I didn't know why he did that and neither did he, so i sat it on the tissue box and it accidentally fell in, no big deal, except i woke up to him quiet yelling at my mom about where it was, and i heard him tell her that he was going to beat me up, and he was dead serious. Of course, he has no clue what i'm talking about when i mentioned it to him while he was in a good mood today. And then he started working outside this evening and was mad I was doing college preparations and couldn't stop and help him, and he walked through the house holding a screwdriver and said he was going to stab us (my mom and i) as his idea of a joke i guess? But i know he wasn't joking, he always tries to hide it as a dark humor joke i guess. But he also beats our dogs, especially this one old dog of ours, she's the sweetest little girl, and my mom originally didn't want anymore animals after our last group died because it was too hard, and he said we needed pets, so he took my mom to visit this pig (he knew my mom is soft-hearted) and so we brought the baby pig home because he was being abused, and now my mom is trapped with my dad. I know thats why he did it too, if she didn't have the animals she could leave him and be able to go to her moms house and he didn't want that. You can't easily lift a full grown pig, not a hog, but pigs are still fat and heavy either way. I just wish he could understand the pain he's put us through, whether he meant to or not. I understand he had a bad childhood and a hard life, but now my sister and I are really messed up and not even medication can help. I want to get out so bad but I can't bring myself to leave knowing my mom and animals could get hurt, and my mom would actually try to hurt herself if she didn't have her animals... I just hate that I have to live this way when I never asked to be born... The hardest part of it all is the fact that I still love him, and the thought of leaving him makes me sick, because I still have hope that one day he might turn out to be the dad I always needed him to be... Anyways thanks for reading this, I just needed somewhere to vent about this I guess without worrying my family or burdening my friends. Advice is welcome! Also I would like to add, just because someone is mentally ill or has Bipolar disorder, that does not automatically mean they are abusive or toxic, so no stigmatizing please. "
I don’t have a good relationship with my parents. They treat me very poorly and I have some family friends that I’m with at least 5 times a week and have been for years and I’m still really close with them and talk almost every day. They are like parents to me and love me like I’m their own child. I wanted to know if it would be okay to ask them if they would be by child’s “grandparents”? I want them to be an important part of my child’s life like they are mine. Not sure what to do. Need opinions! 
"I (F22) have just had enough of living at home. My little sister (F14), is still in junior high so she has no place to really go except enrolling in her high school come summer term next year. I have the opportunity to move out next summer, because I am thinking of pursuing a masters degree in a city or province away from my home. I just don't know what's going to happen when I am not there to mitigate the domestic abuse my parents engage in, the arguments and violence that just occurs in my household.

  
For context: my home has always had its share of abuse. My father is physically and verbally abusive, and has been abusive towards my mother and I ever since I can remember. His physical abuse stopped when I turned 18, after an argument we had that left me with purple bruising around my stomach. I finally stood up to him and told him to stop abusing me once and for all. I essentially threatened to runaway. Our home was content for a few years after that. Until I turned 21, he and I were rebuilding our relationship. But last summer he had an affair with a person from our community and this really destroyed our family. His stupidity continuously lasted for months. From August 2023 to the present day, our family has not had peace. My mother has endured and tremendous amount of physical abuse and emotional damage. She has also become very abusive towards us and my father. Mentally tormenting us with her emotions, outburst and back handed comments. It's a complete war zone. The courts and the police have been involved, but my parents rather stay together in an extremely toxic enviornemt. They have cultivated the most gruesome space for my sister and I to live in, we are completely overwhelmed each day. I try my best to handle it all, be there for everyone and take it so that my little sister is spared, but she has bared witness the violence too unfortunately.

With all this happening at home, I was going through a siginificat amount of suffering in my previous relationship. My ex was mentally and verbally abusive. I should have left the first time I saw the signs, but at least now I know where the mindset of ""staying with an abusive partner"" came from. It has been demonstrated to me my entire life. My mother even persuaded and encouraged me to stay with this individual. She told me that I will never find better. 

  
The only silver lining I can find in all this, my little sister and I got really close. Even with our age gap we are able to communicate better, reflect, relate and have each other's backs. 

Now I have the opportunity to leave. Financially it will be a strain, but I rather deal with financial struggle than lose my battle to mental health because of the chaos at home. 

How do I leave my little sister though? Will she be okay? Will my parents end up killing each other if I am not home to control everything? 



Please Help:("

Title is pretty self explanatory. Tonight my dad dropped a framed picture and it shattered all over the floor. He reacted to this inconvenience in his usual rational way by screaming, swearing, throwing things across the room, and threatening to kill himself. He leaves and slams the door, leaving us to clean up (because for some reason it’s always our responsibility). 

He comes back 10 minutes later screaming at my mom for something completely irrelevant. Something to do with how she works too much and it’s not how a family should be (ironic coming from him - an abusive narcissist). My mom doesn’t make that much money and earns her salary from commission, meaning she has to work a shit ton. 

This argument had nothing to do with the original reason why he got so upset but it always somehow comes back to us. He threatened to leave, saying “this is the last f**king time I’m saying this otherwise dad will one day disappear.” And then screaming “IS THAT F**KING CLEAR” to my mom while she’s cleaning his mess on her hands and knees. 

I can’t take this anymore. It’s constant walking on egg shells and he knows he completely controls the family since he makes more money than my mom. I’m an only child and can’t live like this anymore but if I leave I’m scared he’ll eventually do something to my mom and I won’t be here to stop him. I can’t even bother trying to help her because she will end up projecting her anger onto me instead of my dad

I’ve been taking antidepressants that have seemed to help my depression but how am I supposed to get any better when I’m surrounded by this?"
"So I'm f15 and I weigh 60 kgs, not overweight but I've been insecure of my weight since I could spell weight. This summer I wanted a glow up, I wanted to get skinny basically so I started starving myself, I've done it before, it's just earlier I lied I ate and had a bad stomach but this time I did the mistake of telling them the truth, my mother is the better parent she's a good mom but my dad...
I hadn't eaten for 2 days and all of a sudden when I'm making coffee in the kitchen which also took so much self convincing that I should finally have something and I was going to make a cappuccino. He came and started calling me a mf and how I'm mad and have i gone mad to not eat and I was submissive to it all until he started shouting on my mother which he always does for someone else's faults and i screamed that it's not her fault and my grandfather came and told me how my dad loved me and it pained him to see me starving which ik was lie. I went to my room and my father told me I'm a fcking bitch and not deserving of anything and if I get his anger up he will kill me. After somethings my mom said to him he just came to hug me out of nowhere, everytime he cusses me out to the point where I won't say such things to a rock let alone my daughter and he never says sorry but just hugs me and acts like nothing happened. This time I didn't let him hug me and he threatened to beat the shit out of me again and left saying that how I wish he was dead and how we ruin his day and my mother told me I was disrespectful. 
After that I went into the shower and screamed for half an hour and TW cut myself- 
I feel like i didn't deserve all that and if he was concerned he could have just told me that it is important to eat and he can't see me hurting but he chose to call me a mf and how he didn't want to go through the trouble of getting me to a hospital. I'm sorry i just needed to rent, I feel like he will break me soon if he's like this 
PS -basically he was having a bad day and ofc he takes it out on me"

Preface; my ex wanted me to get an abortion for me to have a chance with him again and to hang out with me for this festival. I lied to him saying I did it but then out of spite when he stood me up I told him I was pregnant and sent his parents the ultrasound pics 


First of all, I want to say I am getting help. I just work full-time so it’s hard to find an available counselor when I’m working so this weekend was EDC Las Vegas, which is known as a huge music festival that happens in Vegas my ex told me he would hang out with me all weekend if I acted properly I’m not going to lie. I did take a little bit of mushrooms And he decided to hang out with me all weekend. He said he promised he would see me then he stood up. I told his mom and dad that I’m still pregnant sent them the ultrasound pictures and then I ask his friends where he was during the concert the day he stood me up.

 I asked all of them and then I told him sorry I was acting crazy. I’m pregnant with my ex and that’s why I’m behaving like such.  Then I was really mad that he stood me up, but I didn’t realize how Mad I  was when I told his parents I was pregnant and his friends. so I told him meet me downstairs outside of your hotel because I deserve a kiss and a hug and he didn’t really want to like I’m outside so we came down and then he just gave me a huge hug and then he yelled in my ear saying you’re so fucking stupid you broke your promise. You promised me you would do the abortion and that was the promise you made in order for me to hang out with you during this festival. I fully regret telling him I’m still pregnant because he fully believed I did the abortion already so I should’ve just kept that a secret.


 I just acted so emotionally crazy because he stood me up the day. I then acted more crazy on Monday or excuse me Tuesday. I called his work six times and then his boss called me saying if I keep harassing him he will call the police. I really hope he doesn’t do that reason to get a restraining order due to what I ’m doing. I really like my ex and I would do anything to get him back but I know he’s not going to stay with me forever so I’m keeping this kid and making sure it has the best life I can. Anyways, I know I made some post on this sub Reddit, but I am not allowed to comment on my own post because I don’t have enough comment karma so if you want to direct message me feel free. I need people to talk to. I have a discord if you want to add me, I need support such as someone to talk to. I really want to work it out with my ex but what should I do? 


Should I just leave him alone? I went so crazy and I felt so bad for doing that. I am slowly falling in love with the kid,  but I had so much fun with my ex. I don’t want to lose him you guys, but with everything I did with me having no self-control and no common sense and no respect for his privacy going on the verge of blackmailing him like I’m telling all his friends and family that pregnant, so the people who say I should give it up for adoption this is my baby and I’m going to take good care of my baby. Do you guys think I blew it with my ex? Should I stop caring about my ex and just focus on the baby? "
"TL;DR: I (18F) survived an abusive relationship that worsened in college, leading to cheating and violence. After ending it, I lost my friends and returned to my abusive mother’s home. Now, I'm struggling to focus on my studies while dealing with feeling completely alone.

I (18F) survived an abusive relationship, and I couldn’t feel more alone. I met him (19M) during high school, and we fell hard for each other. Our relationship was good back then. He was there for me when my mother kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go. However, it all changed when I got to college. He was upset that I couldn’t spend as much time with him because I was focusing on school. I’m a pre-med student, so school can get very consuming at times.

A couple of months later, he came over to spend the night (I had no roommate). That morning, I woke up to use the bathroom, and something told me to check his phone. I landed on Reddit, where I discovered several messages from different girls and couples. In the messages, he requested to have sex with them and give them drugs in return. He’s a recovering addict, but these messages only confirmed that he was neither clean nor faithful. He left that morning, and we didn't speak for about a month. Foolishly, I let him back into my life. You can imagine it only got worse. Cheating escalated to verbal and physical attacks.

We finally ended it a week ago. I do feel free from the shackles of that relationship, but I lost my friends in the process. They knew about all he did to me and encouraged me to leave him. With them, I felt the courage to do so, but that would only last a few days before I was back with him. The last day I spoke to any of them was a week ago, the same day he and I ended things. I can’t blame them for leaving. People get tired, and I understand that we all need to protect our peace. I just feel utterly rejected and alone.

One of them contacted my sister and told her what was going on. My sister told my mom, and it's been nothing but hell since I’ve been back for summer vacation. My mother has done nothing but tear me down since. Growing up, she was incredibly verbally and physically abusive (way more than my ex was). I vividly remember one Sunday morning, getting a drink from the kitchen. She had just finished cleaning that morning, and I accidentally got bleach on the dress I was going to wear to church. She beat me senselessly, tore the dress off my body, and left me in the living room naked and scared. We still went to church that morning. 

I feel like that is part of the reason I clung to my ex because he mimicked what I was used to. I don't know where to go from here. I don’t know what to do. Right now, I’m focusing on my education, but it feels impossible. My mother threatens to stop paying for my education all the time, even though I’m doing well. She praises everything my sister does, even if it's mediocre. She never says she's proud of me; any compliment she gives me is backhanded. How will I stay mentally sane while getting the education and dream career I want?"
"I,(F18)am still living with my parents and it is slowly killing me. This might be a long one so hold your pants.

I graduated highschool in 2023 and I'm working full time, going to a trade school this september, I have my own car, I make sure my bills are paid, etc. Yet my parents argument for not letting me leave is that I am not ready. They say that my mental health is too bad and that I need to stay at home with them until I'm done school. Believe me, that is the last thing I want. Long story short, I was their golden child until I got to my senior year of HS and they started to lose respect for me, all because I started smoking weed and going out a bit late. Anyway, they had so much hope for me and even I feel that I let them down a bit because I had dropped out of Uni and started doing the stuff they didn't like. They held their standards for me too high and now I can't do anything right. All I want is the support and respect from my parents for my decision to want to move out. They still give me so many restrictions even though I am 19 at the end of this year. All I want is my own space and freedom to grow as a person and be able to adapt on my own. Yes, I do struggle with my mental health but holding me in that house, giving me a curfew of 11 on a Saturday and shaming me for smoking isn't helping me. 

I really need advice for what to do. Thanks everyone    "
"I (21 F) have been considering confronting my parents about all the things that they've done because I think that it would be cathartic. However, I'm scared, understandably so. I was wondering if anyone here has had experiences confronting their parents and how you prepared yourself/how it went. "
"
Hi ,  I am a 23 f living in my family home with my boyfriend 25m . I am writing this as I don’t know if my feelings are valid , and if so, what I need to do . But if not, how I need to look at myself. 

I’ve struggled my whole life with mental health and self esteem, however even writing that makes me feel like a prick, as I know others have it worse.

Ever since I was little, I remember being screamed and shouted at for the most simple things- dropping orange juice , not being able to get my maths right. I just remember being teased and called names :stupid, a clown , idiot, sometimes even slapped a little. Thinking back to that even now, I still feel cold and scared. 
I would be moaned at for absolutely everything! Not wanting to wear dresses, or go out , or having my shoes up to loose. I just remember being stressed all of the time. I would hide behind buildings and trees to escape them as I had no where else to go at the age of 4-10. To this day, I’m still made fun of for having doing this. 
I started developing weird fears because of the stress: I was deeply traumatised by the idea of batteries running out, or being late and the worst of all (still to this day) high ceilings.
I remember feeling very alone, and I would cry to try and get love and affection, to stop their anger , anything to make it stop for a moment !  If the crying didn’t work, I would cry louder and louder , but it always resulted in headaches and being left on the floor alone.

There was always these weird self image threats and issues . If I misbehaved, my mum would threaten to cut all of my hair off … which is kinda ducked up as it taught me that beauty is measured by hair length . Also that I had to straighten my hair for events and that I shouldn’t eat too much or I’ll get fat and ugly.

My parents would also search through my room every single moment, in every single corner. Secretly putting spyware on my phones . They would never tell me this but make suspicious comments and like jokes at topics I’d researched or messages I sent … which made me very on edge and embarrassed ! 

My dad was quite emotionally up and down also, you never knew what thing would spark what reaction or the classic “you kids took up all my time and made me fat”. But when I was little he would play with me and talk to me lots ! Which was great, he was my safe space 

Then when I hit around 11, it all got much much much worse. My dad would, self admittedly “not know how to talk to me, and completely emotionally abandon me. My mother, would be always like a hot and cold firework, I never felt comfortable around her trigger.

So, I started looking to other adult figures and role models. Absorbing their personalities and style to an unhealthy degree. Most of these role models were men, as the only female role model I had would critique herself and me in the most negative way… so why would I want to be that? ! 

So I started not eating lunch and binding my hips so that they wouldn’t grow. I didn’t want to become that. This got worse and worse and worse as the years went on , becoming more depressed and finding new ways to destroy myself. 
But I still felt this urge to HAVE TO ACT NORMAL and KEEP up my grades .
My biggest focus was art, as when I was little my mum would big me up and boast to all the other mums about how great my art was. It made me feel important, and if I wasn’t the best in the school, then I was any use , not good enough. 

As my weight dropped to 5 stone at the age of 15  , I was so so so poorly. I thought that  it would be the cry for help that my parents needed , much like my childhood crying, it need to get louder until I was heard. But it wasn’t, much like my crying it was just met with an even bigger and angrier RAGE ! My mum would hit me and call me a freak , threatening to call for me to be taken to “the mad house” … but weirdly never did call anyone. She would secretly take pictures of my body to keep on her phone, and compare photos of me then , to the previous year . She would grab me and belittle me , really psychopathically calling me too weak to fight her , and to just “let her win”, as she tried to pin me down. 
She would always tell me that “she didn’t do anything to deserve this” and “all of the other mums are talking about you and it’s embarrassing” and the constant CLASSIC “how do you think this makes me feel”

On one particular morning , I remember it being so bad , that I climbed out of my window and ran to school when she tried to lock me in. I went upstairs to the mental health room. For the first time, adults didn’t ask about my weight, they just treated me like a real human and not a possession/freak. That was the first time I felt comfortable eating in months and months. 

This continued on up until a few years ago. I was Still looking to role male models and was obsessed with the idea of having an older boyfriend to look after me and care for me. It’s all I would dream about and write about. But of course , this lead to a lot of male mental and physical abuse and being with narcissistic men. 


Basically to sum this all up, I’m moving out with my current partner into a house soon (woo) and whilst I’m still living at home, I feel fucking miserable, an anxious shell. I’m a tattoo artist now , and I can’t focus on my drawings during the day , In fear of the door swinging open and being screamed at for simple things. My dad doesn’t talk to me , he gets all weird and jittery when I’m near. My mother continues to belittle me and control everything I do, but more from just a traumatised Brain. She makes me feel ugly for every tattoo that I get , yet demands that I tattoo her whenever she feels like it. All because “she helped me get the job” .  She ruined my 21st birthday as we share a birthday and it was “her big day” …. Just everything is about how she feels !!!!!!!!!!!!.!:!!;:)£:,):£:)2£:2)):£/&:

I feel deeply on edge as uncomfortable around them both , I feel like a Shell of a human myself and I am absolutely sick and tired of it all. I’m not perfect , but fuck me im THEIR CHILD. Whenever I try to speak to her about anything that she doesn’t agree with (about herself or things that I want to do/ make me unhappy) she just shouts louder than I can calmly explain.

Should I ditch them ? When I move out should I stop contact . She already said that she wants a key and to come over lots , and to have a tracker on my phone . She also got angry when I said no . I just don’t think that I can live my own life and feel free until she’s dead or blocked honestly…  I just feel so tired and broken, like a bird in a cage 


What should I do ? 
Thank you "
"I’m 42f. My dad was verbally and emotionally abusive my whole life. He’s not actively evil or anything, I know. But he has a talent for impulsively saying the very worst thing that a person could possibly say. It’s (figuratively) almost like he has a demon inside him, just waiting to take control and make him say the one thing that will get past a person’s armor and hurt the worst. When I was growing up, his rage was an all-consuming fire. He’s said things that will haunt me until I die. He’s the voice of my inner critic, always telling me how worthless I am, even now. 

Anyway, I grew up and moved out. Dad went on medication, but it only barely keeps him from getting arrested for yelling at waitresses and such. He’s tried every dosage of everything under the sun (under medical supervision.) He knows he was a terrible husband and father. I know he recognizes he has a problem and is trying to change. But still, whenever I see him (even as an adult,) I have to walk on eggshells. Whatever his deep-down intentions, his words are still not the words of a kind man. And I have very little self confidence. 

At this point, I’m very low contact with him.  We live 15 minutes apart, but I see him maybe 3-4 times a year. Well, today my mom (they are divorced but still in contact) texted to say that Dad says he misses me and loves me. I know it’s probably true. I know he really does feel bad for what he’s done to my mom, my sister and I. But I also know that he repeatedly told me growing up that having kids was the worst thing he ever did and he would unalive himself if my mom got pregnant again. So there’s that.

So right now, I’m torn between feeling like I’m coldly taking out my bitterness on an old man who can’t help himself and feeling like I’m doing the right thing by protecting myself. I feel so guilty. Part of me wonders if I should offer to take him out to lunch to mend fences a bit. But the thought just ties my stomach in knots because I know the conversation would just devolve into him saying something terrible. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this. Maybe I’m just venting and trying to work through things. Thank you for listening.

"i'm 23 years old. i just completely cut off contact with my parents today and while i know that it is probably for the best, i feel so guilty and sad and. well, mostly just really sad. i miss the people that they could have been to me. my mom has had a really hard life. she is horrible to me and extremely manipulative, but i also feel so sad for her. i love her and i want to be able to be there for her. but that's also not my job i guess. I'M the child. 

for context, i moved out when i was 17. i haven't been on good terms with my parents probably since i was 9. i've cut off contact with them once before, a few years ago, but we reconnected after i had a medical emergency. for a while (like a month lol) i really did think things were better. that maybe they had changed and they do love me. but since then we have gotten in some really nasty arguments, especially with my dad. they have made it very clear that they hate everything i am and everything i care about and stand for. they take every opportunity to insult and belittle me. and they have both returned to their manipulative, narcissistic habits. still, i was willing to put up with it and just have sort of limited contact. 

the thing that changed recently was that they stopped doing the bare minimum to care for my continued survival. they refused to cosign my lease to ensure that i would have a place to live for the next year. i havent relied on them financially since i moved out. all i really have needed from them is to fill out the FAFSA form for student loans and to cosign my leases so i can have a place to live. i work, i have an excellent credit score, and i have never missed a rent payment, but because i dont make 3x rent landlords still require a cosigner. anyway, so they said because they dont approve of my ""lifestyle"" they wont cosign. (i found a different cosigner, so that is okay).

so, i sent them a message basically saying that they cannot really be considered parents as they dont fulfill any parental responsibilities towards me, and they clearly do not like me as a person, so there is no reason to continue having a relationship. then i blocked them. but ive been crying about it literally for hours. it really hurts. i dont know what else i could have done. i know this really hurt my mom especially. 

tl;dr
i blocked my parents, am sad and guilty about it. "
"that man can and will drink himself into an early grave, and ii don't know what to do. Not that I care, because trust me, I don't. But it is genuinely turning our household into a depressive prison.

drunk, he's thrown a chair at us leaving holes in the wall, and broken another chair purely out of anger for telling him to stop drinking. 

He breaks of alcohol, he's lost his license as many times as you can to drink driving, he's had drink related accidents, I don't know what to do. I feel as if everything on my shoulders, and I have 5 siblings and I cant just leave them so I don't know what to do. Please man"

"For some back story: my sister 32F was with her baby dad 32M for almost 10 years. He was extremely controlling and abusive to her in every way. It took her getting pregnant and having her baby (my niece) to finally have the strength to leave him because she needed to protect her baby. When she was home from the hospital, he couldn’t handle her crying as a newborn. He came into the bedroom screaming to shut the baby up. He pulled out a gun and pointed it at my newborn niece, and then to his own head. That was when my sister knew she had to get away from him.the next day she came to my family for help and we moved her out. She got a protective order against him and they had a really nasty case I. Court against each other. Cps came to interview her and I was there for support and it was the first time I had seen my sister cry in over a decade recounting to the cps what he did to her. In court, he lied so much about my sister and he got away with all of it because the law protects him as a parent too and there wasn’t enough evidence. That same cps worker high fived the dad after court that day. Years later, and multiple court hearing later as his tactic of draining our family of money, he continues to be the same person he always was. My niece is much older now, and able to vocalize his actions. She says that he grabs her arm out of no where and twists it, that he “grounds” her for “lying” about brushing her hair or showering when she says she is telling the truth- so he locks her in her room for hours. She says he tells her she is fat (she is actually very very skinny) and that her teeth are crooked and ugly- she has had many breakdowns before school because of this because he has messed up her self esteem so bad. She said he tickles her out of no where so hard that it hurts and it makes her cry. And now yesterday when she came back from her dads, she said he pushed her really hard when she was climbing into the car “because she was taking too long” and she hit the top of her head really hard. She still had a bump on her head and then woke up this morning with very blurry vision so we took her to urgent care immediately and got her checked out and a Cat scan that we are still waiting for the results for. Please any advice on what we can do. We are terrified of what he will do to punish her if we don’t succeed in getting the law to protect her after so many attempts already. If we file a police report, what will he do if he still gets regular custody? He is about to have her for 3 weeks for the start of summer. It would be too long to share how much more there is to this case, but he has gotten away with everything he has ever done. I’m so scared that he will kidnap her or punish her for telling us, or come up with another lie to take my sister to court as retaliation like he’s done before."

"I need some advice from my fellow netizens here. I’m also partly venting as my mental health has gone to the dump in light of recent events. I would like to know whether it’s a good idea to move out of my home. 

For better context: 

I stay in an Indian household and have been raised by an abusive parent. I’ve been subjected to a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my dad during my childhood. I don’t have any fond memories of good times associated with him. The abuse became emotional after I grew up and started fighting back. and hit a peak in 2018 (I was studying for my Masters Degree at the time)

I feel like I have spent a large chunk of my life just trying to undo the damage and step away from a cycle of hatred. I’ve taken help in the form of therapy. 

After a lot of work, I came to a position where I forgave him. Things seemed to be tolerable for a while. It seemed like he was changing as a person, but the truth of the matter is that he lies constantly. I’ve become slightly more confrontational over the years.

Here’s the problem -

Recently he went on an outburst bringing up everything from our past. He told me how ashamed he was of me. He also had issues with me going to therapy and helping myself. He told me that whatever I have done till now amounts to nothing. 

I don’t have a mainstream career. I’m an entrepreneur who runs a media and marketing agency. I feel like it’s struggling though we operate with a profit month on month (only barely). Unfortunately the company that funded my start up invested is connected to my dad, so we work on the same floor.

Since the pandemic I’ve chosen to stay with my family. I can survive living by myself financially (maintain my current lifestyle by saving approx 15% of my salary). Financially it makes more sense to stay at home as I save approx. 80% of my salary, and I’ve saved enough money to look after myself for the next 2 years alone. 

My confidence levels are at one of my lowest so far. I’m feeling useless and hopeless about the future. Don’t know what to do next. I fear that I’ll end up on the streets. It feels like this person is keeping my family hostage by using the fact that he is the main provider for my family. I want to look after my mom and sister as well in the future. But all family members associated with him end up miserable, unhappy and poor. If I stay back, I would be there to provide support for my mom and sister. "
"I wish they said they loved me and meant it. I wish they didn't abuse me for just existing as a disabled person. I wish they didn't treat the things I asked them to do as monumental tasks that are SUCH big inconveniences. I wish they didn't treat me like I'm stupid and can't take care of myself as if I haven't been doing that for years. On top of taking care of them. 

I wish it didn't take five minutes alone with them to turn a good day into an emotional spiral. I wish they didn't make me wish harm on them for making me feel so bad. I wish I didn't wish one of us were dead. I wish I didn't have to run away from support and a stable home in order survive because the emotional abuse is taking that much of a toll. 

I wish they gave me credit for how hard it is to exist like this as it is. I wish they acknowledged my struggling instead of acting like I'm putting more on their shoulders for just existing. I wish I didn't feel like a burden. I wish I didn't feel like killing myself. I wish I didn't feel so depressed. I wish I could talk to them about my feelings with them saying ""no you don't feel that way"" or getting defensive, or saying ""everyone's tired"". 

I wish things were different, I wish they were different. I wish they didn't make me cry so much. I wish they didn't make it hard to cry. I wish they had remorse. "
"Abusive dad? Enabling mom? 


I was suggested to post here so
Here it goes.

Myy oldest brother left home

Hi.

A long long time ago my oldest half sister left home due to my abusive dad. Things gotten better over time with him but not entirely. My next oldest sister left home and joined the military (but sides with him kinda thing so I don’t think he was the reason she left home entirely). I left home 6 years ago due to my dad. My oldest brother just recently left home in October due to my dad. That leaves my youngest brother left living with him and my mom. 

What the fuck is happening? My oldest brother says that he hoped that him leaving too will result in my dad noticing that HES been the problem. But it doesn’t seem like it. What can this say about you as a parent with 3 maybe 4 of your 5 kids leave you? How can a mom feel? (She used to watch us get in fights and beat on by him and do nothing. I was told by my oldest sister he used to abuse our mom but I was really young and remember my mom and my
Siblings and I going to a women’s shelter for a few days to get away from him) but what!!!  

I honestly can’t really wrap my head around what’s wrong with my dad? Or why my mom sits and watches? Or why this isn’t talked about amongst me and my siblings? Idk"
"My dad has always been verbally abusive. He's called me all the names under the sun. He threatens to destroy and break my things and freaks out if I move or touch things that are things for everyone to use in the house. My mum doesn't do much to help me as she's always working during the week, and I'm left at home with him as he's unemployed and has been my whole life. He's an abusive control freak and idk what to do. I suffer with extreme mental health issues and am struggling to get a job and he bully's me for not having a job when he literally doesn't have one and im trying to get one and have for a little while, having literally just finished university. I'm not sure what to do because even at my boyfriends house, his mum is a control freak psycho.
Any advice I would be greatful for, I'm not in a great place at the moment"
"for context i got my period 2 weeks after my 12th birthday and iv always had endometriosis so iv always had a pretty heavy flow. but my mom would only buy me light and regular pads so i would go thru them pretty often. about 1 pad an hour. she never really educated me about periods, just that its when a woman goes through puberty and it makes your stomach hurt and you bleed. that was it. so i didnt know to ask for thicker pads i didnt know thicker existed i just assumed shed buy me what i needed. but one day i asked for more pads bc i ran out and she got really upset with me saying shes seen all the pads in the trash and im going thru them to fast. i explained that they were full and after 1-2 hrs they wouldnt aborb anymore blood it would get on my pants and underwear and u could clearly see that they were soaked all the way thru. she just huffed at me and said they should last 7 hrs per pad and left and after a while came back with a box of tampons. for also a little more context. my mom also has very bad endometriosis but also only uses tampons NEVER pads and had always made fun of me for wearing pads.she said i needed to figure out how to use them bc shes not buying pads anymore since i was ""wasting"" them and to read the back of the box and just figure it out if i didnt wanna bleed on myself.i kept trying to use them but i was barly 12 I had an extremely thick hymen that it just wouldn't go thru and they just hurt so badly so for a while i just had to use them long ways or stuff toilet paper in my underwear. but i had a few nice friends at school that would give me pads and i found out a specific bathroom at the school I was in always had period products and so for months i just did that and never asked her again. am i wrong? was this abuse? shes always been very strange about my period and how it could never be as bad as her and im just so so lucky even tho i also hav endometriosis i just stage 1-2 ands shes stage 4. shes forced me to free bleed several times when i was young aswell."

I'm done. After the last conversation we've had I realized I'm done living on survival mode when he is home. The convo boils down to this: (me) ""it's horrible to fear my own dad, to feel anxious when you're around and feeling like I'm walking on eggshells"", (him) ""that's on you for living in the past. Don't provoque me then""


That last part showed me, finally, how little he undertsands about this, and how unwilling he is to even consider that he is damaging. I opened up when telling him what I wrote above, my throat was in a knot, it was hard to talk, tears, I tried communicating it in many ways. The fact that he responded the way he did was the last straw. Maybe before I just didn't want to acknowledge it, on a subconscious level even. But now I'm unable to avoid it. The conclusion is clear: domestic abuse. 


I'm limiting my contact with him to the bare minimum. That is, what's needed to live: stuff around the house, logistics, things involving the other family members. That's it. I'm done trying to foster a warm father son relationship. No fucking discussing the Champions League final. Yes, I've seen the match. You too? Ok. Cool. Yeah. Aha. Ok. *Goes to another room*


That and therapy. I finally understand I've been living in the shadow of fear, of fearing my own fucking dad and living in a state of survival for years. A threat in our own home. I see that I've diminished myself. Already looking for psychologists. Do you recommend a specific specialization? I'm thinking one experienced in domestic violence. I've heard great things about somatic stuff, eye movement, that kind of thing. In my view the body does ""keep the score"" and I can sometimes feel it even. 


God... So many years of wondering why can't I socialize normally, why do I feel so insecure, etc etc... All the while knowing deep down that my true self is not like that in any way.


And for anybody that might need to hear this: abusers can love too, it doesn't have to feel contradicting to cut them off from your life even when you see through their pain and know they love you, even if they've dropped everything in their lives to help you when you needed it. It doesn't make you owe ANYTHING to them. If they are true family, they will help you no matter the circumstances or the years you have been ignoring them.

"Idk if this is the right subreddit for this and I won’t go into too much detail about the abuse my mother has put me through but it’s both physical and mental though I would say mostly mental.

I have dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past to the point where I even tried to actually kill myself and I’m 18 right now and currently finishing up my exams.

I want to leave this house I genuinely can’t do this anymore I don’t know why I’m getting yelled at and literally pushed onto the floor over forgetting to fold clothes.

She has kicked me out once a few years ago over me not dusting off the shelves which then I ended up apologising and she reluctantly accepted and let me come back.

And those are a few things she has done, I really just don’t know what to do idk where to go or what to do in general idk how to get a job it’s not like they teach that shit in school I can’t even let alone find a place that’s hiring to begin with and even if I do I just need to get out of this house I don’t wanna see my mom, for the past 10 years i was hoping a car would hit her, I feel no love for her I stopped a long time ago I couldn’t care about what happens to her"
"This is my first ever post on here, but I need to vent because I can't tell anyone this because I don't want her to know.
I'm 24, and through circumstances out of my control, I'm still living at home.
My parents have never been the most emotionally supportive or open people while I was growing up, in fact, for the first time this year, they told us about how they want us to open up to them emotionally, but I don't feel comfortable doing so.
Two weeks ago l, my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me out of nowhere, and I've been a mess mentally and emotionally. This has obviously translated to me not being present emotionally, and being absent minded. Luckily I didn't have any classes that week, so I spent the whole week in my room, also trying to study (I'm in university and about to start exams) and I let it get messy. 
She eventually came into my room and started berating me about how messy my room is, and how disgusting I am. Then she called all my relatives to tell them about how ungrateful I am for not being able to do something as simple as keeping my room clean. Then later on, she asked me about why I seem so depressed, and I told her about being broken up with, and she basically told me to move on because he didn't matter  (he's a foreigner).
Then today, she asked me to get some fruit for her, and I got a naartjie, which I would normally peel, but all the trash had been taken out, so I waited till we got outside to peel it. 
I put the naartjie in the car to peel, and she just took it an ld threw it at my head without because it hadn't been peeled yet.
Then she got mad that her car hadn't been cleaned ( she's the only one who uses that car, and she didn't tell us that there are things in the car) 
And then she went on a 30 minute rant about how ungrateful I am and how I can't seem to do anything right, and how my age mates are in their own houses and how she did mule a favour by raising me and buying me nice things
I genuinely think she hates me and resents the fact that I'm still living at home. It's not like I want to, I literally don't have a choice.

"My mum and dad split around a year ago, and even though it was bad before it's getting worse. Over this time it has become apparent to me that it was always our dad taking care of us (me, my sister and my two younger brothers), and never our mum. My grandparents, on my mums side, are urging me to go to a counsellor at school, but I don't know if what she is doing is really that bad. Our youngest brother, 10, has ASD (autism). He is diagnosed, and is nonverbal. Me and my other brother, 12, are likely autistic too, but she has no intention of getting either of us diagnosed. 
What concerns my nan is that she says our mum is neglecting us medically. I told her that one of the last times I had been to a doctor was when I was 11. That was because my mother thought I had gout due to me complaining of pain very often. We went for one appointment, had a blood test, and she had never taken me back, despite getting results that it wasn't gout due to a lack of what causes it in my bloodstream. After a lot of research, I believe I have fibromyalgia, or something simular as I relate to many of its symptoms. My pain has not gotten better, and she has made no moves to help me with this. She will now laugh it off when I complain of pain, even though I'm sure she believes me. It is getting very hard to deal with, which is what made me mention it to my grandparents in the first place. My right ankle will also lock up if I walk for 20mins. What I did not mention is that I have had thoughts of ending it because I don't think I can live like this. But every time my mum laughs it off, I can't help but feel that maybe I'm overreacting? 
We talked more; me, my sister, and my nan, and my sister, who hasnt lived with us for ~6 months, mentioned other things. Since our parents seperated, it has been me, 19(sister) and 12(brother) cleaning the entire house. I will be called downstairs, no matter how much my body ached, to open the door for a cat often. While she is sitting in an armchair on her phone. She (my mum) said because we are younger we can do more. Despite her adopting all four of our cats, she will never feed them. It is always me. I will be called down to clean the kitchen, the lounge, every mess her and 10 make, I am made to clean it. She will say to her friends she only had us to do her work and make her rich, and though everyone takes it as a joke, I don't think it is. My sister moved out because she was doing this work too, and was still expected to 'pay board' to my mother.

She will ignore us if we say anything to her, and if we continue to try she will yell at us. 12 has been yelled at for telling our mother that 10's seatbelt had been unbuckled. I remember my mum threatening to throw a kitchen knife at me if I didn't shut up. She does not remember this, and when i insisted on her saying that to me, she said she probably didn't mean it anyway. I don't know why, but that really sticks with me.

I am expected to look after 10 whenever she needs me too. I likely have ASD, and to be well emotionally I need to prepare myself for it. I have received no notice before; just a text she was going for a coffee and that 10 was home. She says I can say no any time, but I have once since I was sick and she yelled at me for being so selfish. She wanted to take 12 out for a dinner somewhere. 

Even though there is food at home most of the time, she is never there for us emotionally. It doesn't effect me so much; I'm old enough to be independent, but she does not pay frequent attention to 12. I believe this is a reason for his anger issues, he can not talk out his emotions and if he attempts too he will be yelled at. As much as I wish to be, I am not mentally well enough to help him. 

I'm sorry if this is a mess. Im just typing this to try and earn the courage to talk to a counsellor. I have no clue how it works, and I'm scared of it. Does anyone have anything to help with a counselling session? "
"My mother is once again talking about killing herself, killing us, leaving the house ect. And I’m seriously considering running away. She says she loves us, she does nice things, but then when we don’t listen to her for a bit too long she decides it’s okay to leave permanent scars and make us suicidal. Should we run away?"
"I (15F) have been living with my mother 43F) and brother (11M, autistic, will be important later) for about a year. She left my dad about this time last year.

When it came to abuse my dad was normally the bad one before they split up, but over time my mother just got worse and worse.
When i knew it really got bad was when she hit me across the face for having a panic attack.

She’s proceeded to belittle, mock, threaten, purposefully upset me and hurt me since then, more than ever before.
For example, this morning, my mother came into my room to try and force me to shower. I have no issues with showering but have severe sensory issues and find it uncomfortable to shower. I had been having a particularly bad time mentally and was already experiencing severe sensory issues. She yelled at me and threatened to restrict my phone access for the day if i didn’t, then physically forced me to move forward.
I was crying, and she hates hearing me cry, so then threatened to record me having a meltdown. i don’t know what to do.

I’ve wanted to cut her off when i move out for a long time now, but i genuinely feel bad as she’s my mother.
AITA?"

"My dad used to hate me so much and would hit me and get into my face almost every day and now that I am taking about moving out and cutting him out of my life, now he is saying that he thinks that I will turn out the best compared to my siblings and tells me that I can't trust any of them and also tells me that I can't even trust my friends enough to move in with anyone. Like I feel like he is trying to be manipulative instead of hitting to get what he wants "
"The answer might be obvious to some of yall but hear me out. I, (17 Female) have had a rough childhood. Always abused and screamed at. I am convinced my mom actually hates me. a few years back, when I was 6 or 7, my step dad beat me with his belt. Multiple hits as I cried in the corner of my walls. Through the whole thing, I only yelled for my mom to help me. I knew she was nearby. My yells should have definitely reached her. After he stopped and walked away while cussing at me. I cried for 30 minutes and then went to go find her to see why she didn’t come. I couldn’t believe what I saw. She was on the couch the whole time SMILING and LAUGHING while talking to her friend. I asked her why she didn’t help me. She acted confused as if it was meant to happen to me. She then said I deserved it for being bad and to go away. I stood there with my puffy red eyes. tears dripping down and that’s when it hit me. I now knew she definitely would trade me for anything that day. As years passed by things turned worse. One thing good happened though. I got stronger from all the abuse and fought back. one thing I can’t handle is her screams. She hurts me. we fought a lot throughout the years, she always guilt trip me and acted like a victim when my step Dad gets involved. Even when she started or hurt me more, she would always say I hurt her more. One time she even drew blood on my skin with her own nails. Then laughed it off and walked away. I pretty much hate her every move. When she breathes, when she laughes, when she walks, etc. A Lot worse happened. But today I’ve had enough. My friend came over unexpected and I was so happy. We hung out and she excused herself to the restroom. the amount of shame I felt when she told me what happened in indescribable. She said she saw bloody undies On the ground. I looked at it and gagged. No one should be ashamed to have their period but this was just disgusting and shameless. I told my friend to kindly leave and that I need to speak to my mother. when I came in my moms rooms, she started yelling at me. she said “WHY WOULD YOU LET HER SEE” or “THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT”. I was so confused and asked her what she’s talking about. She said I let my friend see her Underwear and kept blaming me. I’ve had enough and told her  that  she’s unhygienic and disgusting. It sucks living with her and having to shower everyday because just the thought of her makes me feel the need to shower. I said more but I don’t wanna get into it. My step dad came home and yelled at me. Wouldn’t get out of my room. He kept getting close to me but I didn’t want to get harmed so I just told me to please get out while crying. and guess what? He still wouldn’t. I pushed him out and shut my door fast as he pounded on it. I cried out for him to go away. After an hour of my arms being sore from holding my door so that he couldn’t come in I just cried while sitting on the floor. I heard my mom laughing and telling him that he put up a great fight. I am sad. Miserable even. I have one job that doesn’t pay well along with school to pay attention to. I’m trying to graduate early and I’m almost 18 in a few months. why am I trying to graduate early you ask? Well I have this friend in another state whos dad is a college professor. He said he can get me Into my dream college fast if I come to his state. i believe him because he did it before except I had to turn it down because I had other plans in the past that didn’t involve going to college. But now i know that college is my only freedom, escape, and future. I have 896 dollars saved up So far. I need enough to buy a flight and then rent an apartment. I hate to ask anyone for help but my cashapp is $Iambm9 and every cent helps. If anyone wants updates let me know."
"I've been feeling not so great in the past couple days because of my periods, and I was making dinner with mom.

But, because the speaker from the oven is broken, it doesn't make a noise besides a short tick, so I can't hear it if I'm not in the kitchen close by.

And I was not feeling great and wanted to sit for a bit waiting for the food to cook, but I got distracted and forgot what time it was. And, I didn't hear the sound from the oven, so I eneded up burning the dinner for whole family.

And when my dad smelled the burning, he got so mad and yelled at me to go stand in my corner, and I was so tired and not feeling great, so I asked him I'm really sorry but if I can maybe push the punishment to later, but he didn't want to hear me. He was like ""No way. Go stand now, nose in the corner, and skirt up. Do I need to start counting?""

I asked him again if he can go easy on me because of the period, and because it's more embarrassing, and my mom hopped in and said ""Oh honey, it's not your fault you are on your periods. Don't be embarrassed. You should have been more careful especially we all already know that you get too hot in the head during your time of the month.""

Then she also told me to listen to my dad because I already know the consequences and didn't pay attention.

And I had to stand in the corner like that while my dad, my little brother, and mom ate dinner looking at me and making fun of me.... 

I'm sorry for venting but I don't know how to feel even a little bit better besides venting a bit.."
"hi guys, i just found this subreddit. i just had another fight with my mom and feel like i need some advice so i’ll share a bit of my story.
so growing up, my mom has always been really angry and quick to set off. she yelled and screamed a lot, stomped, slammed doors, the whole thing. she often times hit me, shoved me etc., the only thing she never did was hit me with a closed fist. i have a little sister who is only 3 years younger than me and i have always felt like my parents treated her a lot better than me. they gave her pretty much everything she wanted even if it was at my expense. they constantly took/take her side in arguments and let her get away with a lot more than i ever did. so i’ll get to what todays argument was about.
i am a full time college student and my parents are helping me out with college. i told them when i started college that when i had my car on campus i would be getting a job so that i could pay them back. i just got home for summer break and have not had the chance to look for a job yet because i wanted a week to relax without having to think of school or work. my mom this entire past week has been making snide comments about how i “still haven’t found a job” and basically been making me feel bad for wanting some time to relax, and claiming that everyone else had already found jobs. so me and my sister got in an argument and my mom thought it was best to t to address it, so she asked for my sisters side, and then she asked for mine, where i told her what happened and then she said “but is that really what happened? i know you” trying to imply that i am a liar. so i obviously got mad, and she asked “well what should we do to resolve this situation?” and i mistakenly mentioned that i was thinking about moving in with my boyfriend for the summer. this sent her into a spiral, where she told me that she was going to unsign her part in my lease for next year. she also brought up how i was apparently crazy because i threatened to call the police on her one time. then she claimed “well obviously i am just a horrible, abusive mother” which i have never said. she claims that i constantly being up what she used to do to me when i was little, and claims that none of it is true. so then i tried to fake apologize just so that we could have some normalcy, but then she told me that i have apparently been “breaking her down my entire life” and have always told her that she was “horrible parent” and always compared her to other people’s parents, when growing up she was the one who used to compare me to other people’s kids. she claimed that she was done with me “breaking her down,” and that i was apparently th abusive one. now i am left questioning if that’s really true or not, or if i’m being gaslit. i feel like i’m telling myself i’m being gaslit even though i’m not so i can not take the blame for it , but that’s something my mom tells me so i am just really not sure if any of it is real. i mean, there’s no chance i could just come out of the womb and start manipulating everyone around me, right? there has to be a reason why i ended up like this. i feel like it’s all my fault. so am i being gaslit?

"I don't know whether I should write these things down or not. I feel very hopeless and depressed. My life seems so bleak, and nothing I can do will change that. I just want to be free—free of pain, free of stress, and free of abuse. Everything that I have gone through must have meaning, because if it doesn't, then I might just end it all.

I don't know why she acts this way. I did not force her to give birth to me. She was the one who decided it. Even my own father was against me being born, not because he didn't want me, but because he knew how messed up she was. He wanted to leave, but couldn't because of me. Poor him. I pity my father so much. If I wasn't born, maybe he could have left this abusive relationship. He could have been free. But I am a selfish person, and to be honest, I am glad that he didn't leave, because if he had left, I would have probably been sold off to someone to get married. Even now, she threatens me with it, saying that she could make someone kidnap me and force me to become their wife. I'm only 18, by the way, so imagine that happening. It isn't that uncommon in my culture; in fact, most of my sisters got married that way and they never left because of honor. But they thought that this was the only way to escape the monster—from one abusive household to another. My poor sisters. I also pity them. My father is their stepfather, and although he wanted to be involved in their lives, she never let that happen. Guess why. Because she was jealous of her own children. One of my sisters even ran away from home and got married to someone much older than her because she couldn't take it anymore. Her whole life got ruined because of it. And now she does the same thing to me. She accuses me of sleeping with my own father. Since I became a teenager, my virginity has always been in question. I don't even do anything for her to suspect something like that. She even says herself that none of my peers would sleep with me, so I probably try to do it with my own blood-related father. It's sickening. I don't even want to talk about physical abuse; that's just my daily routine now. I remember being beaten with a wooden stick for 10 minutes straight because I didn't wait for her to pick me up from school. I was nine or ten. I didn't know any better. And our house is 20 minutes away, walking distance. One time, she made me bleed from my head and I had to calm her down and apologize for ""making her hurt me."" I don't know what to do anymore. My arms are full of scars, and I am ashamed of showing them. When my friends ask, I say they are gifts from my mother. Today she threw me out of the house. If it wasn't for my dad, I would have become homeless. I am just so tired. I want to end it all.

Growing up, my father was physically/ emotionally/ verbally abusive. The physical stuff was only when I was very young, it fizzled out as I grew up. But the other stuff was so brutal. The general overview was that I was the scapegoat from a very early age. My older brother had some special needs/ emotional issues so a lot of my parents' energy went to him and my younger sister was the baby of the family, the favorite, often leaving me on the outskirts. Any attention I did get was purely negative. I think as a child I harbored some resentment towards the two of them, as unfair as it is. I know as an adult it wasn't their fault and I truly feel I've moved past it. However the effects of only ever experiencing negative attention from my parents are horrible.

I was taught at such a young age that I was bad, that there was something truly, devastatingly wrong with me, and therefore I caused all of the tension and fighting in the house. My father had a hard day at work, it was my fault when he took it out on everyone. My siblings got in a fight, it was my fault for causing the bad moods. If I retaliated while being attacked (physically or verbally), it was viewed as an isolated incident, an uncalled for, uncontrollable temper. When I did mess up or misstep, it only made it worse. Everyone else was infallible, while my mistakes were ammunition, weaponized as evidence. 

I remember knowing something was wrong but not having the language for it. I was too young to understand and by the time I got older and had the capacity to communicate what was happening to me, the manipulation ran so deep that I didn’t think words like “abuse” applied to my situation. I so deeply believed that I was bad and terrible and every other horrible thing they called me that I thought it was my fault. The physical stuff had subsided, so isn’t it my fault that they yell? 

I figured out how to keep myself safe eventually. Stay out of the way. Stay in your room. Don’t make noise. Don’t cross their paths. Don’t have any wants or needs. If you overhear slamming or yelling, hold your breath, make yourself smaller, pray it subsides before they remember you’re there. It didn’t always work, but I did my best. The only way I got through was counting down the years until I finished high school and I could get out. Though sometimes that number provided more dismay than comfort. 

It wasn’t until I graduated high school that I realized what it was. My parents split up at the end of my senior year and it was the first time I heard someone else use the word. My mother. I remember when the word “abuse” passed her lips. Some part of me found it to be obvious, another part of me was destroyed. Nothing was the same after that. I had already experienced such a tumultuous upbringing and now I had to re-experience it under the lens of abuse. It was like it happened twice. 

The first year was really strange. My father was overly nice, overly welcoming, trying to forge a connection we’d never had. My mother was apologetic, trying to rebuild something that never was. My father was afraid I’d testify and my mother… I suppose she felt guilty for never stepping in. I don’t know what I felt. Confused. Angry. Hurt. I knew my parents had been strict and unkind, but downright abusive? It made sense but I didn’t want it to. 

My anxiety was really bad. With my father out of the house, all of my repressed memories started coming back to me. I was having nightmares every night. I started having panic attacks. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. Every minute awake was spent in an anxiety attack (with the occasional panic attack) and every minute asleep was filled with nightmares. This went on for about two months. I lost about 30 pounds. 

This was also during quarantine, so my family was stuck at home together. My mother and I didn’t have the kind of relationship where we could talk to one another so she assumed I was completely fine. My siblings were always welcome to come to her so she knew they were having a hard time with it, so her attention and compassion went to them. When I started having panic attacks, I talked to her, hoping for some kind of help or support. Instead I was brushed off. 

Summer/ fall of that year was when things started to deteriorate once more. My mother was angry and I was the recipient. Every word that left her mouth about me was negative, whether it was to me or to someone else. My mere presence and existence were enough to set her off. Just like as a child, it was all on me. Everyone’s anger, everyone’s moods, all of the fighting and yelling. It was all on me again. But I was angry too. I had just realized my father had abused me my entire life and that my mother had stood by while it happened. Not only that, but she was a participant my whole childhood. I know it’s not fair to blame her. If my father was like that with my siblings and I, I can only imagine what else was going on. But I was a child. She was an adult. As a woman, I have so much empathy for her. As her child, I didn’t know how to forgive her, especially when she was continuing the cycle even after my dad left. 

The year I was 19 was filled with constant anger and flights, I always had to be on guard, ready for anything. Her threatening to kick me out was nothing new, but now that I was old enough to be on my own, it felt so much more real. It also felt so unjustified. I’d yell back when I was being yelled at. I was bad about keeping up with my chores. But there wasn’t a single instance that felt worthy of throwing me aside. Yet she held shelter and stability over my head every chance she got. I was attending community college classes and working part time, saving up as much as I could in case she followed through. 

We lost our house that year, moved to an apartment. Tensions only grew worse. My mom was more stressed out than ever and I was more of a target than ever. I worked two jobs, attended classes. I was never home, never asked for anything, paid for all of my own things, never engaged with her. And yet…

I was 21 when it finally happened, after years of being threatened with it. I was a semester away from finishing my degree, still working two jobs, still staying out of the way. My older brother and I were told my mother and sister were moving at the end of the week and we were not welcome to join. The lease on our current apartment ended in two months and we were welcome to stay if we covered the bills, but after that, we were on our own. No help.

My brother was 24, two years into a full time job, tens of thousands of dollars saved away. While still obviously a horrible situation, he’d be okay. But me? I know 21 is an adult but I was still in school. Yes I worked two jobs but they were still part time, and almost all of my income was spent on school, gas, groceries, and bills. At this point, I was a few months into no contact with my father. When my mother told me this, we didn’t speak for months. We eventually got back in touch, but it's not a proper connection. 

The hardest part was that I was alone. There was no family I could stay with, no friends able to take me in, no one to help me find a place or help me understand my finances and my options. The tuition for my last semester of school was $5,000. I would be student teaching in the mornings and working all afternoon and weekends. I’d have to make enough money to fully cover all of my bills and necessities while spending 20 hours a week student teaching, completely unpaid, on top of all of my other classes. I didn’t have much in savings since I had to spend most of my income to get by, which meant I couldn’t afford a security deposit or movers or furniture or first/ last month's rent. I lived in an expensive area where even a studio was $2,000/ month minimum, and that’s before utilities and everything else. I didn’t see how I could make it work. I didn't know anyone I could room with and moving with strangers was a last resort. I spent those two months trying to figure it out, trying to accept the very real, tangible possibility of homelessness. 

Eventually, I found a place. My grandparents help me with part of my rent. I work three jobs. I had to drop out of school. I’m not in touch with my parents. I’m 22 now. Being on my own, I feel a bit better. Not having to live in constant fight or flight, not having basic necessities held over your head, not being hated and terrorized just for existing… It's so peaceful. I’m stressed about money and my future, but it feels so much more approachable now. I hate my circumstances but for the first time in my life, I have a will to keep going. 

That being said, it’s also so difficult. Seeing people my age close to their families, having a home and people to go back to, getting to graduate college supported by loved ones (financially or otherwise), only just now starting their adult lives… It's hard. A better person would be happy for them, and deep down I am, but I’m also so jealous. I don’t know if I’ll ever get to finish my degree. I don’t want to take out loans with no way to pay them back. Yes I’m working three jobs, but the cost of living is so immense, just about every cent goes to bills, rent, and necessities. I don’t see a way out but I want to find one. I don’t want my parents to get to rob me of my dreams in life when they’ve already taken so much from me. I’ll never be the person I could’ve been if I grew up with love and support, but I don’t want that to stop me. 

I know this is an impossibly long post. I just needed to vent and get things off of my chest. But if anyone reading this has any advice, I’d love to hear it. I know 22 is an adult, I know I should be more put together than this, people are in my situation so much younger and they figure it out, but I just feel so lost. I want to finish school. I don’t want to barely get by while working 3 jobs. I want a family. I don’t know what to do.

"My grandmother (60) has just accused me of being insane. This is because i broke down crying due to my father locking my phone, (my phone has parental controls even though i bought the phone.)

 
 The thing is, i was removed from my parents house yesterday, due to my mother being physically abusive and my father being sexually abusive. My grandmother has told me that my parents are good parents and love me, and that I can’t go to the court against them as it says in the 10 commandments to respect your parents (shes an extreme catholic and im agnostic due to past traumas within the church.) I tried to explain to my grandmother that my father is locking my phone as a punishment for me telling social Workers what had happened, as this is something he has done before, and that it his way of showing he has control over me.


My grandmother is now taking me to church to repent for my sins. I started crying due to the stuff my father has done and this was a full on panic attack where i was hyperventilating, and she started shouting that I didnt have a reason to cry and its all in the past. She has threatened to remove me from my school (which i had to pass an exam for as it’s one of the best schools in my country) and to put it me in the really bad school close to her.


I feel insane and i feel like im a horrible person because i know this is a lot for her to handle, but it feels like she is blaming me for everything and not parents for anything.

"I grew up in a very abusive household physically , sexually and mentally the physical and sexual  was from my father and the mental was my mother my mother enabled my father my whole life so recently I moved in with my grandmother ( who is my mother’s mom) I adore my grandmother my mother was and is very jealous of my relationship with my grandmother so I didn’t tell my mother I moved in with my grandma and recently my mom sent me a message “ hey just want to let you know I find it very shitty to find out my daughter lives in ——— from someone else” and she blocked me on facebook but no where else  And idk why her blocking me made me have these emotions I’ve never experienced before and it’s hard to deal with them. Mind you my mother “ never “ cursed and she made it a big deal when I blocked her on facebook last year. Idk I feel she trying to play some mind game with me she hasn’t called or texted her mother. I believe she is afraid to because she doesn’t know what I’ve told her mother about what she allowed to happen in that household. Idk I needed to vent.

"My mom was very abusive to me mentally, physically and emotionally and I haven’t spoken to her for months after I moved l. Today she sent me this message, should I forgive her and respond or leave it be? I personally don’t believe she has changed because she’s still abusive to my sisters. Below is the message.

“Good Morning 
It has been awhile since we last spoke and I am reaching out because as the parent I should have not given up when you didn’t continue to reach out . I do know that as my youngest Daughter  it given me pain to know that I am not in the process of you growing into a teenager and also in to womanhood and that I should and would like to be apart of that process. I would like to know no matter how hurtful it is what it is have done to you so that in hopes I can fix it or work or work on it to be better I understand you have a new life and environment with your dad and I understand and respect that but I would also like for you to acknowledge and understand and accept me as the person who gave you life and really does love you…I don’t do things right and I don’t at times have any answers but what I can know is that I love my girls and I hope that they love me and I need them and would love to always be apart of them . I hope we can make amends as to what the root of the issue is and fix it and move on with live and sincerity but if you choose not to then at least tell me why … I love you”"
"I (15f) have insomnia. It gets so bad at nights that I'd just lay in my bed, overthinking things. That usually leaves me to question lots of things, and I end up spiraling and crying.

My mother, (39f) and father (43m) have bought me medication for this. I stopped using it a while ago, due to it not working. I asked for a higher dosage, but my parents refused, saying that: ""If the house began to burn down, I wouldn't wake up intime to run"".

One night after a full day of Netball, from 8AM - 7PM, I had around two hours sleep (Note: I'm not allowed coffee or any caffeine to wake up, I'm expected to be able to jump out of bed with a lot of energy). I woke up the next morning to my father yelling at me to get up. I had dark eyebags and bloodshot eyes. I looked like the walking dead. This was on Sunday as well, so I really wanted to try and sleep a bit more.

Sundays are the days that my grandparents sometimes come over to take us to the early morning mass. My grandparents are religious, even pestering my parents to send me and my other siblings to Catholic schools, even though my parents aren't religious.

Anyway, I basically wasn't feeling okay, and I told my father this, but he ignored me, saying that I should do it ""for my grandparents"" since ""they don't have long to live, and we should make them happy while we can"". I understand this, but my mental health had already been declining with the pile of schoolwork and my friends fighting and having bad home lives.

I finally got up from my bed, and while my siblings were all dressed and ready to go, I was on the verge of tears. I kept telling him that I didn't want to go, that I was too tired, and he kept saying he didn't care. I got dressed anyway, and while I was looking for socks, he kept saying things like: ""You had all morning to get dressed"", and ""I already yelled at you to wake up and get dressed, this is your own fault"".

I was already really sick of it, and I kept talking back. Eventually, my father got fed up with this, and got as physically close as possible before yelling at me. I was terrified. It's not a nice experience to see your father right up in your face, teeth bared like a feral animal and yelling at me that this is his house and I have to listen to him while I lived there. He didn't physically hurt me, but I was scared he would.

I snapped at this and shoved him away. I told him to ""Get the fck away from me"", before staggering into my grandparents car, sobbing. My father looked as if he was going to hurt me, but my mother stopped him, saying I was only a child. I spent the rest of Mass trying not to cry, dreading when I got back.

When I did, my parents both came to the decision that I was disrespectful, and was setting a bad example for my younger siblings, who might copy what I did. My punishment? Sleeping in the laundry until my parents said, and six months doing everyone's chores (We live in a household where there are seven people, not including any visitors, and two dogs), and that I was grounded until they decided to.

Every night before I go to sleep, I have to clean the dirty laundry, which stores bags, shoes, and dirty clothes, after all the chores I had to do, and set up a bed there that I have to pack up every day when I wake up."
"im so scared of my mom that when she got in the shower i sighed in relief and was like ""good, im safe now for 10 minutes"" like wtf how do you fail that bad as a parent "
"hello, I am 18 and planning on cutting of my abusive family very soon. It has been an ongoing plan for about 4 years, but they found out about it about a year ago and most of my plans fell through. Things have come to a head here and I need to leave for my own safety and well-being. to say Im terrified is an understatement, and I am not sure what to do. I have cash saved up, as well as a job where I am putting some of my paycheck into a secret account. I also have a place to stay when I leave where I would be treated like one of their kids, but theyre not rich and I would feel terrible mooching off of their money when i stay there.

MY question is: what are the big adult things? My car, phone bill, and credit card are all under my parents name. I assumed wouldnt be able to bring my credit cards or car, but wjat about my phone? An my car, to get to work everyday? I also do not have access to my passport or social security card, I just have photos of it. I need to work out the logistics of everything before I leave.

TLDR: super financially dependent on my family, but needs to leave yesterday. What big scary adult things do I need to essentially start a new life?"
"normally, my mom is a nice person to me. but sometimes she gets really mad. just now, i was telling her i was too tired to go on a walk to a park, but she was yelling at me a lot telling me to go, and i just snapped (i've never been able to control my emotions well) so i yelled back and she slapped my arm. she also told me that we're not going on a trip again.  
other times i've been thinking about her possibly being abusive are every time she threatened to leave the house and not come back when i was way younger, and how often she threatens to send me to a mainstream school (i'm autistic and i go to an autism special school)  
it's conflicting, because she's usually lovely to me. it's just sometimes she goes too far. is she abusive, or am i overthinking it? my arm hurts, but she rarely hits me, so i'm not sure. the things she says can feel like guilt tripping, but i'm not sure at all. can someone help?"
"I hate when my parents make me stand in the corner. It makes me feel so small, and it makes me feel like a child, and it is embarrassing. 

But, whenever I slightly mess up, my dad's first response is ""Go stand in your corner. And show me how silly you are.""

So, I waited until he was in a good mood, and I walked up to him and asked ""could you maybe consider not sending me into the corner since I'm growing up? Maybe I could learn the same being sent to my room.""

Then he was like ""do you think you know better than me?"" And, I knew I messed up.

He then right away said ""Go stand in your corner and show me how silly you are."" Then I had to go there with my nose in the corner and my dress up and everything.

Then he was like ""if you are so smart and better than me, why are you standing here like a silly girl?""

Then he called for my mom and asked if I'm on my period because I'm acting irrational. Then he made me stand there for so long and I felt so little and mortified again..

Later mom came and told me ""maybe you should act better, then you wouldn't have to go to the corner. Don't talk like that to your father.""

It feels so humiliating, but I can't help myself."
"

Me (19f) have been scared of my dad since i was 8. Everytime i would do something wrong he would strip me completely naked and spank me with a belt. 
Now that im older he took the door for my room and my closet, the worst one was he tought me and my sister (15y) had been involved with a guy so he made has stand completely naked in front of a big part of our family until we admitted something we didn't do."
"I have tried to understand dynamics. If the role of the person who constantly goes up and down in moods between rejection and demanding attention, the person who can’t control their anger, who is frustrated by people expressing their own actual wants and needs if it isn’t what they want, selfish and controlling, who manipulates people with threats of suicide, calls everyone names, has been violent, will destroy your things etc. is the victim and the scapegoat then absolutely fuck that and I do not agree. 

There’s a difference between being so intensely selfish that you make everything about yourself and claim you’re actually a supreme victim vs being the scapegoat. This person thinks everyone is abusing them when no one is, and when they don’t get their way. They couldn’t give a shit about their parents, or siblings as people or as people with equally valid needs. 

They put themselves in dangerous positions so they are pursued because to them that’s love. All the while verbally abusive.

They aren’t hated by the family, not at all. Everyone is obsessed with trying to understand why they aren’t ok, why is everything we do causing this person pain? 

We leave them alone after they want space , they say that’s demented abuse, we try and talk and call and check up, they block you, asked to be left alone, try to be close and you move wrong and they’ll say how you’re a bad person and always have been sick. 

I hate this internet idea that the scapegoat is so nice and just got blamed for things. What about it the black sheep is completely erratic and abusive, unable to hold stable relationships with anyone, never had a long term relationship, and can’t even keep a job?

Then if anyone else has needs or is depressed they invalidate them completely! Whether parents or siblings. They call everyone with needs or boundaries selfish or abusive. 



Tell me what this is. Not an abused scapegoat, and abuser. 2nd child who gets attention and their way through threats and lashing out. 

I have not called the person one bad name, but if I do something innocuous that they don’t like they will send me a 1500 page text about how I’m a I’m and deserve everything bad that can happen to me, and also they won’t speak to me for a year. Tell me how that’s the poor victim of the family, the scapegoat. Everyone suffers in abusive families full stop. "
"Hey,

So I just want some unbiased feedback from people regarding if my cousins were abused growing up. They both would insist they weren't, but the older one (27F same age as me) is currently in rehab for alcohol abuse after her 3rd DUI after moving across the country to California by herself. She's made a LOT of bad decisions over the years but she used to be my best friend when we were younger... I know she's suffered from ana/bul for a long time and had a miscarriage when we were 13. She has openly had issues with her dad (my uncle) since we were teens, but has verbalized for the last few years on and off that ""nobody cares about her"" and ""her family treats her like shit""...

My younger cousin (24M) I currently live with and love to absolute pieces but he's also been through a lot. His parents kicked him out during covid at the age of 20 with no job because they were moving almost 2 hours away and wanted to live child free. I've expressed many a time how shocking this was to my cousin when he told me about it and it severely changed my overall outlook on my aunt and uncle. He couch surfed for years off and on until I was able to get him a job working with me and he was able to move in with me and my best friend. We've lived together for over a year now and things were overall happy but recently he's been dealing with a lot again. My best friend and my cousin are both queer and a messed up situation occurred on the Grindr app between the two of them, but long story short my best friend ended up coordinating a voyeur event involving my cousin.

This has caused shock waves throughout the house obviously and my cousin has every right to be extremely upset. After a lot of confusion, some things were cleared up from the extra person that was involved with this and it was proven that my best friend did not touch my cousin. This does NOT change the fact that the entire situation was effed up and orchestrated, but I do believe with intense therapy for both of them that something can be worked out...

However, I also do not believe that with all of the stuff going on with my cousin that he had any right to lash out at me in the car for explaining how I feel like our coworkers are harassing me at work. For context, my cousin is into edgelord dumb alt right style comedy and likes to make transphobic, homophobic, racist, etc jokes at work sometimes. The trade field I am in is almost all men, and I am one of two women in our whole shop. There were more before, but after the last one quit for a different job, all these jokes have just gotten SO much worse. I constantly feel like I am getting egged on for my reaction, one example was last week i was told I should ""get stung by a bee for the experience"" after talking about how my grandma was deathly allergic. This kind of things been happening almost weekly since January and I vented to my cousin in the car ride home (I give him car rides almost every work day) and he just absolutely blew up on me.

He screamed about how I need to ""Get the eff over it"", how he has to tell me like it is because when I get upset it ruins the whole vibe for him and he just wants to have fun at work. I told him that edgy jokes are fun when theyre NOT pointed directly at someone and he just wouldnt put himself into my shoes and continually told me to get thicker skin. There was a lot more that was said but long story short, he basically cannot accept that he could be wrong in this situation and even if it was all jokes, if it hurts someone its not worth making them.

I know that's how he was raised, his dad specifically gives no effs about equality, ""woke culture"", etc and they've always been VERY well off their whole lives so my cousins feel that anybody who has trauma or gets upset about ""little things"" need to suck it up because that's what their parents told them. My uncle still calls depression ""the dark place"" I do know that he's currently in therapy but I fear that the damage to his kids is too far gone. My dad (my uncle's brother) died in 2010, and my mom is a single mom whos been working at a grocery store for 41 years but can still find time to love and empathize with her child. She was also very upset to hear that my cousin was kicked out during covid and she bought him a queen size mattress to sleep on while he stayed at her house with my sister for a few months before moving in with me.

I just want to know the best way to move forward with my cousins. The older one in California I fear is a lost cause, she's been told to move back home so many times and she just wont... The cousin that I live with didn't come home last night after our blow up because I texted him setting my boundaries going forward (not allowed to use my coffee and no more rides to work) and texted back shooting off things to hit below the belt (like my weight, how I am ""rotting"" because I dont go out and see friends every night like he does, etc.) I want to be there for him because of all the things he is going through but I also need to protect my peace.

Thoughts?"
"Serious question. I feel like this void will never go away or be filled because of having absolutely no love or support from either parents. Ontop of that, growing up in a loveless, abusive household caused me to have trust issues, depression, anxiety, PTSD, lack of confidence and constantly putting myself down.

How does one cope with all of this? Does it ever go away? "
"I’m 16 and for almost my entire life my mom has been very verbally and emotionally abusive. When I was little she would frequently blame me for things I never did, calling me Insults and making me feel Iike trash. I developed severe PTSD from this and it’s safe to say my brain is permanently altered by the abuse.

My mom now is in therapy trying to get over it. She blames everything that happened to me on her depression, downgrading it, saying it wasn’t a big deal, that I’m being dramatic, that a little yelling wouldn’t scar me… is that really true?

I want to love my mom, I do! I don’t want to be rebellious or bad and say that  I I don’t love her, because I really really want to. And she’s trying her best to recover… even if she’s failing. 

She says that I can’t hate her, that I’m obligated to love her because she went through abuse too… but I just don’t know. I don’t want to be a bad kid, I just want to know I’m not being bad by saying I don’t love her.. "
"I moved back into my moms place a few months ago. I thought she’d changed, she’d been helpful and seemingly nice while I was living out of state. I felt like I’d been the issue all along, and that moving back in was best for me. I found out over these past 3 months that it truly feels like she likes to fight me on everything. I try to not talk to her and still it’s always ending in her screaming at me. She put her hands on me and excuses it, still. Honestly, I feel more worried for my cat here. She has cancer and IBD so I’m trying not to stress her out. I find her huddled up, scared.  Now I’m between going back to the city that gave me financial issues and turned me here or a city I don’t really know as well but my partner would be an hour away. The previous city has a better job and I know the vet specialist and all. The other is more unknown but still I’m closer to my partner. I just don’t know what’s right now. I thought this was.

Does anyone know if there is anything that can help him get out? Is there any government assistance that can be used? I’d really appreciate any help. "
"About 3 years ago I went to counseling for the physical and mental abuse I went through growing up until I was 18. I “graduated” counseling after about a year and the nightmares went away, the triggers happened less and less and I finally realized I deserved all the good things that were happening to me. Last October I found out I was pregnant with a little girl. I was never supposed to be able to get pregnant so she’s an absolute miracle. Unfortunately all the work we did in counseling went down the drain. Instead of being sad, I am angry. I’m holding my belly and already wondering how someone could do the things my mother put me through. I get excited thinking about having a mini me with brown curly hair and then think about how my mother would call me ugly even though everyone told me I looked like her. I get to love her the way I wish I was and thats healing in itself BUT ever since I got pregnant, my mother is now insisting on being in my life. She’s cringely hugged me twice now in one year and I think that’s more than she has in my entire life! The thought of her even holding my daughter makes me want to die. What kind of mother would I be to even allow that? I don’t know what to do. What’s the appropriate way to tell her I don’t want her near my child? She’s already badgering me about making sure I tell her when I go into labor… "
"Okay so, I don't even know where to start. This is going to be a pretty long one but please help me out. I (16F) lost my dad when I was 14 due to lung cancer. My father was an amazing dad and he was my best friend (he basically knew everything about me). Some context about my mother, I knew I wasn't her favorite out of my 2 other siblings (14F) (19M) early on in life. She's always favoured my brother over me and my sister because hes a guy and favoured my sister over me because she's the younger one (?). She made me babysit both my maternal uncles children (now 11M, 12M, 9M) and do all the household work when I was around 12, too. My father was out of state during those times. She could very well afford more than 2 maids during that time too but she just didn't. I broke my leg around the same time but she didn't take me to the doc until I called my dad crying out of pain and he sent his employee to take me to his clinic. He flew back the next day and they had a really bad fight, I've a very vivid memory of all of this but i remember my dad telling her that I'm not a toy she can keep however she wants. Actually, her behavior wasn't as evident before as I had my dad to make it up. I hope that gives you all some idea about it. 


My mother has been emotionally abusing me since dad passed away but the physical abuse started around a week and some days ago. I had my exam the next day. It was well past 12am and I was on a conference with my friends discussing about that exam only (she does not want me having friends). There was one of my guy friend on the line too. I was in the living room when I told everyone i better head to bed. As soon as I opened the door I saw her standing at the door frame in her nightsuit. She asked me who I was talking to, I said my friends. She said no you were also talking to a guy, I replied yes, it was a conference. She started beating her head with her hands and asked me why I would do this to her. It was like she was having a psychotic episode.


 I tried to calm her down but she went inside the kitchen (the living room is attached to the kitchen) and brought a knife. She tried to hold my wrist and slit it as I was trying to push her away as gently as I could in that moment of panic so I wouldn't end up hurting her. I held her hand which had the knife with mine and she started pinching it with her other. The pinches were so bad they left bruises. When that wasn't working she took the knife to my chest as an attempt to reach my throat. But ended up giving me a very bad cut around my ribs (i was only wearing a very thin undershirt). She didn't stop even when it started bleeding. When I saw the blood and finally pushed her away with all of my force she hit the wall and stared crying while holding her knees. I tried to calm her down yet again but she pushed me away and went upstairs. I went to clean up the blood and when I came back my phone wasn't there. She did give me my phone back a week later. She even banned me from going to school or my tuitions.


Now since that day she gets frustrated so easily and hits me any chance she gets. She hit me with a belt because I didn't clean up the cupboard (my sister messed it up and I had just come back from my tuitions of 4 hours). She tried to choke me because I told her I'd do the dishes after I completed studying for my tests. So it's pretty bad. I did tell my brother but he instead asked my mother if she did that (he saw the bruises and a picture of the cut too). And as you may guess my mother hit me for telling him too. I would report her but she's a good mother to both of my siblings and I don't want my sister to lose both of her parents. Yes im sure she doesn't abuse my sister or brother in any way. 


My friend who lives on the other side of the country offered to buy me tickets and I could fly to him. But honestly that would just make it all worse. My father was a well known investor and has a lot of property. And it is A LOT. I cant inherit any of it until I'm 18 obviously. He had a college fund for me too but I can't access it until I'm 18 either. (Legally I've turned 15 this year, yeah they changed my birth year for some school admission thing. So I'll be inheriting any of it 3 years later only). I have plans to study on the other side of the country and I need her to fund me. I think she's just looking for reasons to make me stay here and torture me. How do I collect the money to go study? Where I live teenagers don't really do part time, specially not girls. 


It's all too tiring honestly and I can't deal with all of this anymore. Help me out with anything atp. Please. "
"[i am posting this in place for my friend, the following words are all her own]


I (17) am planning to move out of my parents abusive household in a couple months on my 18th birthday. I have a savings account under my name, but it is connected to my father’s bank account. I do not have access to my bank card, and all forms of identification have been stripped from me. I am afraid that if I tell my father or mother that I am moving out ahead of time, they will transfer all of my savings into my dads account so I do not have access to the money. Is there anyway I could safely obtain the money out of my savings account as soon as I turn 18? As of now, I cannot physically visit the bank prior to turning 18. I am so not think I would be able to talk with the bank without it notifying my father, and I cannot call due to the fact that I secretly have a phone. "
"Look. I'm no misogynist. I believe in equality in all things in life. Be it gender, race, religion, sexual preference, etc. 

But I've been on the receiving end of a lot of abuse from women in my life. My mom, my sister, an ex girlfriend. And consciously. I'm fully aware that 3 people don't represent a whole gender and it's not cool to hold it against them. But then I get on social media and see some of the things women on there say. And all and all it's quite soul-crushing. 

I dont wanna be that type of guy and above that I don't even think it's fair. But I can't help but to Harbour some negative feelings toward women. I try to remember that a lot of men have treated me pretty poorly as well, and in general do far worse stuff. But the psychological torment I've gotten from those 3 women effects me in ways I really wish it didn't. "
"So hello everyone. I chose to join this community because I really need people to reach out with 😭 

sorry if thus makes no sense logically in the way I write, I’m kinda burnt out and just had to write a really stressful essay so my brain is completelyfried ☠️

tw: physical and mental abuse, SH, possible SA

since I was about 6-7, I moved into a new home. My mom sort of restarted herself, joining social medias and such, reaching out to friends. My dad just… is my dad. The stereotypical homophobic guy you read about. iykyk.   
since then, my mom has basically believed everything she sees. At around 7 1/2, she established a 30 minute screen time rule. If I broke it, i’d be grounded for 2 weeks. Sometimes I’d sneak into their room and use it, but was often caught.   
i grew up in a family where talking about things I liked would criminalize me. So I didn’t. I learned To not talk, to not feel in front of them. To be a perfect little kid. I grew Up hiding pretty much everything I didn’t want them to see.   
the pretty basic ‘you can talk to me’, etc was constantly on me- lovebombing, then yelling, etc etc. 

so far I have a couple undiagnosed mental issues my parents both refuse To akoknowlege- autism, adhd. I can TELL on everything I have some form of OCD. The only medical condition that is confirmed it Motor Tick. It’s annoying as hell. I’ll get into that later. 

according to my mom, and my dad but specifically my mom, I am ‘too young’ to know if I should be evaluated for any of the things I’ve preciously listed. I suffer day to day with overstimulation and panic attacks. She refuses to even take notice.   
I recently got into NJHS and she made it very clear I had to join. It wasn’t even a choice anymore. I ended up very stressed, as always. 

according to my mom, which, to her, I am nothing but a Cishet girl, I need to be ladylike. Formal, even for school, dresses and skirts only. Only because of my amazing friends and boyfriend have I managed to wear anything but. I’m very dysphoric and have pretty severe body issues. Because of this I often self harm, which is dangerous because I do competitive swim and soccer, so there is very little places to hide scars. 

a lot of my life I’ve been manipulated, forced into beliefs I don’t believe in- my entire family is Christian and look down upon anyone who isn’t. I’m the entire opposite. This causes arguments, especially when my mom checks my phone. 

on my phone my mom downloaded a parental service called bark. Parents on here, if any.

  
please, please, please please please please lPlease PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU NEVER GET THIS FOR YOUR CHILD. If you really want a tracker, use a different one, like life360 or something, only under 15-16 or so, PLEASE. Don’t. It’s ripped ALL of my privacy, all of my life. I cant talk to my only online friends- my strongest connections. My best friends. People I love like siblings. people who were more of a father to me than my own. 

winding Back to Motor Tick. For me, it used to be a repetitive clearing of my throat, but now it’s a small twitch in my upper stomach. It makes me twitch like I’m jumping at something that surprises me, but only I little. It’s only noticeable in some cases. But my mom and dad? They always notice. I do it while eatign without thinking, and suddenly I’m getting yelled at for disrespecting them. all the time. riding my bike? My bike gets taken if I twitch, wether it be from Motor Tick or not. Everything gets taken. I’ve had my HOMEWORK confiscated and then yelled at by my teachers because they don’t believe me. 

  
speaking of punishments. Some often include: pushing down stairs, not being allowed to sleep, no food until after bedtime (strictly not allowed to leave room after, not even for water.) I have to stock food in my room which is also very not allowed.

my doors aren’t allowed to be locked, not even when changing. (this is the SA part Following this) My dad sits outside the door when I shower , sometimes watching the curtain, sometimes watching ME. He sometimes, to rub it in, will make comments on my body. My weight fluctuates due to my instability in many factors, so I’m constantly dissed for my weight, wether it be under or over HIS beauty standard. His. My DAD. 



honestly why I’m saying all this is because I’ve been gaslighted enough to still want my parents around, even though I want so bad to get out of here and cut them off. And I don’t know if this is abuse or not. Help, also thanks for reading! "
"Mom wants me to forgive step dad

For some context, im 16, and my mom has severe anger issues. I had to run away to a friends house once because it got so bad, where everyday she would come home and take out her anger on me. 



We ended up “reconciling”(in reality she stopped for 2 weeks and only used emotional abuse, instead of slapping me whenever i spoke, some examples of this emotional abuse would be claiming i never help around the house, or saying it’s a “(my name) moment” when something bad happens, or claiming im always against her or saying i always do something i don’t do.


 However, 99% of the time besides those it’s just yelling at me to either shut up or nonsense about me that isn’t true. But i’ve grown accustomed to it and it actually doesn’t affect me much anymore. Now, to start the story. I was in the house cleaning with my stepdad and mom screamed at me over a stain behind the counter i didnt notice. She says a bunch of things on top of that i don’t remember because to cope i usually ignore whatever she says besides the command.

 I laughed it off a bit this time as an extra and according to my mother’s report my stepdad really didn’t like that.

 Now my mother finishes yelling at me, i finish cleaning and we go outside but right before my stepdad says to clean the stairs. im really pissed i just got yelled at so i say under my breath “dude  always telling me to do sum like he my dad” My stepdad hears this (or hears me say “fuck off” according to my mothers report later which i did not say) and says “who tf are you talking to” and starts choking me. 


i punch him and we get into a brawl(which i don’t remember much of, except for him biting my hand which my mom will not take time to the doctor for because she washed it with soap and water and put peroxide on it.) with my mom breaking us up.



 fast foward tldr because im tired of typing, i refuse to be alone with my stepdad because of this and today she’s forcing me to be alone in the house with him to clean up so she can have 1 good day that “i never let her have” She alsos saying “he’s open to forgiveness” as if he didn’t fucking attack me and i’m being selfish for giving her so much stress by complaining"
"My dad is 83 now and although I feel guilty I see him very rarely, when I make myself see him I remember why I don’t. He will fly off the handle over tiny things, he shouts, screams, throws things and insults me every time I see him and he’s always been like this (when we were younger he would hit us but he doesn’t do that anymore as ‘he knows he’s too weak and wouldn’t win’).
Today I go around to see him for the first time in months and the first thing he says is how fat and round my face is. I ask him why does this matter and he said it doesn’t. He then proceeds to say this every time he looks at me and after an hour (and after I had cleaned his home) I told him to stop calling me fat and he shouted at me telling me I’ve ’always been far too insecure over my weight’ and when I asked him why he thought this was he told me he didn’t know so I told him it was HIM. He has always told me I’m fat, stupid, lazy, useless. He’s told me all of my partners have been too good for me (even the abusive alcoholic) and has never had a good word to say about me but he was shocked that this has caused my feelings of insecurity?! Is he stupid? Or does he do it for the reaction?! He KNOWS I have a problem with my weight but he still says it and when I don’t react he says it until I do!? I’m not even actually fat? I’m a Uk size 8 but yes my face is round.
I’m so angry right now but I know in a couple of months I’ll feel guilty and go see him again and it’ll be the same outcome. Has anyone else had this cycle and how do I break it?

Tl;dr my dad calls me fat / insults me every time I see him but I feel guilty not seeing him because he’s old. What do I do?"
it’s been months since i’ve blocked my mom for talking shit about me. haven’t heard from her from my grandmother (i live with her and my mom lives in another country) so i don’t know if she knows i blocked her. it’s not like she has ever been interested into worrying about what her daughters are doing or how they’ve been. but sometimes it kinda hits me because how can you cope with the fact that your daughters don’t love you and you don’t seem to care? she just married her boyfriend so i guess there’s more important things in her life. 
"# 

I really am sick of this. My parents have been doing this since I was 6, The main thing is my dad. My father is blind and makes it his personality, he's calm at times but if your voice is tired, he snaps like ""DON'T GIVE ME THAT ADDITUDE"" or mumbles ""Oh f\*\*\*"" and If you try talking serious he just sighs and ignores me. On the other hand, we have my mother, She's been through all lot of stuff so she does have trauma I believe. Still one of the things she does is horrible, Let me play the conversation basically:

Me: "" Mom, do you think maybe you can set an appointment for me to get checked for a mental illness?

Mom: ""Oh gr-, Honey, If i can do it without all this things today, anyone can, also you never show signs of any mental illness s\*\*""

I have looked up my symptoms and secretly checked with online doctors , I have a high rating in Autism or ADHD but my parents are strict so knocking and privacy isn't real here, for example if you close the door as you use the restroom you get yelled at for probably doing weird things in there. Another example, if I bring up something that happened to my friend and stop speaking, they need to know. Most times I'll say ""No they asked me to keep it private"" while my dad and mom say ""B\*\*\*\* tell us. Is she doing drugs? Stop f\*\*\*ing being so god darn secretive!"" Yes they openly cussed around me since birth,. I'm only realizing its bad now.  
I do know that there is something wrong with me, at night for a good 15 minutes in my head I just hear laughing. Straight up laughing for 15 minutes. Each night.

I also have very weird habits, I love the sight of blood and killing just sounds fun-ish but also horrible? or something. I also stalk people for fun, its a weird addiction that kinda makes me excited, I will physically stalk and track everything about someone and randomly stop. My mom also hates that I'm ""In this phase"" I do not think I am in a phase and think I need mental help. But I guess self harm and anorexia doesn't need help in her eyes. My parents are both homophobic and are only fine with Lesbians, Bi, or Gay, Anything else n their eyes is ""mentally ill f\*\*\*ers"" If I came out as non-binary lesbian my mother and father would most likely hate me."
"Ive been thinking about this question for a while, and I think I’m wrong/overreacting cause he is sometimes nice. But he often hits us, gives me so much responsibility with my younger siblings. Often forgets me at school, leaving me to take care of me siblings. Let me give you a senario to understand.

One time, I had an after school activity at school, it was over, and I had a guitar make up lesson soon after, (as I missed one the previous week), and keep in mind, the activities at school end at around 4:45pm. I called my dad, who said, “I’m 15 minutes away, wait please.” I waited said 15 minutes. Called him again, “wait just 5 more minutes.” (FYI, my guitar lesson was at around 5:45, so we had to leave at maximum 5:15 if we wanted to make it, and that was the time. I panicked and called my mom, who said, “wait a couple minutes I’ll call him, I might have to get you a taxi.” I had never been in a taxi by myself at the time (I was 12 btw.) and was extremely socially anxious, so I hesitated. So I decided to wait. 
2 hours had past, I missed my guitar lesson, it was around 7pm, dad arrives. This has not been the first time this has happened, (but I end up going in the taxi)

Ok sorry, I’m rambling but I wanted to mention one last thing, he forgets me at my guitar lessons, doesn’t care for my events, (meaning he doesn’t care if I’m late, as it doesn’t concern him), and hits me a lot.
Is he neglectful and abusive? Or am I being ungrateful as he often spoils me at times."
"Are childhood spankings really meant to be this traumatic? 

Growing I was spanked somewhat frequently by my parents up until about age 6/7 and then it slowed down, I don’t remember much about those spankings thankfully. When I was 7, I was at grandmas house and was was spanked very hard with what I believe was to be a yardstick. She hit me 27 times as I counted. I was laying on the ground  and out of no where no warning or anything she somehow sneakily pulled my pants and underwear down without me noticing. How I don’t know and started spanking me very hard to were the bruises, blisters, and blood. The pain lasted for about a week. It hurt to sit down, I remember I had to sit on a towel that night in the bath because it hurt and the water stung, to the point of me crying in the bath that night. It was very traumatizing and even now as a adult I still regularly have ptsd from it, I wake up from nightmares dry heaving and having panic attacks over the years from it as a kid after it happened and as a adult. 
After that whenever my parents would try to spank me I was terrified and i would start shaking so bad to the point of having a seizure. From it. My last spanking was at 9 years old and thankfully after that incident spankings were infrequent and rare, I can’t even say I had a spanking at 8 and only once at 9, and no more after that. Are spankings really meant to be this bad, is it abuse or is it normal and I am just being sensitive and had a sensitive reaction to as a kid? I see all theses post about how people are happy they grew up with spankings and I just don’t get how someone can say that? "
"I am moving out of the house and my mother is abusive. I don't know what to do to help my sister before I move so she is ready. She is 11 and being an eleven year-old as any other. She doesn't like school, she avoids chores, she sneaks treats, and a few other things.   
I am used to being the one to take care of her, make sure she is doing her school work and eating well. Idk what she is going to do when I am gone. She is always told to be like me and I set a high standard since I picked up most of the slack my parents left behind them. I can't seem to help her understand that school and good grades is her ticket out of home early, that chores keep mom happy, and that hours of YouTube shorts a day is not only a poor way to spend her time but also unhealthy. I have two more weeks but it is starting to feel like not enough. I want her to have healthy things to lean to and habits to keep life comfortable like I had. I just don't want her to take years of abuse and trauma to build those things.   
Just simple stuff, like getting up early, avoiding life by focusing on school and hobbies more, and keeping things tidy.   
I would sleep til almost noon, avoid life by porn and drugs, and focus on video games and daydreams, and was a mess. It took me probably five years to switch those to the good things now. I have been trying to help her build good habits for a while now but I don't think she understands. I am worried she will have to figure it out herself but if I had been one inch off track I would be a dropout since my freshman year running away from home and getting into fights, or I may have gone through with my suicide. 

I don't want her to go through the same things I did, I want to help her skip them. But she is tired of listening to me cause I ""never"" let her eat treats and ice cream or skip chores for a day. I don't think she understands the importance of some of it.   
I am currently trying a chart I used/use to get myself out of depression, where it is a checklist starting with basic daily hygiene, going to productive things (Chores and school), and ending in-game time and fun.   
What else can I do?"
"I won't bother with much detail because I have already gone through therapy and I've been out of contact with them for years.
I was going through my drive to find my resume to make updates and happened to see  her new email address started with  ""brokenheartedmother."". I emailed and called shortly after , because as much as she was the reason I felt desperate enough to become a sex worker ( I've gotten out of that since), and she convinced me my worth was so little that I stayed in another very abuse relationship for 7 years without reaching out, she was also the one that saved me from the same feeling when I was a pre- teen ( sort of- she did physically but I was then separated from the family for a year and was diagnosed Mood NOS in an american psych ward). I still feel really bad, I have to go to bed soon and I wouldn't want her to hurt herself and the email name is a huge red flag- I'm assuming the worst. I have no idea what is going on with her and I'm scared. She doesn't live in town, I don't  have a car or her address.I'm trying to journal it out but I need some feedback/advice... I'm going to try to get more therapy tomorrow. This is so confusing- if anyone else has been through this sort of thing... tell me what you did!"
"Neither option is good but which one do you think would be worse or is worse to deal with?

Parents who physically hit their kids, OR parents who are emotionally/verbally abusive towards their kids? "
"Hi, this is my second post here. I'm asking for advice this time because I'm really at a loss.

I'm an adult who had to move back in with my abusive parents after being out on my own for a significant period of time. It's been such a degrading experience that I sometimes wonder if I would've been better off just being homeless. 

I've been working a lot on trying to set boundaries in general. I essentially had zero autonomy as a child/teen and because of this I became a people pleaser who let everyone walk all over me like a doormat. I'm done being that way. It's fucking exhausting.

The thing is, it's nigh impossible to set even simple boundaries with my parents. They still treat me like a child/teen (if you read my last post it was about how they still try to ground me and take my things away when I pay the bill for it, ex. my phone) and they refuse to accept that I'm an adult now.

Recently I got a new job that pays a significantly better wage than what I was making before. I'm so happy because this may finally be my chance to get back out from under their roof. The thing is, the on-boarding process has been slow. Lots of training, and then waiting for the state to approve my certificates, etc. For the past month or so my mother has been asking me five or six times a day, every single day, if I've heard anything from my job. And I'm not even exaggerating. It's the same question, five times a day, seven days a week, for the past month. It drives me up the fucking wall.

My mother, besides being extremely manipulative and sometimes physically violent, is a very nosy person and will be absolutely relentless when it comes to getting any information she wants, whether it's her business or not. It's very much a habit for her to harp on me and my sibling (who is also an adult and lives here) about anything and everything, because she claims ""nothing gets done if I'm not breathing down your neck."" It's incredibly invasive, and besides that it's not even effective. My temperament heavily aligns with symptoms of pathological demand avoidance, which means her ""reminders"" and frequent questions have the opposite effect and only serve to cause me more anxiety and resentment.

I've tried to be very firm with her. I've told her multiple times to stop asking me about my job and that I'll tell her when I hear something, so she doesn't need to ask. She always responds with threats of violence and says that it doesn't matter how many times she asks me something, if she asks me a question I am to answer it without argument or complaint, lest I want to get beaten. I know these are probably just empty threats because if she really wanted to beat me she would have already, but she's beaten me before and I know for a fact she would do it again.

Yesterday I told her again to stop asking me. That this is a non-negotiable boundary I'm standing on, and if she continues to ask me from this point forward I'm just going to ignore her. She said that I'm never allowed to ignore her for any reason and that if I do ignore her there will be consequences (again, threatening violence.)

I know this is probably such a simple and trivial thing but it honestly wouldn't matter what boundary I was trying to set. If I do anything at all that they dislike they threaten and harass me. I just don't know what to do because when I do get out of this house I'm going no-contact with both of them, and I'm terrified because I know they'd go to the ends of the earth to force me to stay in their lives. I've dealt with harassment from non-family members before and unfortunately law enforcement was not helpful about it whatsoever, so I have very little hope I'll ever be able to cut contact with them at all."
"I was somewhat abused by my parents growing up, and I think they both have anger issues and problems with lack of emotion/empathy. It's gotten better in recent years but we still argue sometimes.

However, on days like today, sometimes my dad just snaps at me out of nowhere. He yelled, saying that /I/ was being rude to him and had a bad temper. We'd been having a conversation for the past 15 minutes, and whilst I was a little frustrated having to explain something to him over and over again, I was by no means being rude.

I go up to my room, and was honestly triggered by him shouting, it brought me back to when I was a kid.

Within minutes, he comes to my door, POUTING LIKE A TODDLER and asks me what I want for dinner (as a way of apologising without actually having to admit he's in the wrong). He does this often and it pisses me off so much.

Why do you have the right to treat me like shit, then try to guilt me by acting like a child WHEN YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD.

It just make me feel so shit when he yells at me and has no empathy, because I'm alone in this world and have no one else to comfort me or show me affection."
"(Throw away account, female (20y)

So this has happened for a couple of years, especially when I was a teenager ( I give her the benefit of the doubt because I was a shit teenager) but I finally moved out at 18 and went to university. Fast forward 2 years, I had a few things happened and I was going to become homeless. During the time I was living away from my mum she kept asking and telling me to move back if everything wasn’t okay and I finally did, I had no home and I needed somewhere to live. So after her telling me time and time again to move back with her to get back on my feet, I did. 

I have only been living here for a couple of months, trying to find a job, paying rent with the money I have saved up because I can’t live here free. But since moving back I keep getting told “I never want you”, “when you move out again stay out”, “I wished I dropped you at a foster home after your dad passed away”, “you never do anything here” (I cook and clean almost everyday). I also get told about my physical appearance “jeez you have gotten big”, “you look fat in that”, “you look homeless, wear nicer clothes”. 

And I understand a mother should never say stuff like that to her children but she is my mum and I love her. But recently it’s been more bad things than good things. And I don’t know what I need to do, cause I can’t really leave I need to stay here to earn money so I can move out again. But I also can’t leave the room when she is saying shit like that to me even though I have explained to her that I need to leave the room right now can we talk about this in 10-20mins. 

And it’s also not just me that feels like this, I have three other brothers that agree. But I also believe she is worse with me because it a mother-daughter relationship and she never got along with her mum or even her sister. "
"I was in a relationship for 5 years,  3 years in  we had a daughter. My partner and I were really disconnected and had large boundaries  from both of our families for valid reasons I’ll touch on a bit later . My ex partner, 2 year old and I lived together in our own house we rented until we split up. After 5 years went by and after having a child my partner cheated on me with a 60 year old and walked away from us and the affair had gotten my ex  (daughter’s mom) involved into a cult which drove her mad.  Little to say I have full custody and my daughters  mom and hasn’t been around for 2 years now.  Needless to say, I’m 25 and I’m still building my career in life so I don’t make crazy amount of money (can’t afford daycare, rent ,and living costs a lone). This had forced me to reach out to my abusive mother  for a living arrangement (only family I have) , who struggles with a narcissistic personality and suffers from Borderline personality disorder and who had mentally abused me at a very young age .I go through a tough breakup and I lose my inner family,  , just to have to move into my controlling mothers home with my 3 year old . My mom has phases where she is a great person but also has weeks or days where she a horrible person, almost like I’m not her son and my child isn’t her granddaughter I’m sure this falls into having BPD.  I’m struggling mentally and I know my child needs me mentally present. I’ve tried having serious convos with my mom about my mental health and our relationship/ possibly having counseling  to improve our relationship but she takes it as a joke/bullies and only blames me. My mom watches my 3 year old while I’m at work ( I do pay her) but she doesn’t seem very attentive to her, meaning my mom will sit on her phone while my child will self entertain. The moment I get home from work my mom kicks up her feet and she no longer helps me with anything which I can understand because she isn’t her parent and she isn’t obligated too. I work hvac construction so I’m fairly tired when I get home (in a 120°F attic most of the time). My mom doesn’t abide by any of my parenting rules , so naturally my child looks at me like I’m bad cop and even calls me mean from time to time and has grandma syndrome . I feel like I’m losing my patience way more and it’s hard to focus on my day to day life due to these  distractions . I have no idea what to do besides when my daughter turns 4 this fall get her enrolled in school and find an apartment and cut my mother off. Any suggestions?

"Uhh, are my parents abusive?? Idk if they are or not.. uh they are extremely homophobic and transphobic, my dad threatened to kick me into the basement because I told my younger sibling girls can marry girls. My mom and dad have screamed at me just because I didn't have my hair up and I've been beaten and yelled at for not smiling in pictures. I've been hit with a wooden stick thing, walker, before, because my sisters were fighting or smth. My mom yells/screams at me for little things. Just today some of my friends reported my self harming and depression to a school counselor and they called my dad, and he beat me and said ""if I hear that shit again, ***I'm*** gonna hurt you"" so tomorrow I have to pick up every stick and leaf in the backyard and I'm grounded, very grounded.. My parents aren't always mean, beating/hitting is the punishment here but they are nice sometimes. They aren't alcoholics or anything. They can be nice, they just don't seem to care about my mental health, or anything I like/wanna do. My mom said she sees an ""image"" for me in the future and me being a trans masc doesn't fit her image, as well as me liking same gender/sex. But they are nice most the time?? My dad will get grumpy/mad at everyone when he is in a bad mood which is.. daily, happens at some point in the day. I just don't know if I'd consider them abusive?? These are just some things they do any well, it seems physical punishment is normal?? Idk, I like my parents when they aren't yelling at me/in a bad mood. They can be pretty nice. I don't remember the last time I've had loving affection from them but like, I am 14 so ig it's normal, plus I have younger siblings they have to give attention to. They think about my interests and seem to care, well, my interests and likes they approve of, like drawing. My mom won't let me get a haircut cus I'll cut it too short and she won't like it :/ she said she'll take me to get highlights tho so, ig I have that.. won't get rid of my gender dysphoria but according to her it will make me feel better about it so."
"my mom has always been abusive to me. Ever since i remember existing she would hit me or scream at me for the smallest stuff. She never played with me as a kid. She was in a bad mood 24/7 so i could never even have a normal conversation with her (i got used to it quickly). She would beat me in public, and if i cried she would force me to stop. We moved to america a couple years ago and im almost 18 now. She is still very mentally abusive. But she stopped hitting me. Shes never sorry for hurting me, she never admits that shes wrong. And whenever she hurts me i start crying and screaming because i just want this nightmare to end. And whenever i start screaming she says that im disrespecting her, she mocks me when i cry, she tells me to stop crying, she threatens to send me back to the country we came from. And she knows that i love it here and that if we go back i will literally lose everything and just kill myself. But she doesnt care. She blames everything on me. She keeps saying hurtful things and expects me not to cry. I cant even tell anyone from my family because they will tell her that i talked to them about it and she will get even more mad. I just want this to end. And she keeps saying that she regrets taking me to america with her because i make her life harder. I want her to respect my feelings. I want everything to be fine. I want a normal happy family like all of my friends have. I want to be able to come home from school without being scared of whats going to happen to me. I want to run away. I cant do this anymore i know that this will never end. No matter how much she ""apologizes"". No matter how much i tell her that she hurts me. She just doesnt give a shit. Im on the verge of killing myself. The only thing thats keeping me alive is my girlfriend. But this is not helping me anymore either. "
"It’s just so sad seeing my mom like that. Like seeing an animal stuck in a trap. They don’t  understand how they got there and why they can’t get out of it.

I know she’s alone because of her actions toward pretty much every person she ever knew. I finally accepted she would never change no matter how hard I tried. I just can’t help but feel guilty because it was supposed to be my job to take care of her"
"For context, I am 15 (transmasc) and live with her. I have had problems with my mother for a while now, and my boyfriend has been saying what I'm telling him about my mom sounds like abuse. She (almost) never hits me, so it didn't cross my mind at first, but it's getting worse and I'm terrified of her to the point of panic attacks when I think about standing up to her. She had always been a loving mom in my opinion, but when I turned around 11/12, things began going downwards with our relationship. 

Recently I had wanted to go up to my room with my partner and watch a movie, she was not ok with this (which is understandable) but I had offered for my 11 y/o sister to come and watch it with us, and promised the door would remain open and no innapropriate things would happen. My mother is very against me having almost any physical contact with my boyfriend, which includes cuddling, even right in front of her with just his arm around me. My boyfriend decided to try and talk to my mother about how she treats him as if he only thinks about/wants sex from our relationship (He's on the asexual spectrum) and he felt disrespected, so mentioned that he didn't feel very respected at all, and my mother yelled at him and kicked him out, demanding respect. Afterwards, I wanted to talk to her, so we sat on opposite sides of my door and I told her how I felt about her. I told her that I just wanted love from my partner, and that not everything leads to sex and she needs to learn that. She responded by yelling at me through the door, then i told her I'm done with the conversation and asked her to leave, to which she slammed my door open and began screaming at me that I'm so disrespectful and that the world revolves around me, and how I'm selfish and I must think shes stupid for saying that I don't just want sex from my boyfriend. I was afraid she was going to hit me (she didn't) and I backed away into the wall, she continued screaming at me and cussing me out, while I slumped to the floor crying and saying I'm scared. She told me to get the fuck downstairs and that she was going to call my dad. I told her I need to be alone and she thought I was going to try and kill or hurt myself, I told her I wouldn't, and she yelled to keep my door open and that I'm so damn selfish, I got the nerve to ask her why she was like this and she just scoffed at me and mimicked the question back to me, then left.

There have been more situations very similar to this, where she did hit me (not hard, and usually just my hand or arm) and I'm beginning to think she might not be the hero of a mom I though she was. She has threatend me previously, with my comforts (music, my bf, my stuffies, ect) and has sometimes not let me eat. She goes out almost every weekend to drink and get fucked, coming home either really late, or the next day, leaving me to babysit my younger siblings ( 2, 7, and 11 y/o's), then I have to take care of her while she's hung over, I make breakfast, lunch, I bring her everything she needs while she sleeps all day. Yesterday, she had a breakdown in my arms, sobbing and sniffling, I had just been crying and she knew that but still expected comfort from me, she has a good reason to be sad, her bestfriends death was a year ago yesterday. But she's been making me take care of my sibling so often they feel like my own kids. My sister (11) feels a similar way about our mother. 

Idk if this is enough info, but please give me your opinions and advice"
"my parents always favour my younger brother they never abuse him like me if i try to defent myself in any situation my father would say dont talk back to me and beat me up this first happen when i was around 12 and still continue till this day and my mother also treat me the same while even if my brother talk back to them an say what ever
 he wants they never lay hands on him maybe its because im a girl even if i dont do the house chourse they would pull my hair and beat me up in different ways while my brother plays with his friends all day now im 18 i dont have any emotional connection with my family only bad memory im sick of it i have no one to talk to im tired of it "
"Be really careful who you marry and have as the mother of your children. Today coming back to my parents after being redundant, I've noticed how fkd up everything is with my separate parents in the same house. My dad is in bad debt (1000s) he's the only one paying for the house since my mum refuses to work and spends disability money on herself. She even got a ""service dog"" costing 1000s and he's an aggressive untrained German Shepherd that terrifies my autistic brother. He's broken 2 doors, ripped shoes, clothes and the washing line. He's destroying everything just like she did to the house and family. She's never worked put us in debt so many times and forced her way in all our lives. Only my brother celebrates mother's day with her and she just let the dog scratch him up BC he was ""excited"". I thought when I was younger theyd split, she'd leave or at least get a job but dkn Centrelink pays her and her sisters for doing jack. My aunt has never worked in her life and she's pushing 55, all of this family do it and take advantage of their hardworking ethnic husbands that provide while they sit on their a** for 15 yrs at least. 

How can someone not paying any mortgage, electricity, water, schooling...how can they stay in the house they don't pay for? And bring a destructive dog too? My dad is barely scraping by and she couldn't care less if we have no food, clothes life...and Sydney is the most expensive.

This is the reason I have never celebrated mother's Day, my dad is my only mother Alofa tama , ua lava lou malosi. "
"First of all my parents are more neglectful than abusive and I don't know if this is the correct place to ask since I don't know a lot about subreddits. My apologies if this doesn't belong here.
So, around january this year I found a kitten, it is a female and we already have a male cat with us, my parents loved the kitten and pretended there was no way to find her another household so we kept her.
The problem is, my parents are against sterilisation on animals,  also my male cat is completely emaciated since he fights with a ton of other cats for females in my town. Since I found this kitten my siblings and I have been trying to convince my parent to sterilise the female cat since we think it'll be awful for her and us to be having kittens every once in a while (It's not the first time we are in this kind of situation and what they do is wait for the kittens to be old enough to be with another family) So right now both of the cats are trying to mate.
 Is there any way I can convince my parents to sterilise at least one of the cats? I can't get in too much trouble with them since they are pretty toxic and can't discuss things properly, there was already a time my father and I had a heated argument about not mating MY dog with his coworker's dog. 
And I can't take her to the vet myself since i don't have any money. "
"my family was running errands all morning (grocery shopping, etc) and everything was “normal.” my mother and i spent the morning talking, listening to music, we even stopped and got coffee before we tackled todays list of errands. 

then, after we had finished doing everything we needed to, we began to head home. 

on the ride home i put on one of my favourite songs, rested my head against my seat, and closed by eyes for a bit (as one does when they are feeling tired). 

SUDDENLY— my mother *screamed* at me. top of her lungs red face bulging veins kind of scream. she lectured me to “WAKE UP” and that “ALL I DO IS SLEEP” — startled by her suddenly yelling at sat up and informed her that i wasn’t actually sleeping i was just chilling. 

she proceeded to yell at me - screaming inside the car about how “USELESS” i am and that i never help around the house (a complete lie considering the only way to earn my mothers love is to sweet the floor and empty the dishwasher — i was also gardening with her the day before since she asked for my help. i *always* help, and i have no problem helping.). 

i was on the verge of tears - who wouldn’t be after being called stupid, useless, lazy, and good-for-nothing when all you were doing was CHILLING ON A CAR RIDE HOME. when my voice cracked as i explained that i was confused where this was coming from she started mocking me, “wah wah wah my life is sooo hard!! im going to go cry now.” 

i was speechless. the rest of my family in the back of the car was speechless. 

she does this a lot - she’ll be so kind for a short period of time and then she’ll just SNAP. i’m exhausted and i honestly don’t know what to do. 

help? advice? a gentle hand? i’d appreciate anything really…"
" I didn't know if some furniture was being built or not so I ask my dad and he stared building it. Later he needed my help with something and I needed to help him hold something. It was too heavy and he started saying things like I'm a fucking idiot and stuff. Then he hit his head really hard and I went downstairs to talk to my mom and she was saying that he was acting like a child. Idk what to do, I'm crying in my room. He was already abusing me and possibly my mom. I have ptsd and the only person who cares can't do anything at all."
"Guess what it's mother's day on Sunday. And I have an abusive mother. Now she doesn't know it's mother's day tomorrow and I won't tell her. But I can't help but wonder why she's a mother. She physically, emotionally and mentally abuses her children and then she blames everything on them. So I don't she deserves a gift at all. I don't think anyone besides my grandma does. Every woman in my family besides my grandma is the same they all normalize abuse. So happy mother's day to the good mother's who actually love their children. And to those who abuse their kids you don't deserve shit."
"My mother has been abusing me since I was a kid. And to be honest growing up I thought that was normal. Because everyone in my family would tell me if your parents hit you it's OK. But when I turned 11 I realized my entire family was full of lies and child abusers. At this point my moms abuse has increased. And not just physical emotional and mental. She would insult me and my siblings day and night. Sometimes even for no reason. Whenever she calls me she doesn't call me by my name she calls me by an insult, multiple insults. Last night she pulled my hair just because I said “be quiet it's late don't yell”. Like I'm not disrespecting you I'm just trying to tell you to lower your voice cause people were sleeping. She always does this. I'm currently 13 years old I have been dealing with this shit for tool long. I've tried running away once but I came back because it was winter in Minnesota. I can't call cpd because I have 7 siblings and I don't want us to get separated. And I'm tried of the “just have patience this will end”. I have been waiting for so long. But no one can Dela with shit every single day. And I can't tell a relative cause they're all the same. They all normalize abuse and call it “parenting”. I just wish someone would help. I wish I had a place to stay anywhere. I wish I could runaway. Cause my mother has told me that if I left her house she would consider me dead and not existing. She told me “if you don't like this house than you can leave”. I want to leave but where would I go. I'm depressed and I'm insecure about my body, and my mom has to make it worse by calling me fat and ugly. If anyone can help on anyways please help me. I can't take this shit anymore.

"TW: Suicide

She's nice sometimes. She tells us she loves us. She puts food on the table. She buys us presents. But she also does things that leave permenant mental scars on me and my brother. I admit, we are hard to deal with, to say the least. But today my brother told me he's suicidal. He's 10. So something has snapped inside me.

Earlier this evening, my brother came home from his friend's house and asked if they could have a sleepover. My mum said no. Not nicely, she said it in a very nasty tone. Then my brother moaned out of frustration, I mean he's 10, to be expected. But suddenly my mum just broke and started hitting him, then saying she's gonna kill herself, she's gonna kill him, kick him out, disown him. She started throwing things. She said she's gonna run away. She tried, my brother held her back, she said stop touching me, get out of my sight, all while my father stood there and did nothing. I tried to calm the situation, it worked after a while. I just thought back to the times she said the same to me. They're distant memories, all I remember are a few words, but the pain of those words, even the ones I don't remember, is crystal clear. There was times she told me she'd kill herself and me, times she hit me, times she smashed things in front of me. But there was also times she hugged me, kissed me on the cheek, bought me presents. I am so conflicted, this is the strangest most painful feeling I've ever felt.

I went into my room and researched for a bit. I searched up characteristics of an abusive parent, and I was confident that she was abusive. So I brought my brother into my room and told him ""Mum is abusing you. Don't listen to all these things, don't take them to heart. When you're my age, you're gonna face some serious insecurity. And you're gonna think back to these moments and hate yourself for it. But don't make the same mistake I did, it's not your fault.""

After that my brother's friend came over to our house and said he wanted to sleep over since he's also having family issues and he wants to get away for a bit. Finally my mum accepted. I was glad my brother had someone to distract him. But I didn't, my friends definitely weren't allowed to come over. I did talk to them over text though, and they all think she's abusive.

A few minutes ago before my brother and his friend headed to bed, he asked our mother if she still loves him and she said no. I can already see him looking back on this as a teen and just drowning in self hatred. I can see him in my position.

Even after all that, as I'm typing this, thinking of all the good things she's done for us, and all the annoyance we've caused her, I'm not even sure if my feelings are valid or if I'm being dramatic. So I want your opinion. She leaves permanent mental scars on us, she's made us have suicidal thoughts, but are we just being dramatic or is this really something to be concerned about? I'm scared that it really is abuse, and if I just brush it off once again like I always do, it might end up worse next time. I really have no idea. But I know for a fact, if she is abusive, something really bad is gonna happen. I don't want to be convinced otherwise and fall into the cycle again for no reason. I want to be sure of it. Is she abusive or not? Please help me."
"Hi I came on here to ask if this was just a punishment or like physical abuse. So from when I was 4-15(my current age) my father has punished me and my sister by staying in push-up position for hours when we would act out or do something to make him mad. He would yell at us while he forced us to stay in pushup position as we cried and pleaded to stop. If we got out of push up position he would slam things against walls to make noise and scare us into doing what he wanted. I recently asked my sister what she remembers about her childhood before I was born and she mentioned how my dad used to hit her. To me this seems very possible given how often we were scared shitless that he would hit us and the form of punishment he uses. If only one of us (me or my sister) were in trouble he would punish us the same way, expect he would make us watch the other one in pain. I rember one time when I was around ten he made us do push-up position in the middle of an ace hardware store and yelled at us about embarrassing we are. 


Anyways, is this abuse or just punishment??"
"Hello, does anyone here have experience with moving out and starting uni while completely cut off from your family? Or should I just work for a year and then start?"
"Hi all. I have been talking with my therapist about this a lot recently and she suggested I reach out to a group of people who might better understand what I'm going through, so here I am. Not really looking for advice as I know what to do in these situations now, just trying to get a little frustration off my chest. Some background about me and my family to preface:

My parents have always been authoritative in their parenting style, very akin to how my grandparents raised them. They're very rarely physically abusive but beatings have never been totally out of the question, even as I've emerged into adulthood. I frequently get told ""I can still whoop your ass,"" mostly as a scare tactic, but I have no doubt they would still do so if they felt inclined. They are both extremely manipulative in many different ways, verbally and psychologically abusive. I have been guilt tripped, gaslit, threatened (and more!) all my life. I know not all narcissists are abusive by default and I don't want to paint all of them in a bad light, but I would be lying if I said narcissistic abuse isn't a real thing that I’ve been subject to my entire life. Both my parents are incredibly entitled, but especially my dad, who very much has grandiosity, a lack of empathy, and exhibits exploitive behavior, among other things.

When I was almost 21, I got a stable and well-paying job that allowed me to move out on my own. I signed a year lease on a shitty cheap apartment because I was desperate to get out from under my parents' roof. It was the best year of my life and full of so much discovery and healing. I was living paycheck-to-paycheck, and despite rent taking up more than half of my income most months I was just happy to finally be on my own.

When my year lease was up, I had to move back into my parents' house. My landlord was going to raise my rent by over $300 if I were to renew my lease, and I just couldn't afford it. I essentially had two options: move back in with my parents or be homeless. Reluctantly I chose the former, knowing it would only be temporary, and at the very least I would have my own room and a warm bed to sleep in.

Soon after I moved in with my parents, I got laid off from my job. It was a *huge* setback. I quickly found another job but it only paid about half as much. I went from making $21/hr to $12/hr.

Despite this I did not have to pay rent (sort of. my parents force me to pay them $150 a month to contribute to the mortgage payment) and was completely financially independent when it came to all my other expenses. Phone bill, car insurance, car payment, credit card, gas, food, you name it, I paid for it myself. The only thing my parents helped me out with was health insurance, because I'm chronically ill and sometimes the meds I need can be very expensive.

Despite being almost completely independent financially and having paid out of pocket myself to own the majority of my possessions, My parents still frequently threaten to take these things away if they dislike how I behave, their reasoning being that ""Your things are in my house, and I pay the mortgage, therefore your possessions actually belong to me."" which isn’t even true, since they make me contribute to the mortgage payments anyways. For instance, I got into an argument with my father last December, wherein he took away my phone, my laptop, and my car keys. I am almost 23 years old. The title of the car and the phone line are in my name and I exclusively pay for them. I had to call out of work for two days and explain to my supervisor that my dad had stolen my car keys and wouldn't give them back, so I wasn't able to drive to and from work. It was very embarrassing and humiliating to have to explain that as an adult I had essentially been *grounded*.

In hindsight, I should have called the cops as soon as it happened. I have verifiable proof that all of the things he *grounded* me from belong to me. I'm not sure why I didn't, but I know now that if something like that ever happens again, that's the action I can take. They have not taken any more of my possessions since then, but they still frequently threaten to do so. I have told them multiple times that I am an adult and they can no longer ground me as if I were a teenager, especially when I pay to have these things, but they don't care.

I've started keeping a log with dates and times of every time they threaten to take my things just in case I need it. I have a paper copy of my car's title and proof of my phone bill payments hidden away so if the time ever comes where I do need to take action against them I will have everything I need to prove my case. And I had an extra hidden set of car keys made in the event that the original ones are taken.

I don't really know what else to say other than that. I just feel stuck here, I guess. I'm so fed up with my boundaries being blatantly disrespected every single day even though I've worked so incredibly hard to be assertive about them.

If you've ever experienced anything like this and you're comfortable sharing, please let me know. I know I can't be the only one. If you made it to the end, thank you for reading this far. <3"
"Hi everybody , I’m sorry for putting this out here but need some advice.

For context I’m a 24 year old male staying with my 30 year old sister in the city as we both have jobs 

Back in our small hometown stays my mother ,father and small brother who has cerebral palsy ( can’t walk or talk but feels every emotion)

My father is a man who I would describe as a narcissist and egoistic man . He doesn’t have a job and doesn’t pay any bills , he leaches off my mother and is staying under her roof .

He’s always been like that since young , a very violent and aggressive man , it’s always his way or the highway . If nothing goes his way , he’ll end up taking out the frustration either on my mother, me or my sister . When it comes to my sick brother , he is not present at all . He would only speak to my brother maybe 5 mins a day and the rest must be done by my mother 

Since my sister and I have moved from home due to us currently working , we haven’t been in much contact with him( he only calls us if he needs money) but we speak to our mother everyday.
 

Recently my mother has been in shambles and is sick of him leaching off her ( any woman would feel that way after 30 years of marriage).

And when she brought it up , he went enter this state of complete mental distortion and keep on swearing her and beating her .. while my sick brother watches and cries.

I want to help her in anyway possible but my mum said that it would be dangerous for me to go there and take her away as he might do something to me or my sister (he has in the past).

I can’t stand to see my mother and brother in this state , it makes me sick .. I don’t know what to do ,iv asked her multiple times now and in the past “why don’t you leave him?”

She says she can’t leave him as that’s the only support she has with her own family not in the picture and me and my sister living in the city .

But I mean , is being beaten up and sworn at everyday worth this so called “support”

I’m not sure what to do , even if we call the cops , they are corrupted and would let him go since he has connections and would just make the situation even worse .

I just need some advice from anybody who has experienced this type of trauma and what to do because I’m genuinely out of hope?"
My father cheated and lied to my mother their entire marriage. He even convinced me and my siblings that she was crazy and making everything up which caused us to resent her for some time. Now that I know the truth I’m just angry. I wish I could confront him but I’m still scared of him. A lot of things from my childhood are coming back to haunt me as of lately. I messaged my old teacher who used to go out of her way to embarrass me in front of my peers the other night. I’m just angry and I don’t know what to do. I have never been to therapy because I know it will only traumatize me again. I just wish I could move on but it’s not that easy.
"I (20F) have a little sister (12F) who lives with her dad (63M) still. I moved out at 16 due to his verbal/emotional abuse and alcoholism. I’ve kept low contact with him but have tried to stay in my sister’s life by texting her regularly and having her come stay with me for a night here and there. I know narcissists never change, he is a textbook example of one and if it weren’t for her I would’ve gone no contact with him when I left. 

After I moved out, I called CPS on him and visited a domestic violence officer (RCMP) with video evidence of my dad physically abusing my sister. This asshat told me it wasn’t abuse, it was discipline. This still makes me sick to this day. CPS visited the home a couple times and after talking to my dad, closed the file. He’s very good at manipulation and lying, and instructed us kids to do the same if anyone ever asked about what happened inside the home.

I found out recently that he is still drinking regularly despite claiming for years that he’ll stop.
He had pulled my sister out of school to “homeschool” her for a couple years, before enrolling her in the outreach that I went to when I was 15. She’s still there. I’ve reached out to the teachers a couple times, requesting that they keep an eye on her and they’ve assured me she is safe when she is there but aren’t able to disclose any info. That’s fine. I would like to know what other avenues I can follow to make sure that my sister isn’t being screamed at, abused, and malnourished like I was. Shes 12 turning 13 in a couple months, but still has the skeletal lankyness of a 9 year old. I’m so worried about her. She doesn’t tell me anything about how her dad treats her but I have enough experience with him to know that she could very well be neglected and abused to some degree. 

I have considered calling a welfare check on her, but what would that really do especially with his past of manipulation. I absolutely do not want to risk having that contact with her cut off. 
Any advice helps. Thanks. "
"I live in Indiana and I have a friend who's ex boyfriend was abusive.  She is worried about when/if he gains visitation rights that he will be abusive towards the children.  Is it legal for the children to record without his knowledge, and if so what are the best ways to do so.
   The kids are 11 and 3, which the 3 yo is his bio kid, so it would 100% be that one that he has.  It's still up in the air if he would pursue rights for the other or if the other would go as well to protect the younger.   Using a phone would probably not be an option if the 3 yo were to go alone."
"long story short, i’m not being abused. my two adopted sister are being abused by my aunt. and kinda my mum. my mum knows and kinda encourages it. i have been emailing social services and i have proof. they want it. they said my auntie is lovely and they don’t see anything wrong. i have to send proof soon…. or not… i don’t HAVE to but am i a bad person if i dont…? because if i send it i will be found out and my mum isn’t the best mum in the world.. id be grounded and shunned from the family… i am 15 right now so i cant move out or anyhtitn either…

i asked to be kept anonymous and for the voice memos to be kept hidden but they told me no they aren’t doing that.. please help me asap.."
"Ii swear I'm trying to get myself killed. I'm sick of my mum so whenever she does something bad, rude, wrong or hypocritical I call her out on it. So today my sister did have a bit of an attitude discussing something with my mum and my mum had an attitude too. After they sorted it out my mum turned to my sister and was like ""do you want to apologise for your attitude."" Really rudely. My sister obviously carelessly apologised and I just sat there and was like ""well TBF you had an attitude too"" to which my mum almost shouted (she was trying to keep her cool) saying ""i did not speak to her the way she just did to me thank you!"" I thought she might hurt me... But she didn't, we good. Apparently I really wanted to die so I kept going and said ""yeh that's cos you two have different voices. Of course you're gonna sound different"" ... My sister agreed with me the entire time though 🤣

What is wrong with me? Why am I choosing death? "
"Both of my parents have mentally abused me for as long as I can remember (telling me I have mental disorders, that there are many things wrong with me, threatening me to kick me out of the house...). And my father sexually abused me when I was a child.

I have tried countless times to talk with them about how these events affect me, but they just seem to get offended, and start insulting me all over again.

  
I'm desesperate and cannot take this any longer.

  
Is there any way for me to move out of this house? Or what other options have I got?

Do I need any evidence? If so, what kind?

# I live in Spain.

  
I tried to lok for information on this country's goverment's web, but it is so very confusing, and did not find anything.

  
Thank you, from the very bottom of my heart, for reading this.

Have a great day."
This has been happening to me lately.  Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on stopping it? Thanks
"So I've struggled with depression during my teenage years, which led to my room being a bit messy as a kid. I've since learned how to clean after it was beaten into me growing up. However, I've relapsed some since getting my own place hours away and grad school and jobs have been keeping me busy.

I graduate soon, and there's a gap between the end of the ceremony and celebration dinner reservations with family and friends. My mom (the physically abusive one) has said that since my grandparents are coming, this would be a good time for everyone to ""see if my childhood lessons have held up"" in terms of keeping my apartment straight. 

I immediately said I wouldnt allow them inside, but mostly because I don't want to be in a room alone with them and that because I will admit, there is a bit of mess (I live in a studio). My mother has taken this so far as to say that she will call my apartment manager to get inside.

My father (he sa'd me until age 10 but I never spoke up about it bc I've only just begun to realize that's what was happening) has stated that if they cant go to my apartment, then I'll lose any financial help. I dont really ask them for anything except if rent hits right after taxes this year.

I'm terrified of my parents and I finally felt free having my own space that hasn't been touched by my parents or grandparents. I want to stand firm because it's my graduation but I'm scared that I'll be alone with only two friends as a support system.

Are there any tips for standing my ground that won't completely ruin things?

"So I’m 18 and my parents have been very abusive since my brother passed away in 2017. 
While that is a major part of the reason I want to leave I originally planned on saving money from my job to buy a cheap mobile home at the beginning of next year. I just found out today (on accident) that 2 months ago when my dad retired my mom also decided to retire and that we’d be moving to Illinois (from Arizona) at the end of next month. I do not want to move with them as my plans for after college revolve around staying in Arizona,(not to mention how hard switching colleges this late would be) and all my friends are here I cannot mentally handle having my whole life uprooted and moved to a town 1600 miles away with nothing to do.

My job offers housing for $200 a month since we are in the middle of nowhere’s and I want to get one of those houses but I’m not sure how to bring it up to my parents because I’m terrified of thier reaction. I don’t think they would kick me out but I’m worried about being yelled at or guilted into staying with them."
"For around 5 years now both my parents have been what I think is abusing me.   


My mum uses her severe migraines to get away with anything and everything. Like recently I started doing wordle and she used her migraines as an excuse when she texts me the word.

My dad is actually abusing me though.

I can't say how many fucking times he's said fuck my life when I ask for help and he swears at me constantly. Whenever I find a way to do something not the ordinary way but I like it more and it won't affect my dad he stands up and shouts at me aggressively to do it his way. He also conventionly need me to do something every time I want to go out. He finds the need to always be in control and often only seems happy when I'm not the one smiling after he berates me. He always says how much he loves me but never shows it. And after all this he gives a lousy apology on text and forgets it. 

I have never stood up to my parents and I'm really on my breaking point and I'm scared they'll physically hurt me if I do.

They also both find it funny when they make fun of me and make my siblings play along and make fun of eachother. They decided to fatshame me today when I'm 4.5 kg under obese. My mum hates it when I make fun of her or anyone does.

At this point I've had hundreds of suicidal thoughts and tried it countless times but always reassure myself it will get better but will it?

I don't know what to do please help

"My mom has been abusive for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories was being thrown against the wall by my hair as a toddler. She used excessive force to punish me; often times I was just exhibiting the normal developmental behavior that comes with each age group. In middle school, I had head lice for 2 years straight, and she often made me cry. I didn’t know why mom was so mean. She would use threats to kill me to keep me in line often getting into my face, pointing her finger, screaming. As a teenager, whenever I spoke out against how she treated me or did anything she didn’t like, she would hit me. It became a daily thing for her to hit me—so much, that when I drove w her as an adult, I flinched when she made a rapid movement. She once slapped my face and strangled me. My mom distorts truth and one time as a teen when she was going to attack me, I was literally begging for her not to hit me. “Please mom, don’t. Stop!” I was in a sitting position on the couch, and as she lunged at me, I pushed her off of me with my feet. I got in sever trouble with this “wait until I get your dad you little bitch.” More violence from him. To this day, she tells people I kicked her in the stomach. I’m emotional now even thinking about this. 

My mental health hasn’t been good as an adult. My closest family members never got me into treatment when I tried to kill myself as a teen and young adult. It escalated and led to some really difficult times//instability. I always sought counseling, and have even been in programs, but I actually needed acute care. No one intervened as I struggled and my mental health deteriorated to point where I was hearing voices,extremely paranoid, struggling with alcohol addiction, and was in v unsafe environments that led to more undue trauma.

The only person who did assist of any sort, was my mother. God bless.

It’s just really hard, because she was and still is emotionally abusive. I think now she knows she can’t assault me anymore, but she still yells at me, calls me names, and gaslights me daily. Any attempts at discussing this are futile and usually leads to further screams, regardless of how I approach the topic. She has said that she apologizes for how she was when I was younger, and she’s trying to be a better person; I just don’t see the work she’s doing.

Again, the only saving grace between us, is that she has helped me when I needed picking up after some pretty hard falls. Her love language is acts of service, and I know she loves me.

Thanks if you made it this far. 

Im back to living with her, and am seeking ways to get out again. It’s only been 4.5 months, but I’ve had suicidal ideations and have driven myself mad with how much I’m gaslighted. Questioning what’s real.

She wants me to go out to eat with her on Mothers Day, but I told her I’m busy. It just takes so much out of me to hang out with her, agree with her lies, and pretend that I like her. 

I’m feeling bad about this. Am curious what your thoughts are, and how you think I should proceed. Thanks!"
"If you’re being assaulted by abusive parents, don’t call the police. They likely won’t do anything. They might even take your parents side and try to admit you to a psych hospital out of nowhere. The cops are notorious for not doing anything during domestic incidents and studies have shown that many of them are also domestic abusers. They’re notorious for not reporting to Child Protective Services when they’re supposed to be mandated reporters. Call CPS. CPS is a different entity and they are in charge of investigating child abuse. I spent my entire childhood calling the cops and they did nothing. I wish I had known to call CPS instead."
"I love me mom and dad but my dad is a big sarcastic being not a human at all what must I do I can’t help such dads at all he mocks me in public regarding my mobile addiction and I can’t help it and I don’t know what to even do about this i wish I was never born in this country and all children deserve parents but all parents don’t deserve children, why did they decide to have me they would have adopted a child still I am pissed off guys !!!! 
We were in a crowded place when he mocked me by calling me a kid who lost his virginity through the phone even in a luxury hotel he mocked me I got really angry what can I do guys please help me to decide what to do please give me a suggestion what I can do in these circumstances 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"As I talked to my childhood friend and my new friend and we all three have in common that we have abusive mothers we had to cut contact with. I wondered if there was a sub for abusive parents. And so I found my way in here. 

I realized knowing this sub exists with thousands of people who has similar experiences as us, helps me feel that I'm not alone and there's a safety in that. It can't be denied or gaslighted away as easy when I'm reminded that there's others with mothers or fathers who are abusive. I think it's healing to be a part of this sub.

My mom was the last one I wanted to admit was abusive. I shared all other traumas but the part about her I kept locked away in a secret box until I was around 23. I don't know why it was so hard to admit she wasn't who I made her up to be. Maybe because it would feel like my whole childhood was a lie. A shitty hurtful lie. And I would lose my parent, the core parent figure attached to my identity. 

My whole life I tried to be the daughter that would make my mom love me and be normal to me. I assumed I needed to help her. But it was pointless. She didn't let me near her, and she hated therapists. To this day I have still never heard her say what happened to her that made her this way. All I remember is her saying ""Why should I share my secrets to anyone? That's my business"" and that was it. 

Seeing her happy, smiling, and present, was like discovering a rare new bird in the sky. 99% of my memories of her, she's mad or distant. I dreamt about her as an alive doll several times. She is alive yet not. That's my image of her. And it creeps me out to this day still.

"My dad has been contacting me lately. SAed me, physically abused my mom a lot growing up. I was naive and didn’t tell the authorities earlier and went along with how my mom handled things. My mom is now elderly, out of it mentally and checked out and she was ashamed and wanted to stay hidden about it. I see now he likes to target “down on their luck” women or women with something to lose (like their job as a nurse for instance). He enjoys making women feel bad, shaming them and asserting his sense of dominance and “winning”. 

My dad wants my naive mom’s nursing pension and made it clear he felt he deserved it having been married to her (since he feels women do this to men therefore he thinks he deserves it and he takes no blame for abusing her badly many times). and he’s trying to use my brother to get to my mom and access what he feels should have been his (since she divorced him). 

Since Mother’s Day is coming up and he knew I was going to visit I think is why he called me privately yesterday to stress me out. He made sure to insult me, belittle me, slut shame me, etc. Of course, never taking responsibility for bad things he’s done and blaming how I’m “just like my mom” whom he loathes. He hates my mom and blames her for everything in his life and takes it out on me whenever possible. 

My dad has been a predator to women for years now. He owns a home in California and rents out rooms usually to women that are struggling. Then he will manipulate them, gaslight them And try to do whatever he can to them. He also goes on dating sites and tries to find women to become his “sugar mama” in addition to using his cute sweet dog and his business to gain credibility and access to women. 

Recently, he sent me an unsolicited (obviously) nude photo in his yard casually acting like it’s a joke. He’s always been allowed to say and do whatever he pleases and use fear and shame to control others.

I randomly thought to look at his business Yelp and Google and saw he has almost all good professional (construction job) reviews. Also, I want him to be known as a predator but I don’t necessarily want to put my name on it as he will attack me and he lives close to my mother so it can be a risk.  I live about 6 hours away but I can see him just trying to get me somehow. 

Anyone have any experience with this? "
"Has anyone successfully punished them? My father SA’d me as a kid and effectively gas lit me for years. He also was physically abusive to mom, etc then had audacity to shame me, etc. 

Now that I’m way older and going through changes I see just how messed up it all is how he chose to wield his power. He lives life on easy street with money he bamboozled from my pick me male validation obsessed mother, his nice house, his bikes, his good reviews on yelp for his contractor business. 

He hardly knows anything about me because I moved far away and keep distance but today has been telling me Im “miserable like my mom” ( so she has miserable when he was abusing her? Shocker?) and I just think he doesn’t deserve his life. 

I would love to turn him in but statute of limitations and he’s an absolute lying kiss ass who would do anything to save his own ass. He is a man who takes advantage of down on their luck women and had a few female roomies to pay him in his home. One of these women he got weird with and she “attacked him” (im positive he instigated it) and he turned it around on her and played up that he was an innocent senior citizen to the police. He’s absolutely insidious with no morals.

Anyone have any experience with this? With getting people like this back? It’s also a matter of what if he in his boredom and need for drama causes me issues?"
"I(20M) have grown up with a family that was extremely strict. My dad, has always had this get off your ass and do nothing but work mentality. A few months ago I was jobless but was working for myself and I had just gotten into a relationship. My dad and I were constantly fighting because he said if I expected to live in his house I oughta work. I agree, and I did. He came home to a clean home, I kept up with the chores, I made cash on the side, yet nothing has ever been enough for him. Fucking ever. Well long story short he cost me my relationship by talking shit about me to my gf’s dad about all my little quirks and insecurities and it made them both hate me and think I was using her, leading to tension between her and I bc she couldn’t tell what was truth and lies so I lost that relationship.  Since then I’ve not really talked to him much. But I got a job that pays damn near more than he makes in a year a month ago and I have been pulling my weight and minding my own business. Well I come home this morning from my 12 hour long night shift thinking I’m gonna shower and relax and try to change my sleep pattern to get ready for days next week, so imma play some video games. Well I log on to my pc after downloading PGA 2k23 last night to play on the new tv I purchased, only to find out my dad locked out my pc from the WiFi remotely so he could “do his work” last night. AKA doing his little DIY shit or some other project he concocted bc his work is not remote. I called him and went off on him because he literally told me to download my shit at night time which is what I did and he still fucking turned it off. Like the one fucking thing I wanted to do after my stressful week was play some fucking video games and I can’t even do that. Let’s not even mention he cut my hot water bc “I use too much and he can’t take his baths”. He said and I quote “since you have no respect for me and what I do I can leave it off” FUCK YOU, selfish prick. You cost me my relationship, you cost me my childhood, you cost me any sense of being normal bc of hiding me under a rock my whole life and now that I’m finally doing the things you always bitched about wanting me to do you’re still gonna pull this shit? Why not call me and ask what my pc pin is so you can pause my steam download instead of barring me from the internet until your midlife crisis ass finally remembers to turn it back on? If you want respect from me then fucking show it yourself. Treat me like you actually wanted me rather than I’m just a fuck trophy and here to carry on your good legacy. I’m tempted to end it I’m tired of this crap. The internet thing is a drop in the bucket but it was enough to make the dam break. I thought at 20 years old being grounded was a thing of the past. I work my ass off and I leave you alone and I pull my weight. Fuck I even buy my own food at this point. I guess I’m still just an immature child who deserves nothing and has no rights to anything bc he chose to live at home with his family rather than be alone. Fuck me right."
Is it normal if ur step dad smacks ur butt as a minor ? Or unclip ur bra just for fun ? Like is this considered as abuse ? 
"I'm... having to seriously confront putting my wish to cut mine off from my life as soon as I can get away into actuality. 

I'm not sure how to feel. I know the abuse inflicted on me is real and it's hurt me deeply but since they never took me seriously, never learned, never empathized, they'll be devastated. Angry, scared, suicidal, it could wreck them. 

I tried so hard for them. I gave up half of my life just to keep everything together. 

And I love them, or somewhere in me I still wish I did. I can't feel comfort in them anymore. I can't give them my love. But somewhere I wish I still could. 

And it's so scary to think about how everything will happen. So scary to try to line it all up properly so I won't have to go homeless, and won't get abused more, won't be gaslit into feeling like a horrible person for leaving after all these years, all I ever did was stay by their side.

I need to leave. I want to burn my bridges. But I'm scared it might be a big mistake. I'm terrified of it all.

Survivors of an abusive family, please, tell me how you felt after you took the plunge? Please tell me the anxiety stops. The hyper vigilance. The guilt. Oh god, so much fucking guilt it hurts so badly. 

Please tell me it's going to be okay "
">Posting this here because I can't find my normal abusive parents subreddit, I guess I'm too messed up to remember the name. So if you see this post twice, I apologize.<

I don't know why I still try with my mom. It hurts so bad every time. I feel like I get so close to a working relationship with her, and always, every time, she does something or says something that is so cruel and unfeeling that I question why I ever tried to mend the relationship in the first place.

Take 10 minutes ago. I am in town for my grandmother's funeral. Normally I am very far from their southern American town, and I limit communication to only a few texts per week, if that. I usually stop texting when the pro-Trump conspiracies or pro-Israel rants come out. Btw, all Palestinians are basically Hamas! Did you know? Because I didn't! Lol. It's nuts. Oh and the students protesting at Columbia University (I live in NYC) they are antisemites determined to not let Jewish students get into any buildings, it's nuts(I know several people currently protesting. I'm in the protest chats on Lex. It's confirmed that about a 3rd of those protesters are members of the Jewish Student Union, fyi.)

So they're kind of nuts. I have been conditioned to look past this.

Anyways. 10 minutes ago. I put on 80’s music while I made dinner with my mom, so I could drown out some depression thoughts I've been having whilst here. I have been pretty emotionally shut down for the past 4 days of being here, so as to not let myself get hurt. I feel like a zombie. Every time I have to be around them the thoughts come back. Anyways. The 80’s music always puts my mom in a good mood and has her dancing. So I think, maybe, since she's in a good mood, maybe I can talk about setting a boundary with her.

To set up the boundary, I am a skilled singer. I have been since I was 4. And since I was 4, my parents really enjoyed “showponying” me: having me sing for their friends and strangers wherever we went. At every party. Restaurants. Gatherings. You name it. They were so proud of me, and they want to show off those voice lessons that they paid for.

Obviously, when I entered my incredibly emotional puberty era, it became all too much. I begged them to stop. I would get so embarrassed when they asked me to sing, that I would have to find a bathroom and cry and hide for hours. I would tell them I couldn't handle it right now. I was going through a lot – “friends” bullying me, horrible menses, a fun little eating disorder. “You're being selfish, we paid for those voice lessons, you better show them off!!!” That was painful to hear. It's still painful to hear till this day, because my mother will never drop it. I'm 30 now and she can't let it go.

(Btw, this is a small event out of hundreds of larger, more hurtful events. Physically hurtful events.)

So we're singing. Well, I'm fake singing and she knows it. I'm just trying to show that I am enjoying the moment so she doesn't make a comment like “if you're going to be so depressed around us then why come at all?” She starts trying some high notes, and asks me to teach her. I freeze up, that emotional PTSD hitting me in the damn face. I REALLY want to hide in the hallway bathroom. I try to work through it and “teach” her. She says “show me!” And I ignore it. No more singing from me.

We finish dinner, eat with my Dad, and all are still in a relatively good mood, thank God. My dad and I are talking while my mom is distracted, and I actually think we had a constructive conversation where I set a real (unrelated)boundary. My dad is a much better listener than my mom. So I've built up some confidence.

My mom is singing a little while playing her phone game. I am cleaning up the table, and I tell her, “You know I would love to sing with you if you weren't weird about it, I actually love to sing” (bad choice of words) 

Mom: “What! When have I ever been weird about you singing”

Me: “Do you know what showponying is?” (Btw I have defined showpony for her about once a year. To be fair it's not commonly used in this way, unless you're an improviser. The real phrase that I want to say is that she “pimps me out” but she would be very distracted by the use of the ‘curse word’, “pimp”.)

Mom: “No, did you make that word up?” 

Me: “Well it's when you ask someone to do something, like sing, for others, just for your own enjoyment, without caring whether the singer wants to or not”

Mom: “oh my GOSH, STOP!! WHEN have I ever done that to you!!!!”

Me: “Yesterday (at a family gathering), the day before(a different but similar family gathering), and also the day before that(when I was trying to practice privately for a song I was singing at my grandmother's funeral). I really don't like it and it hurts my feelings. If you promised to stop I would sing with you whenever you want! I'd be happy to”

Mom: (shuts down at this suggestion) “I do not do that to you ever. Of course you can turn any conversation negative. I'm done talking, leave me alone so I can play my game. I'm tired and I don't want to deal with that nonsense right now”

I want to push back so bad. I know it's hopeless.

Me: “Well, I'm just trying to set a boundary with you so we can have a better relationship…”

Mom: “Just stop. I can't handle your negativity.”

Me: “well I'm sorry, but actually you were the one who made it negative, I was just trying to solve a problem...”

She walks away. 

I'm so messed up now. I'm a 30 year old grown ass woman and I am on the floor of our hallway bathroom just bawling my eyes out. Why do I try?? Why do I think things will change???? 

Because I have hope that I can one day have a relationship with them. I'm so jealous of my best friend, who tells her mom everything. I just wish I had that. 

It's stupid and I know I have to stop, but I also know that I'm addicted to trying at this point. Is anyone else here still trying? Can anyone relate? Or is it just too foolish.

"(Trigger warning)

My mother and father are very abusive in every way and social services are now involved but i want to see if this was abuse or not before i tell my social worker. 

When i was younger my father used to shower me. Now this may have been normal if your daughter was between 4-8 but it only stopped when i was 11-12. My friend said thats already a red flag. My memories of this are really fuzzy but i remember he used to take a really long time cleaning and drying between those “certain parts.” However, apparently i kept wanting him to wash me and dry me. I believe that to be somewhat true. However, my father all that time said he was so disappointed in me growing up and how he’ll miss his time doing this with me once i grow older and how it’s not ever going to be the same with me “leaving” him, and i didnt want him to not “love” me anymore, so i kept allowing him to do it and kept asking was he going to want to give me a “shower”

My father has in the past climbed into bed with me while im asleep to try to “cuddle” with me, and has grabbed my breasts and has also tried to kiss me, so he has a history of doing things he shouldn’t.

Basically, is this my fault or was i being assaulted by my father?

"I needed to vent. 

Mum didn’t make breakfast for me in the mornings n I used to faint at school. She’d let me go to school with eye boogers. My classmates had to tell me I need to remove them in the mornings. She gave me money to buy fried food at the cafeteria sometimes. My grandfather scolded my parents to take better care of me and due to societal pressure she encouraged me to eat more junk food so that I’d stop being skinny. After I hit puberty she’d make me feel bad if I was starting to gain weight.

I’m still struggling.. I keep thinking I won’t get to get that good I liked ever again as it’ll be taken away from me and someone will restrict me. I’m feeling so messed up. "
"I’m helping a family member try to sort through some memories of abuse from when they were a child. Some of their memories took place at Wayfarers Chapel likely around the late 50s early 60s in Palos Verdes. I’m wondering if anyone else from the area knows anyone that might have suffered abuse there, even if it’s a rumor?"
"So When I (F,25) turned 15 I became pretty depressed. I've never really known why as up to that point my life was pretty smooth sailing, nothing traumatic. My parents split up a few years before and dad moved out but  they continued to talk and coparent.

Anyway at 15 I was depressed. I didn't want to get up out of bed. Couldn't face going to school and honestly just wanted the world to stop but at that age I couldn't verbalise it.

I guess my parents didn't understand and just thought I was being lazy. The first few months it was just my mum. there was a lot of shouting at me to get up and threats of taking things away (like toys/objects that I loved ect)  if i didnt get to school. Telling me that she was disappointed. That would I do reflects badly on my siblings and on her. 

Then it turned physical first just dragging me out of bed (I had a cabin bed so I got pulled down from that and it would leave marks from when I would hit my back on the steps) then came the hitting. My mum would scream and I would just completely shut down and because I couldn't answer (I guess she thought I just wasn't answering her on purpose) the hits came. A few slaps on the cheek. A few hits to the arms. Then she would throw things at me, pretty much anything she had in reach in my bedroom, shoes, Action figures.

I was already struggling with school before all this and then as this was happening my grades slipped more (be that from the depression or the screaming and hitting)

I got pulled in to the head of years office and asked if everything was OK at home and it was like I knew I could say ""no my mums been hitting me"" yet I couldn't say that. All I could say was yeah everything's fine. Because I knew if I said anything the school would have to look into it and they could not just take me away but my siblings and they didn't deserve to lose thier mum because of me

My dad then moved back in. Told me it was because my mum didn't know how to handle me anymore. That she was struggling to handle me and look after my siblings

I actually thought that maybe I wouldn't spend every morning being screamed at and hit when he moved back in. But I was wrong about 1 of those. My dad never hit but the shouting didn't stop. He pinned me against the wall one time and told me if I didn't start behaving and doing what I was asked then I could pack my bags and leave.

When I finally left school and got a job and paid money towards the household it all just stopped. The shouting, the hitting.

I guess in my head I rationalised it to I made them angry with all my defiance and it wasn't their fault they didn't know I was depressed.

Then my younger sister started doing the same thing. Sleeping in, refusing to get up and go to school and I thought oh god they're going to shout and hit her too but they didn't. They never raised their voice once, never once raised a finger towards her. She was met with compassion and understanding.

I remember asking once why they shouted at me but not her and got scoffed at and told you were trying to wind us up and your sister is ill.

Im 25 now. My older sibling was talking about when we were school the other day and was like ""remember when mum used to have to drag you out of bed. God she would scream"" laughing. My parents were there too laughing saying ""those were the days"" and I just sat there thinking am I crazy. Am I the only one that remembers everything that happened.

The thing is in my head I know it was abuse of some kind, be it physical, emotional.
Yet they've never done it since, they don't talk about, never apologised for it. Its like everyone moved on and it was just a blip.

I can't talk to my siblings about any of it because i know they won't understand. I was the only one that went through it. Its like we didn't have the same parents. 
I don't really know if I can bring it up with my parents. Call it abuse to their face.

Anyway just needed a space to get it off my chest as it's been running through my head the last couple of days."
"I have been suffering by the hands of my parents since I was a child, I am 25 now and it is still happening to this day...

No matter how much I point it out to them, they still can't see it! They keep throwing bitch-fits and I am honestly so heartbroken because of all this. They are the ones that are supposed to understand me the most, right?

I don't have any friends or a partner and I feel so alone in all of this, it is just me against the world 😭

I feel like nothing."
"How is it possible I didn't figure out they were emotionally abusive until I turned 40?! I knew I dealt with extreme parentification, but explained it by ""we didn't know it was wrong then"". But she's still being toxic and manipulative to this day, and is so intertwined in my life that I have no idea how to cut her off. 

I'm usually so self aware, but this hit me out of nowhere.

Does anyone know what I need to look for in a therapist or life coach? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple of days and want to go in prepared. (ADHD, unrelated to this)"

hi. this is my first time posting a reddit so no clue what i’m doing. i’m 23 M and my father is really abusive. i’m away at medical school but that is due to finish in two months, the plan is to move home but i’m having second thoughts about it. 

my father has been violent towards my mother and both my sisters. he was been violent towards me, put me in A&E during my sixth form days, emotionally manipulative, blackmails etc you name it he does it. my mum wouldn’t have a divorce because im from a traditional indian family. 

i decided to make a post today because im at home for the weekend and my dad attempted to kick me out the house, so i was gonna just drive back to university. but then he took my car keys and then now i can’t leave, this all happened at 2am. I’m really exhausted from the years of abuse, and the thought of being home permanently scares me. 

my older sister felt the same and she recently moved out and moved abroad to get away from all the abuse. my other sister who is older stays at home, and her health and mental health deteriorates. my mother has been depressed since the day i have met her. she has no hobbies, no friends, doesn’t go out she is just broken inside and out. I’ve spent years trying to help my mum but it leads no where. 

i’m at the point now where i can’t sleep for months, PTSD, cry out of no where, get triggered all the time, i shake when he is near me, my body shakes a lot more when he touches me. my mother always told me when i was a kid, like 6/7, that when i get older he will get better…. he hasn’t. it’s just gotten a lot worse. I thought when i would be older and a graduate, blooooody medical school, he would be better. but he isn’t…… 

I know I should move out but the reason i don’t want to is because of money. i won’t be able to save & i grew up poor. the thought of spending money on rent scares me. but then maybe i should because of the mental health benefits?  

Just want to know people’s thoughts about my situation. "
"I thought it was gross, and I didn’t want to do it. Is this abuse? "

and then the abusive parents will laugh about it little cunts
so basically the cunt aka my 'mom' is inviting me to a lunch after school to celebrate the end of school saying stupid shit like oh its our first childs exams .theyre crazy if they think im going to go
my childhood abuse scars will fireveer be on me im so sad its like permanent even when shes dead theyll still be there
it was actuallly sick just because i was rebelling to her littke taunts
i remember when my abusive parents used to beat me full on naked in the bathroom and they would like block the doors so i cant escape so i would be cornered in lmao it just came to my head it makes me so sad
"Growing up in a family where physical abuse is normal and ""keeping womens under the men's feet is common"" and they justify this attitude as religious. Now I'm 20 years old and I've to hear a lots of stuff such as I'm worthless, no one needs a daughter luke me, why I don't commit su***de like others and some times physical abuse. After all this I still tried to be a good daughter to my parents but that never happened my sister who is 10 years younger than me she is always the best and if she make a mistake that's my fault cause as an elder sister I never taught her I stopped talking to my younger sister but still it's my fault. To my mom my cousin are best as daugter and I'm a failure.
Is there any problem with me. To avoid those situations I almost locked my self in the room and now I'm thinking I should commit su**de."

"My close friend (in high school, under 18m, let's call him Christopher) has been abused by his stepdad. Ever since his mother has been married to him(let's call him Tony) it has been hell for my friend, his sister(in same high school), and other siblings. Christopher has told me about how many chores he has to do everyday, and he doesn't even have a phone, which I found a little crazy. He has to do outdoor chores in the morning before school, has to wash dishes after-school, clean, do a little cooking, do his homework, take out the trash, and through it all he's constantly yelled at and gets very little time to play. I just thought his parents just seemed to give out more chores than normal but a couple months ago it got worse. Tony demanded that at the end of each month, Christopher must pay him $20. Tony calls it “rent.” Christopher isn't like me, where I get an allowance, thus his only form of income is gifts, birthday, and Christmas. He needed to do some odd jobs, like using his brain(he’s in top 10 btw) to do people's homework for money and he has been able to scrape by with help from me and his other friends. It got worse as now when he cleans around the house he finds things labeled “king” which means it is Tony's stuff. I fear it is going to get worse and worse by the day, making him do more things than a high school student can possibly do. His sister is grounded for a very long time, not being able to leave the house, no phone, and not having many things teens have nowadays because she actually sued her parents but failed in court. I help Christopher and follow the things I have been told to do, such as telling him I'm with him no matter what and giving him money. This has gone too far and I wonder what is the next step in helping my friend?"
"cuz like i get calling ur kid a bitch unwarranted is bad but if i am being a bitch, or worthless or a disgrace and i know my mom will call me those things then at that point its on me right? i lowkey deserve it at that point. also is it abuse to say ""you deserve to be beat"" if she said it only once? or when i expressed suicidal thoughts once she told me to get on with it? other than these things my mom is fine considering the pain she herself goes through with scoliosis. like maybe im a bad daughter? she always tells me i dont do anything around the house and i tell her to give me a list of chores because she never has, and she tells me to offer to do chores but when i do she says no.but then she says i never offer? sorry im rambling now my point is, is she abusive at all? or is it my fault? "
my dads birthday was this wednesday and I gave him a candle my mom bought for me and a store bought card. (im 13 i dont have any money rn) he is yelling at me and is saying i suck at everything and makes his life worse
"im honestly shocked. so my mom and dad have been arguing again - nothing new. they used to be a lot worse and i would ALWAYS involve myself, i would always try to come to the rescue for my mom and she would always tell me not to involve myself. i used to absolutely hate my dad and my mom would tell me ""he is still your dad"" - i would basically fight my moms battles and for years i have always tried to be the ""peacemaker"" or the ""mediator"" - i am also the eldest by the way .. however i realized it was truly never my battle to fight. i am just their child and they are the adults who should know better. 

so, recently my mom has developed a pattern. whenever her and my dad are on bad terms, suddenly my siblings and i are the worst people on earth too. 

she randomly started talking about how she is treated so badly and that others (being me and my siblings?) see and do nothing ... she said ""and they are just as guilty, you are actually an accomplice"" ... ??? i was so shocked ... how can you call your child an accomplice in something they have no control over .. and also keeping in mind that she was the SAME person who said we shouldnt pick sides and that my dad is still my dad .. it seems that she doesnt like my relationship with my dad - she always tries to make me feel guilty over things that have nothing to do with me/i have no control over.

"I’m 52 and all my life my mother and step dad have been so nasty, to the point of abuse. I haven’t spoken to them for 7 years because they have now disowned me because I left my car on their driveway for 1 week. I have just moved back to my hometown for work and I’ve heard that she is telling my uncles and cousins not to make contact with me, they have ignored her and they have come to see me but they darent tell her that they have. She is trying to make me out to be this bad person (I don’t think I am bad) so none of the family will speak to me. I honestly don’t know how to deal with it all now, I thought I had forgiven them but then something new always crops up. I’m sorry if I’m not making any sense. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Trigger warning!! ⚠️ 
So I just moved out of college


There has been many fights between me and my parents about move out. I kept asking for months, ""hey how are we going to move out?"", and then they just ignored me. They also kept telling me they would figure it out. I even tried to plan out a really good way to move out, and I already had everything in motion, but they called and cancelled all of it. Fast forward until two days until move out and they send me a condescending text saying that because of my poor planing, I need to sell all my stuff and get rid of my pet to move out. I of course told them there was no damn way I would eve do that and reminded them that I kept telling them we needed to plan for move out. They just kept insisting that I have to get rid of my pet. For context behind this next but, my dad was involved in a really bad divorce between him and his ex wife. During that, he quite literally through me in the middle and let his ex steal my identity and cancel all financial aid I had and ruin my credit score. He also let his ex take EVERYTHING I had and hold it for ransom. I know this probably sounds overdramatic, but when I say I have nothing, I have NOTHING. I told him that my pet was the ONE thing I had left on this planet, then one thing that cared for me. This went on back and forth for a while until he sent me a final text. 

In it, he basically explained that I've always been a burden to him and that I have NEVER sacrificed anything for him. He said I was extremely selfish and he would move me out this summer, but the would not be taking me for any breaks over next school year. He also said he would be taking my pet and would not let me have it back over the fall. He then blocked me.

Today when my mom picked me up, it was a even bigger shit show. She kept implying she may not show up and that she was well within her rights to not show up. She kept texting me demanding I apologize or else she'll leave me homeless, causing me to get really stressed and to Self-H again to try and dull out the stress and pain from the situation. I told her that I tried to plan something out before but they canceled that plan. I also tried to call my grandmother for help, and she just told me I should be more considerate of my mom's feelings, and that once again I've never had to loose anything before (she also knows I lost everything to my dad's ex). My mom then threw in a bunch of threats and told me to be prepared to jump in the car and leave as fast as possible (which I was fine with). When she arrived she shut off the AC and told me I didn't get those privileges any more. She then rolled down all the back windows where I was sitting and turned the radio to it's highest setting playing the loudest songs possible; keep in mind this wasn't a short drive. So for 6 hours on the interstate we drove with windows down and radios blasting. I tried to nap, and I kid you not she swerved the car near a ditch and turned around when I shot up and said, ""You do NOT get to sleep because you made me drive all the way out here"". I know if I tried to go back to sleep or talk back she would actually drive us into that ditch. 

I'm worried being back at the house, it's going to be an all out crap show. I'm always a scape goat and I know that they will find every little thing to blame me for. I also suffer from pretty bad depression and I'm worried it may drive me into doing something not good, it's already caused me to heavily think about it. I know the wise thing to do is to not stay and leave the house, but I have no friends or other family. If I leave I will be homeless with no money to my name after the court case. I just don't know what to do and I really don't think I can survive the whole summer if this is already where we are at."

"I was wondering if anyone else who had an abusive childhood is experiencing some of the symptoms I am. I have symptoms of fibromyalgia and joint pain. Also my glutes are really really sore to the touch. It feels like bee stings. 

I used to get beat as a child as a form of punishment and it just would turn to violence. The bee stings when I touch my glutes or when my husband touches my glutes reminds me of the same feeling I used to feel when getting beat. My whole body used to be sore to the touch and achy but now it’s getting better.  My glutes are horrible though!

Anyone else experiencing this?"
"My parent prided themself on neber physically abusing me. Well, i finally snapped (this man is disgusting, screaming at random children, telling me to shut up about my suicidal/homicidal ideations, calling me a tramp at 13 years old then inappropriately looking at my body and commenting on it, and that's the few things off the top of my head.) 

But he never physically assaulted me. 
Until today. He came in all pissy, and I tried to apologise. 
I don't remember most of the event because I was having a panic attack and trying to calm down, bur i snapped on him (he brought up my alcoholism in a very pathetic way because I asked him to take a step back) 
(I'm getting help for my alcohol abuse) 

But I started going off about everything.  Screaming and sobbing that he hasn't loved or even respected me for ages, and he plays ignorant to me all the time. 

He put his hands on my face / head and grabbed. 
This has set back several assault traumas by years. 

I remember screaming at him ""how fucking dare you?"" 
And his response was to simply laugh and say ""excuse you? What did you say to me? You've done the same thing to me thousands of times."" 

(I haven't,  but i vaguely resemble my mother who could be abusive. He uses this to excuse his sexualisation of me). 

I just... ""Everything but-"" isn't a good thing in abuse. It's a threat. And today my dad broke his promise that he'd never put hands on me.  

Fat fuck will die a lonely pervert. 
I do not have a ""dad"". 

I do have the privilege of my chosen family though 😍🥰
"
My father has been abusive to my mom and my brother  since forever. My brother moved out a few years ago and recently he has been physically and verbally abusive to me whenever i try to protect my mother from being beaten and abused. I cant seem to forgive him no matter what. This morning he was admitted to the hospital and turns out his condition is severe but i dont feel the least bit of sympathy for him. Although i feel a little guilty for not being sympathetic towards him today but i dont know if its alright to not forgive him for all the torture and trauma he has passed on to me. Can somebody pls tell me whats wrong and whats right?
"I hate my mum and I can’t wait until I have enough money to move you. 

(Sorry if grammar is bad, I’m writing this at work) (and sorry it’s so long) 

Disclaimer, I know I don’t have it nearly as bad as some people but I’m just frustrated 

I’m an 18yr old female and my mum is the most insufferable person I’ve ever met, she wasn’t always like this… in fact we were quite close when I was little, but as I’ve grown older I feel like she’s trying to control me and hates that I’m independent so she’s horrible to me? 

The breaking point was today when I was sitting down doing school work (I’m in uni study a very intensive double degree) she comes up to me and says “is it too much to ask you to go to the grocery shop” I explain to her I’m doing work and she tells me to go in 30 minutes then I explain to her that I’m doing a timed assessment that is due today and opened today so I need to do it and can’t stop because I’ll run out of time so she’s scoffed at me and goes “I used to go to the shop for you as a kid, why do I even bother with you” so while she was in the shower I go talk to my dad about how she’s being to me and she swings the door to my dads office open and says to me “bitching today about me?” Then proceeds to tell me I should of just gone to the shop and not been such a brat. 

When I was younger one of my most memorable things is that when I was (maybe 8-14?) she would force me to pull down my pants and show her my vagina, and because it didn’t look like hers (I was obviously still growing and barley hit pubity) she would always laugh and tell me it wasn’t normal. 

Over the years I’ve wrote down in my notes stuff she’s done so I’ll list some here:

-  I was unpacking the groceries and I told her the drinks wouldn’t fit in the fridge and she replied yelling “OP don’t be an obnoxious brat!” 

- she asked me to buy her a juice after work so I did and I bring it to her and she yells at me saying she didn’t want it and then she called me selfish 

- she told me to clean out the fridge and I was, then she goes into the kitchen and slams the fridge door shut (it was open and I was in between the fridge and the door because I was cleaning) and I tell her she hit me and she immediately told me I was being a drama queen and took my phone off me, then called me a smart as 


- I got broken up with and was upset so I want to talk to her and she told me to go away because she was tired, so I went into the bathroom to shower and closed the door and she screamed “OP SLAM THAT DOOR AND ILL SLAME YOUR FACE INTO IT” (I didn’t slam it) 

- when I was 17 she found out I was r**** and refused to talk to me for a week because I wasn’t a virgin 

Other things she does include-

- calling me a selfish bitch or a cow 
- calling me fat and ugly 
-making fun of what I wear 

And if I tell her something isn’t right or I don’t like something she’s doing or ask her to apologise for anything she’ll say something like 

- learn how to take a joke 
- you’re no fun 
- guess I won’t talk anymore then 
- you’re too sensitive 
"
"My mom will always make ""jokes"" about me being a ""dummy"" or being ""stupid"" and I hate it. Today she called me braindead and stupid 3 times because apparently being cut off mid-sentence while explaining something makes me sound dumb (she's the one who cut me off)- this has been going on since I was a baby with her saying she regrets having me and that she should've never had a kid. It's so annoying and I hate it when she calls me names but she just won't stop no matter how much I tell her to. Should I talk to my school counselor?"
"I have 2 older sisters and we're 7/8 years apart and ik they've suffered too. But I just see brothers protecting their younger siblings and I'm so fucking jealous. I just wish they wouldve protected me from my dad hitting/screaming at me. But at the same time I was really bad to my younger sister. Like I remember my friend slapping her really hard, and when she told an adult I just said I didn't see anything. And that's not even the only thing but it's probably the worse. I probably traumatized her or at least definitely made her childhood worse. But I swear I really do regret it, I apologised and we have a good relationship now. But all of that just makes me think that I shouldn't want to be protected if I couldn't protect her yk. I wish I had someone to protect me and I really wish I protected my sister too and I'm just so sorry about not being there for her when she was a kid but I was a kid too. "
"I've posted a couple times other spots, but I'll post again here too. I'm looking for more advice. My parent will act confusing sometimes to me. One minute they will be asking how my day was, the next giving my little brother a nose bleed. Or one minute giving me a hug, the next picking me up by my shirt whilst pinned against the wall and yelling at me. It is annoying, weird, and puts me on edge. I am at the point where I am anxious randomly all the time. Even at school. People at school will make fun of me or laugh at me too which makes it even worse. I need some way to express these emotions, but I am isolated. I am afraid all the time. I have become much more numb to my emotions and find it even harder to form any bonds with people or care about them. My behavior has also becoming increasingly more aggressive. Recently I actually hit my brother with a belt because I was angry at him and he responded with attacking me using a hanger.
Help?"
i realy like walking around my room but my parrents tell me they will take my computer away (i need it for school) and i just dunno is this abusive?
"Hi everyone. 23F. 

I’ve been coming to terms with how abusive my family has been my whole life. This has not been helped since I’ve come out as transgender. My ultimate goal is to be able to cut my family off financially. 

I’m very lucky to be in the financial position I’m in. I’ll be graduating college in December, but until then, my dad is helping pay for half of my rent and groceries, and I am on his insurance. I’m a type 1 diabetic, so I can’t afford to lose the luxury of this assistance.

For anyone who’s ever been in a situation of financial dependence - how do you break away?"
"She had me in shape wear/girdles from 5th grade until high school. Like I was 9-10 years old and she was actively asking me ""where's your girdle?"" before I left the house, buying me waist trainers and giving me her old ones. Always talked about me dieting or being too big and only ever praised me when i lost weight quickly (usually during depressive episodes). I ( while in HS) once wore a pair of pajama pants that were extra fluffly around the house after I had dropped some weight and when I walked past her she said ""You gained all that weight back"" while just shaking her head and looking disappointed.  Although there was no way for her to know I was already feeling self conscious when she said it, there was still no reason to say it at all. I had just started to recover from my ED and that one comment made me lose my appetite for 3 days. 

I'm good now for the most part, but she called and asked what she ever did to make me avoid her and that was the main thing on the list she refused to believe and I didn't want to full on argue about it, but I didn't want to sit on it either. "

"please dont say anything rude, I would like genuine advice. So I am F(23) and I am living with my ex M(24) after moving in with him into a home my parents  supposedly “bought” me. They own it, I have no lease, my parents who are millionaires, financially pay for my entire life, and control almost every aspect of my life (what job I can work, what I go to school for, and who I date and who I can bring to the house). I was emotionally and physically abused by them as a child, had distanced myself when I was 18 and moved out. last year they inherited millions and lured me back in with cheap rent in a huge house, promises to be kind to me, and when I did they threatened to evict me or call the police if I don’t do something they want me to do, especially if I don’t keep constant contact with them. My ex and I ended up getting really close to their friend group during this time. My ex who is extremely violent behind closed doors, and a compulsive liar, and serial cheater (hence why I am leaving him) but extremely charming to others, has convinced everyone that I am insane, or my parents have im not sure. My ex and parents have an extremely close relationship as well. they bought him a car, they financially support his life. I told my parents and ex I wanted to leave him and I wanted my ex to move out of the house they bought “ME” and my parents have cussed me out everyday since and even threaten to call the police to have me evicted from the home so that my ex can live there instead of me. They tell me I’m crazy and no one will ever love me except him. My ex has been hanging out with my parents friends well and the speaking about me constantly and they all came up with the conclusion I am having a nervous breakdown because it’s not rational to want to leave him I guess? When I try to explain my side, no one listens and they started sending me therapy links. I stopped hanging around them all, and my ex god to my family dinners without me. I started seeing another guy in hopes that my ex will leave the home on his own, and now he is just telling everyone we are not broken up and I am cheating on him. I went to the psychiatrist yesterday and she told me I’m not crazy and I’m acting exceptionally well despite the circumstances of what is going on. "

"before i start writing i feel like i’m about to tell some sort of horror story because there’s just crazy amounts of stuff that happened but basically, when i was younger my mum re married and he physically abused me for years of my life till i was 10 and i was in hospital from a injury, it’s something i’ll never understand but i know how fucked up it is, what’s more fugged up is how my mum stayed married to him and never seemed to be there to defend child me and she’s still married to him? i was taken out of her custody after this event and eventually saw her again but when i was 13-14 she stopped contacting me, i later found out that she had a mental breakdown and also lost custody of my brother (that’s a whole different story), what has brought this up in my mind is that her husband the guy who hurt me is now starting to hurt her with his mental abuses and all sorts of narcisstic tactics, im now 21 and she has told me that she is going to leave him, after all these years of her trying to make me and him have a relationship again, this all sounds so fucked up right? because it is fucked up what i’m trying to get some sort of help with is what do i now, she’s coming to me trying to get me to help with her with legal stuff and honestly i have no sympathy anymore i half hate her and half don’t understand how you could be like this to me my whole life ??? i’m expecting my first child any day now and she wants in on everything but i’m just done with the toxic environment i grew up in, what would you do? my problem is i can’t cut people off for shit"
"Okay, so. I am 12 years old. Every time my mom wakes me up on the weekends, she always starts yelling at me for no reason and beats me up. Recently, my mom got mad at me for not drinking my medicine, so she punched my eye which almost popped it out. This has been going on my entire life. I sometimes feel like killing myself. Once, me and my mom went to do the laundry and I was packing our clothes and she got mad that I wasn't doing it fast enough and she beat me in public. Other people in the store told her to stop and they kicked her out the store. She got so mad that when i got home she beat me  until my butt was bleeding and I begged and she wouldn't stop. She finally stopped when her friend called her. Whenever i missed the bus (because my mom would chase me around the house with a hanger and beat me) she gets mad and blames me and doesn't take me to school that day and makes me put my hands up like a slave on the wall and if I don't she will beat me. She always cursed at me like when I talk for example: If i said something, she would tell me to shut the f\*\*\* up.  She always blames stuff that happens even if I didn't do it. She gets mad if i forget to close the bathroom door and slaps me. And whenever it's a school night, she doesn't even care if I sleep late or not. She forces me to stay up to help her clean her bowls which takes forever and if I complain she beats me. She even beat me when I was only 4 years old. I once was 4 and she gave me rice and some soup I didn't like so I told her I didn't want it so she beat me up with a stick until i begged for mercy and ate the whole thing. I sometimes pray to god to die because of how she treats me. "
"Hello everyone. I'll l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of what's up. 


I just need people's views on wether this is normal or not, or not that bad, or fucked up, or whatever. But I need either the dismissal for this not being ""that bad"" or validation so I don't feel guilty for how I feel. It's also weirdly empowering (instead of victimizing) when I acknowledge that the things I'm going to describe speak poorly of them and that I can see that. I dont feel like bringing this up to my friends. 


Before laying it out I'd like to get another thing off my chest: I feel like I'm misleading you because I'm not mentioning much of the stuff I did wrong. But I never put my family in danger, nothing close to that (that is the only reason for hitting someone that I could justify). But I was still made to feel like the things I did where very bad. Also feeling guilty because it's not the typical abusive household where I'm getting punished for no reason, it's a loving place. I'm aso conflicted because this person has a reputation as a very dependable friend and also he is not egotistical. But idk still this doesn't sit right with me. 


I'm 23. Family is from Eastern Europe, Soviet-ish culture. Immigrated to Argentina in 2000, that's when I was born. 



My life up until 7yo: I don't remember anything basically. So, all of this is what I've been told. Father lied a lot and was hysterical, when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes, my mother always put me in another room so I wouldn't witness that. When I was 1 I was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out, dad wanted me to stop, I didn't so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door. At some point during this period up until 7yo he said that i should ""fear him, like an animal"". He never laid a hand on me but had outbursts. When I'm 7 mom divorces him. 


So after that, I've always lived with my mom, grandparents and uncle (all maternal) up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place, visits weekly. 


Dad left the country 4 years later, when I was 11, and before that he'd pick me up 3/4 times a year. I'm told I wasn't really sad when he left. Btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me. Musicians are evil freemasons, the number 11 everywhere, that kinda thing. Once at like 10yo, in the shower, I broke down and called my mom to talk because I couldn't handle all the bad-mouthing that my father was talking about them (my family). I went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when I was 20 and luckily snapped out of it. 


So after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure. Which I guess was even more so when my actual father left the country. From this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which I feel have conditioned me, I'll share a few representative examples. 


We were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking I told him to ""shut up"" (in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up), the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheek/mouth from his part.


This was some months later I'm sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks. Uncle comes in says we are eating soon so don't eat any more chocolate. When he came back to call me to dinner he sees I ate all the chocolate, takes the water bottle and empties it on my head. It was at keast half full, because I remember even the matress soaking on the part I was sitting. He told me to stay there, so I couldn't change and even had to sleep on that matress. Idk how this would make you feel but for me it's a good example of the humiliation, anger, shame and whatnot that I felt with some frequency from his actions. Given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me, I always felt intimidated, afraid, so I didn't express those emotions and swallowed them all, repressing. At most I'd cry silently for a bit, or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror (silently of course) for a moment and stopped it.


So this is an example that's easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating, angering, etc. He would do something like that once a month, or twice a week, depending on my behavior. 9/10 times it was something ""small"", unlike the example I gave which is obvious to anyone, but those small things would also fill me with tears, shame and whatever. And, like I said, there was a frequency to it. Maybe it was misbehavior at school, or half assing some chore and he'd say something, sometimes normally sometimes not so much so. Something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably ""small"" for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation. This continued until I was around 14. 


We'd still laugh, play fight, and those things. The negative situations were a small portion of the time we spent together. But the influence of his skewed methods was evident. I was violent with my friends at school, like I'd twist their arm so they would admit I'm right or something, or making them flinch. I was never a bully, mind you, all of this was normal playing for me. I would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything. Once I was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foot/toed, it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part. No notable reaction from his part, just disbelief as in what's wrong with you. 


When I was 13 I lied big time for the first time ever (I skipped class and didn't give my parents the school's note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol) and when found out, I was grounded like this: I could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia, and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday, where I was so happy for them to finally smile at me. For this family lying is a big thing, in case you haven't noticed (it's a joking comment but also serious, they were very big on me telling the truth)


I fail high school like three or four times. I just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food, drinking coca cola etc. When I was 16 I guess, studying for a subject I had to pass to pass the year, my parents (mon and uncle) wanted to make sure I studied so he controlled the process. I went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone. After 3/4 hours uncle comes in and starts testing what I should have studied. I don't answer, I'm getting very anxious (like I am now just typing this out) in my belly (which always happened when I knew he would get angry after finding out about something I did wrong) and he understood what I had been doing so he takes my phone, puts it on the floor, grabs a thermos I had laying around and holds it above my phone, looking at me and asking me what was I really doing, he was barely containing his temper, his nostrils were flaring. I swore I just couldn't study or concentrate so he'd spare the phone. Something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like he'd drop it.


Some years later I'd be, again, failing the year so I had to pass on the subjects I owed. To make it simple there was an option where I could choose between a hard exam and an easy one. He said I should do the hard one, of course I agreed, but later I took the easy one. We were in my room when he found out. He went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg, where it hits a nerve or smt. He came up to my face and I instinctively covered my belly... He saw this and told me I shouldn't protect myself from him, that this was all due to my decisions or whatever. 


Not long after that I guess I failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because I was ""driving my mom crazy"" which is partially true btw, I was really stressing her out. I was lying to her every year, telling her I was studying and that I was passing my exams. 


Around this time I was hanging out at a friend's place and some movement he did made me flinch, something that had never happened with him. It wasn't even a sudden motion haha. I felt so anxious and ashamed God.


At some point he was ""done with me"" after I once more showed no cooperation with his ""help"". Literally, he said he'd be there for what's needed like he's not pretending I don't exist, but like our friendly relationship was over, basically for lying. Eventually I apologized and we had a long conversation, what he said boiled down to ""I'll really try but it'll be hard to rebuild trust, you can't mess up you understand? This time There will be no coming back from that one"". Mind you, this was a very serene, ""reasonable"" conversation! We were very calm and ""mature"". Btw, this happened one or two more times 😂. Like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and I were in the same room (cuz we'd barely talk and if I asked smt indirectly to him he'd be short, disinterested or didn't say anything) 


Anyway, I'm 23 now, he hasn't put a hand on me since that last time I mentioned. Of course still an intimidating man. Strong control issues. Constantly needs to prove to you that he is right. Very irritable. Oh and some months ago I brought up the subject mentioning how I don't know how it would turn this time out if he were to hit me now that I'm 23. He said calmly **""I'm still capable of turning you into a handicapped person""**


Now, a disclaimer: while on the emotional level there's tons of fear, resentment and anger towards him, cognitively I KNOW where he was coming from I'm not saying it was RIGHT, I'm saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow, the subconscious, repressed emotions or whatever term. It's not that  they don't know the importance of working on this and letting these things out, they don't even think there's anything ""wrong"". I've brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle. He just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem, to put it succinctly. No apology. My mom wasn't very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didn't see the emotional damage. He thinks he had to do it, but I Know that in reality he was, and is, carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization ""you were driving your mom mad"" ""you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time"" etc. I'm actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing. Lol. I was also told to basically stop victimizing myself.


He is like this but since he doesn't go around flipping out on everybody, nor did he do anything to me ""unjustified"", he was never stopped. I believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate. 


So as I said, on the mental aspect I know there's no point in looking for guilty ones, but emotionally I want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself. 


When I don't distract myself with the phone or any activity, some emotions come to attention, I may even cry for a second. This makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which I only have to let work by unclenching muscles, releasing mental tension, just relaxing and letting myself feel everything I've supressed for so long. 


I feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe that's buried even deeper.


Also I'm anxious about the moment I let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me. Like I can't make something up and but also the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible, or they'd just assume I was projecting the trauma from my biological father on my uncle. Lol. Sad. But I'll just let go at some point and that's it.


I've stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family, it's not wise to need their understanding, even if it's family.


I've come to realize that my social anxiety, awkwardness, emotional coldness towards family (I cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion. Gosh my grandma is severely ill and I struggle to be compassion, like I know it's there somewhere I can feel it sometimes but there's so much repressed BS covering it up), irritability towards family and many other things, are a result of this. This is good news for me because I now know it's not just random but a result of the mind's shadow.

"title. basically a run down

im 14, time of the incident was around my bday. i was abusing benadryl and alcohol and other stuff to cope. mom found out, and instead of being caring (since she knows i have a history with self harm) she went on a fucking. rampage. yelling at me, not letting me process anything.

cue the argument heading downstairs, and it got a lot more heated. im crying and yelling at this point, not knowing how to handle anything. shes still screaming and extremely pissed. then, something i did made her snap. she hit me across the face and 'accidentally' broke my nose. i broke down even more, holding my hand under my nose and asking her for help. her response? 'its just a nosebleed.'

i eventually get it to stop by myself (in the bathroom with the door shut.) i leave the bathroom after not looking like i was crying, and my moms friend is over. to help *my mom* cope. while i am still extremely upset.

so fastforward to that evening because i dont remember much, my mom calls the FUCKING POLICE. because i was getting high on an allergy pill. police arrive, but im still in my pjs/gown with no panties on. (btw, all 4 officers were men.) im freaking out and being asked to change so they can take me to the hospital, and then i just went into full on panic mode. i was trying to delay them but after a while they made me leave my room. they dragged me down the stairs by my arms, all the while yelling to my mom who was behind them that it hurts and she said 'stop overreacting.' 

said officers strap me to a stretcher while i am still actively panicking, so i panic more. im loaded up into the ambulance without my mom, completely by myself without my phone. we get to the hospital, and im only able to cover my legs with a white sheet.

we waited for FOUR HOURS, no mental eval. the doctors knew my mom hit me and broke my nose, but they did nothing. we went home at 12am and i got my phone back the next day, but i didnt even care.

i dont know what to do. i didnt get any proof. corporal punishment is legal in my state but not like this. i told my friend but i was too scared to get them to call cps. im terrified of my mom now and ive told her. shes always been physical with punishment and it got worse when she found out i was cutting myself. my dad is about the same. i dont go to in person school until next year and i dont wanna be taken away from my house because they still get me stuff and it isnt that often. the worst thing right now is the constant arguing but im not in danger. i dont wanna hurt my parents but i dont know how to cope anymore. i deal with shit at school and at home. ive been mostly able to block out remembering everything but it just hit me like a truck. i just dont wanna be scared of my parents like i am now. i just had to play off the fact of why i was crying to my mom. i just feel like im stuck. i love my parents and i dont wanna leave them but i hate them at the same time. theyve never been there for me emotionally.

advice please. thank you."
"Im currently a 24F, the oldest daughter of the household, has a younger brother that is currently in high school, and I have a rather difficult and unstable relationship with my mother. However, even though our relationship has been toxic for as long as I can remember; that doesn't stop me from wanting to have a good relationship with her. There was a time where two years ago, I wanted to cut off all contact and go ""No contact,"" because I figured that was the best for me at the time; but flash forward to now, I realized that I felt guilty for wanting to go no contact, and am now trying to repair the broken relationship. I'm not sure whether its my inner child talking, or the ""oldest sibling trauma bond,"" that ties me close to her, or if deep down, I really truly want to have a relationship with her. 

Just to give some background information; both my parents are in a loveless marriage - but refuses to divorce and currently still lives in the same household. I am no longer living with them, but I still live rather close. I would say my current relationship with my mom is a little better than the relationship I had with her when I still lived at home; I would say it was more so physically abusive where she would throw silverware at me, hit me, and there was no sense of privacy at home. Since I am now no longer financially bound to her, she can't do those things. However, that doesn't stop her being very emotionally abusive and mentally very draining. She tends to be very jealous of my happiness in terms of wanting to hang out with my friends, constantly projects her insecurities onto me (since shes not in a happy marriage, she tells me not to ""waste time"" on building romantic relationships, or that friends doesn't matter as much as her (since she does not have friends). When I communicate to her that I want to be there emotionally for a friend or wants to spend time with a friend, she questions why I am wasting my life, and how no one will stay in my life forever. And this leads me down into a downward spiral of anxiety believing no one will stay with me or put up with me because she drills the mindset that ""no one will want to put up with me, that if I am a horrible daughter, why would anyone else want me?"" 

Keep in mind - I have always been a reasonable daughter. I have always passed all my classes, did well in school, took care of my brother, cooked for the family when my mom would go on vacation, I was there emotionally for my mom when she wanted to talk, was never judgemental, and always tried my best to see her. However, her nagging and persistent guilt tripping never ceases. She always picks at my appearance, my weight, claims that I'm a failure for not ""making enough,"" that I am not focusing on myself enough. There's so much more, but on to the topic of this post. Just recently, I was cleebrating my best friends birthday and was out at around 7-9pm for a painting session. I was not on my phone, but then took it out after I painted my mural and came to 10 missed calls from my mom back to back. I immediately got on the phone with her and told her where I was but she proceeded to guilt me for ""wasting time,"" and claimed that I see my best friend more than I see her. (keep in mind that I try to see my mom as much as I can, on average I see my mom at least three times a month). She told me that all I do was waste time, and then hung up on me when I was trying to explain myself - that caused my mood to steadily shift, and I wasn't able to enjoy myself. She then proceeds to text me quite like sending 10-20 texts exclaiming that I was ""still a child"" for not getting why she was calling so much, when I was trying to explain to her that she was making me feel uncomfortable and that I was trying to enjoy my night without her guilting. That led to her calling me immature and proceeds to not listen to me. By that time, I was fed up and then left the birthday celebration early because I felt too guilty for staying longer. 

It just sucks because I feel like there are times my mom and I can seldom get along and have a good time, but it just never lasts. When I do have a good time with her, it makes me disassociate and lowkey convinces me that none of it is real - that she is only nice to get something from me. That even if she is nice, I can never fully be myself without feeling judged. I do not feel comfortable with confiding in her about anything, because her first response is always to judge me for my mistakes, and never to comfort or guide me. She is a ball of negativity, and I can never feel truly at ease. She can be very volatile with her words and actions, and it is hard for me to predict what she will do next. Today, I thought about doing therapy for the first time, especially to bring her along with me for the journey. I decided to research some therapists within our insurance network and thought to myself how she would take my idea. So I decided to message her and ask whether she was willing to do therapy to fix/improve our relationship, since she has told me various times when she was in a good mood that she wants to be closer to me. She responds with ""what?!"" in a very judgemental way, and I proceeded to explain to her that I think it would be good for our relationship and for both of us individually to be able to emotionally connect and bond, and she has not responded to me. It has been a full day, and it is abnormal for her to not respond. Usually when she is like this, she does not agree with my ideas and refuses to communicate. 

I'm not sure if it is even worth for me to try to convince her that therapy can be a good idea, if that was her initial reaction. I feel as if my whole life, I have to beg her or reason with her a thousand times to get her to see from my perspective. She is an extremely stubborn, selfish woman with possibly undiagnosed narcissism, and I'm not sure if I should even try. I'm very mentally drained to the point of giving up and not even trying anymore on our relationship because it just feels like nothing is changing. 

Any kind of thoughts or commentary would help. :) I would really appreciate it!!

"Long post. I'm writing this to vent, for acknowledgment, and to possibly ask some questions. But mainly for venting because I feel so alone regarding this. I'll l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of what's up. 


I'm 23. Family is from Eastern Europe, Soviet-ish culture. Immigrated to Argentina in 2000, that's when I was born. 


My life up until 7yo: I don't remember anything basically. So, all of this is what I've been told. Father lied a lot and was hysterical, when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes, my mother always put me in another room so I wouldn't witness that. When I was 1 I was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out, dad wanted me to stop, I didn't so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door. At some point during this period up until 7yo he said that i should ""fear him, like an animal"". He never laid a hand on me but had outbursts. When I'm 7 mom divorces him. 


So after that, I've always lived with my mom, grandparents and uncle (all maternal) up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place, visits weekly. 


Dad left the country 4 years later, when I was 11, and before that he'd pick me up 3/4 times a year. I'm told I wasn't really sad when he left. Btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me. Musicians are evil freemasons, the number 11 everywhere, that kinda thing. Once at like 10yo, in the shower, I broke down and called my mom to talk because I couldn't handle all the bad-mouthing that my father was talking about them (my family). I went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when I was 20 and luckily snapped out of it. 


So after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure. Which I guess was even more so when my actual father left the country. From this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which I feel have conditioned me, I'll share a few representative examples.

"  TW Ab4se

Hello, Im a 15 year old soon to be 16 year old  in an mentally and verbally abusive relationship. I have been abused by my father  almost as long as I can remember. I have wanted out for years but I couldn't do that to my dad. 

   While my dad is an abusive human being he does have times when he seems like a great dad.  Like when he would get me ice cream or listen and try to help me when I was bullied in elementary school. I wanted to leave but since my dad still showed a nice side even though a lot of it was out of wanting to control me. I thought I could fix him or make him a better father but I was wrong. No matter how hard I tried to tell him what he was doing was wrong. whether it was yelling loudly at me for small things or blaming his behavior on me or claiming it wasnt abuse  he never listened or tried to change his behavior. There was a lot more he did then that I just wanted to give some examples.( He convinced it wasnt abuse when I was a little kid.

   Now that I am 15 and I am finally realizing he wont change and staying because I don't wanna hurt him isn't worth it I want out, I finally took my moms offer to get full custody of me. Yesterday we finally sat down as a family. Me, my mom and my stepdad. (My mom silt from my dad a long time ago but they never married just had a long term relationship.( I explained what I wanted and why. They already had known about it for years and they wanted to get me out a while ago. 

   The thing is since my mom and step dad started doing research about how getting full custody would work. And my mom ask her friends who had been in custody battles. They figured out that it would almost be impossible for my mom to get full custody because he never hit me or assaulted me. And how then can last over an year and it wasn't worth it because of how close I am to 18. They said they really wanted to but there were so many things in the way. And that it would completely ruin me and my dads relationship that is ruined all ready and how it would it be really mad for my already bad mental health. 

   I talked to my therapist about this and she said she would email my mom and try to figure something out but there's still a big chance it wouldn't work. I really cant take anymore. I was done a long time ago. I'm so tired. I just want it to end. So I'm on abuse reddit  looking for hel. I known that states handle this kind of thing differently. I live in oregon if that helps. If anyone can help PLEASE do.

Also sorry that this was long and all the background information. 😥"
abusive household. i dont have alot of freedom and i dont know how to really be independent as parents have always took control over everything in my life. what do i need to prepare? whatever the cost is ill try my best to earn it. what are some expenses ill need to keep in mind? im currently saving up 
"my parents were barely present for me growing up, and when they actually here the only attention i got from them was them yelling at me and being upset

now in people i have attraction too its always cold and dismissive people, emotionally unavailable, people that dont properly love me. im always chasing after their validation its like a high for me. i dont like people that care for me too much, that are emotional and too loving. i hate that im like this ill never be happy. even if i get away from my parentd they have affected my future relationships and ill always have this trauma "
"my parents are abusive and theres been times where i wanna call the cops on them, but they hold evidence against me so i cant do anythinng
i forged my mom's signature to try to open a bank account since my parents wont help me make one myself and at the time i thought iy would be a good idea
i had a meltdown one time and threw something at my mom. i have bad anger issues and my parents were aggrivting me on purpose
my dad recorded it and i ran to the basement, they were sil recording me and my mom got on me and was holding me down. i was having a panic atyaxk and i was begging her to let go and i was overstimuated. i tried yo push me off and she wouldnt so i started to pull her hair and bite her as hard as i could, then my dad got a glass of cold water and threw it on me

i feel pressured into being silenced i cant get help, i usually never get agressive woth my parents but being abusived for years i snapped. i hold np evidence against my parents so theyll always have something against me. im so scared of them"
does anyone else have a hard time recalling traumatic events. sometimes i wanna vent about how abusive my parents are but then ill forget what theyve done.. i know theyve done some horrible things tp me but its hard remembering specifically what.. because i camt remember it makes me feel like its not a big deal on whatever yhe fuck they did to me
"Hi, this is my first time in reddit, anyways, to keep it short, my parents refused to let me inter university of my choice even though it’s free, and forced me into the nearer college where there is like 4 major or something like that, and none of them was for me none of them was even the choice number five on my list, i really tried to get into it and continue my life, but I simply couldn’t, I couldn’t study something i will never get a job with, there is no jobs for me with this major so what’s the point? This drove me into depression more, i have no future career, i have a hobby which i want to develop into business but the stress from the college and my parents can’t let me do anything, its started to affect me physically, panic attacks, throwing up, severe insomnia, and others, my parents are controlling and don’t really about what anyone want, hell even they don’t want anything, they never wanted me to be successful at all, they prevented me from getting any kind of job through high school, i am broke I can’t even get out, i am trying to make some money online but as i said stress and anxiety are eating me alive, what should i do?! My father doesn’t care that much about me going to college because either way, he wont give me a penny, nothing new there, the problem is my mom, she skipped college because of my father, and my father in short is and emotionally abusive and a narcissist who mad my mother’s life hell, she is obsessed over college because she thinks her life would better with a degree, but i know that a degree wouldn’t help her leaving my father 20 years ago so it’s irrelevant… "
"That's all I can label this as right now. I am currently a F(17) with 7 sisters. 3 moved out and one doesn't live with me so I'm not counting them. That means there are 3 sisters that live with me. Now, I didn't realize this before, but my mom is a major bully. 

I should've realized it from middle school when my mom read my diary. She sat me down to make me watch her read it and continued to make me sit while she told me why my thoughts were wrong. She also does this thing. When she tells us to do something that we don't quickly do or we don't understand, she talks in a way that makes us seem retarded and says ""Because this is the only way I can make you understand."" My sisters encourage it by laughing but I don't think that's very funny. Probably because I've been called stupid twice by her and ignorant once.

She's also made me feel like I'm ungrateful. I probably am. I have so many electronics from her (a phone, a laptop, a TV, a tablet) and she keeps food in our stomachs with a place to live. But, if I know one thing about manipulation, it's that people will do whatever it takes for you to let them keep treating you the way they are. Every time she and my dad would argue, we'd go somewhere fun like bowling, or she'd sit us down to talk about it and ask us how we felt. She doesn't really care. She has told me a lot that she doesn't care what I think. That it's disrespectful if I try to tell her why something isn't a good idea. She would also go out of her way to explain to me, her child btw, what's going on with her situation with my dad why she hates him, and why he doesn't care about us. He does btw. 

She also goes out to make it like something's my fault when she could've chosen an easier route. I'm not comfortable talking about that story yet, but she gaslights a lot.

I cry... a lot. I'm a Pisces, what can I say? But, when I do, my mom calls me a crybaby. Remember when she read my diary? Afterward, she asked me if I was done with my ""woe is me act."" But, I feel like my ""act"" is a way better reaction than having temper tantrums like she does. She once threw something at her bedroom door and it went into the kitchen and almost hit me. Not to mention the amount of times she slammed her door.

Please don't tell me to talk to her about it, because she's too stubborn. Even her own family sees it. I can't bring in a trusted adult, none of that. And, get this, she's already in therapy. I just hate this woman! And I don't want to, but I do.  I want to get out of here, but I want to also protect my sisters from her. All of them! One of them is my half, so my dad probably won't be able to take custody of her."
"Hi. Today I needed to find the answer to my question. Are my parents Abusive? Growing I always knew that I was different. For one I’m short. I’m 15 and I’m 5ft so I was bullied for that. And anytime I try to stand up for myself my dad would beat me with his belt. And I guess I was the baby of the house I didn’t really had to do anything which would eventually hurt my in the future. So all of these things made me weak and introverted. And I think growing up we were poor. One time I remember that we could afford the electricity bill and me and my sisters had to give our money to our mom to pay it. My and my brother didn’t even have a console or anything like that because according to my dad “ it’s a waste of time” I wasn’t allowed to go over to other peoples houses because according to my dad “ i need to study “ but it was perfectly fine for him to take us to his friends houses. I think his beating went too far. Like for example he caught my older brother lets calling him Tyler drawing on the walls and he beat him. But one event that happened to me I will never forget. One day after swim practice which I hated and got no say in my dad was cussing Tyler out because I think he joked or threaten to shoot ip his middle school. He was in 8th grade and I was in 5th grade. I chuckled like and idoit until after I finished taking a shower. When I heated my twin let’s call her Leah and came run to her. I found out to Tyler ran away and after hours we found him at the public pool. I still remember that night eating food with the last Fanta bottle and my sisters watching Olympic swimmers. It was traumatizing. And I was afraid of getting beaten or getting in trouble so didn’t tell my teachers or friends. when I went during the summer I visited my cousins in Spokane wa. And after that I had to live I. My parents other house because we couldn’t afford to live in our original home. So after weeks of sleeping and doing nothing because I didn’t have a phone at the time but my sisters did because my mom had to find a way to communicate with us directly the school year started. But then Covid 19 came in March 2020 and when we were released to spring break that break lasted the rest of the year even though we still had to do our work online. In my 7th grade I was online till may to do my starr test. Online sucked and the teachers didn’t really care about us online kids. 8th grade year and I thought it would be different but I was wrong. Eventually my dad said we were moving to Spokane and I was excited because it was a new start for me. But when I left I winter break I barely got my old friends contacts and I have been trying to contact them ever since. My new middle school was okay but I was very alone at the beginning. Then my freshman year rolled in and was okay. Oh I forgotten to mention that during my 8th grade year my older brother Tyler to my older sister lets call her Jackie if she wanted to sigh up for driving class because she as a sophomore at the time and refused this will be important later on. So then my sophomore year came and it was okay at the start but it took a turn for the worst. So took get money we would have to do the clothes for the patients my parents were working to take care of. In fact we live above them In a basement. That’s why we moved here. But lately we have stoped doing them because our mother wouldn’t pay us on time. So after weeks of this my mother came downstairs with a broom to beat my sisters and I had enough. Even though Tyler was across from my mom I had to go and stop her and to still her to leave. Then my twin Leah was bruised on the hand my older sister left the house for safety with my cousins. And after weeks of her staying with them she came back. During our spring break at the end of it in April I had to go stay upstairs to watch the patients but I had to go for my hair cut with Tyler so it was Leah or Jamie and it couldn’t really be Leah because she had stayed up their for any hour but Jamie could do it because she had to go out with her friend. This is get too long but I will com with apart two to this so stay tune.  

Update 1: Jamie and my Mom had a huge argument. Jamie said that her friends moms always treat their daughters better than our mom does. While either they are stay at home moms, or they actually manage and be engaged with daughters to cook food for them. I think one of the main reasons is because we live in an adult family home where the patients live with us. So my dad and my have to take care of them 24 hours a day. She doesn’t have time to cook us dinner every night and the food that she does cook is for the patients which I DO NOT EAT because it used canned foods. Usually Tyler cooks us dinner or we would have to manage on our own. Going back to the situation the argument escalated and my mom said if these friends moms were better than her then she should go live with them. And that’s what Jamie did. She packed some of her stuff and left. When me and Tyler came back, me and him had no idea of the situation that happened. Mom was just saying how ungrateful Jamie was and stuff. Then at around 8pm when I was on my phone Leah came up to me to whisper that Jamie was not coming back. Then my dad came to Leah and Jamie room to interrogate Leah on the whereabouts of my sister which she didn’t know. Dad then called Jamie with Leah phone saying you need to return now but Jamie refused.  That night I could barely sleep because I didn’t know how to process this situation. What about school? In days following the event I was scared that my parents will forcefully take my sister back at lunch where half the school is to each lunch. I can’t describe the anxiety that came. So I talk to my world history about this and he had is suspicions on what was going on because Jamie was acting strange in his class. But when didn’t have time to talk and suggest to go to the counselor office. I did and talked with my 10th and 12th grade counselor and they really helped me. After a couple of weeks they successfully got me sister back after wanting to ask the police to label her as a runaway. Honesty looking back on it now both sides to blame.  My parents for not wanting to talk it out. They have a “ it our way or no way” attitude. One of the main reasons of Jamie running is because of the lack of space in the house. Like I said we live in an adult family home where patients live. They all have either room to themselves with an exemption.       But we live downstairs which is a weird living room basement hybrid. They are only 2 rooms downstairs one for my parents and one of my sisters. Me and Tyler have no room and live in the “ living room”. It sucks because there is no privacy.  Worse there is also a kitchen here and people can just walk in uninvited in my space. So when ever I want to jack off I have to do it under my blanket. And my parents what I do under my blanket as if I making cocaine under their when I’m just a hormonal teenager. It is a nightmare living here. When we first moved I thought we just be staying here for a couple of months until we bought another house to live in. We actually did. Although that house was still going to be an adult family home the space downstairs was nice but only had 2 bedrooms. But I was still happy it a massive living room downstairs which could install a lock making it my own room. But of course life could never be that easy. We later found out that my parents were going to rent out the rooms for money even though we moved all of our stuff in the garage.

Words cannot describe how shocking and devastating this news was. 

Of all the times to have privacy being a teenager had to be the most important. It is also a reason I haven’t bring any friends to my house because I’m embarrassed of the patients and how unclean the house is.  Even if it was clean there is no room to do anything. 

Everything has been okay recently but I truly wish for things to get better. Sometimes I look at the stars at night saying to myself when I become famous to never forget where I came from.  Where a hormaonal teenager had to with sever paitents that need a lot of care with no room to myself and my parents being fucking bitches. More updates in the future will come. So stay tuned"
"I broke a lamp, I was joking with my mother and I extended my arm to emphise something and knocked over a lamp. My mom kneeled next to it and was about to start screaming at me. I took my phone, water, shoes and left the house immediately. I forgot my earphones though, so thats sad. This has happend a lot, it slowed down a lot more recently but eh, guess some things never do change.

So I'm just outside, it's 3 am and I just feel empty. I always do during these sorts of things. It's easier that way, I don't feel regret. I don't really feel afraid. I feel midly disguisted with myself thst I bothered my friend for comfort. I'm pretty sure this is dissociation, and I don't know. I'm bored, I can't listen to music. I mean I could, but I dont ant to bother the other tenets here.

Someone got shot and robbed yesterday so this probably isn't safe 

Just looking to chat I guess in thr comments, no dms

"Ever since I could remember I've hated my life. My sisters are spoiled and crazy to say the least.  they would always get their way with my mother. My father was always working somewhere so he had no idea about this at the time and my 2 brothers would always go with him because they were ""old enough"" so It would always be my abusive part of the family and 4y/o me. My mom hated me, hated taking care of me, hated my voice, everything. She would often hit me for the littlest things, and every single time all I would see is her fist before getting whacked in the head. I often was just left shaking and crying alone. She was abusive physically and mentally often bringing me down when I accomplished something or calling Me a ""mistake."" She would often encourage my sisters to do also which only hurt me worse. After a year of that same process about everyday my parents started having problems. My mom was having an affair with a guy who I will call ""Pedro""
You see Pedro was a guy who essentially drove my family to shredding its self to pieces. He alone remains the one human who I want to cause brain trauma to with my fists alone. He was  fucking my mom without my dad knowing for about a year. Once my dad found out he was devastated. This devested me as my dad was and still is a really good person. Seeing him cry hit my heart harder than a bullet. Pedro encouraged my mother to hit my dad as she hit me. Which she did. And my father being the good person he is never hit her back he just avoided any physical problems from her. This was when she tried to get lethal with him and almost killed us in the process. She also began hitting me more and also started on my other brothers. My sisters ofcourse joined in. For a few weeks I endured this  until I snapped at my two sisters. I beat the shot out of then (I was 5 and them being 13 and 14) and since I'm naturally really strong I ended up breaking their noses and busting one of their lips. My mom was not happy. She cursed at me grabbed a metal rod and whacked me in the jaw breaking a lot of my teeth and drawing out a ton of blood. About an hour later my dad came home and he saw my bloody mess of a face and he finally realized what my mom does to us (we never told him due to fear). He started yelling at my mom to the point in which she grabbed that same rod and tried to whack him in the head full force. He had to run out since she could and would kill him if he didn't. He essentially had to go hide out for about a day in his truck in fear for his life. My mom later began packing her things and literally dragged my brothers and me to the car dropping us off on some dark alley in the middle of the night just so she can prove a point to my dad that she is not playing. After she essentially abandoned us probably heading to Pedro's place. Our dad ended up finding us. We told him everything and he was again devastated from the fact that she abandoned us and went with that piece of shit of a human Pedro. When  went home our sisters were nowhere to be seen meaning that they went with her. But the worst thing is that they trashed our house. Destroyed everything and threatened us with even worse. It was so bad that we had to get legal. And since we were not financially stable we could not afford a lawyer till then end of this legal battle which lasted 3 years. And since we had no evidence the cops could not do nothing. No DNA no cameras nothing. So for about 5 months our dad had to stay home without working just to raise us (by this point I was 7). After those 5 months ended we heard glass shatter in a lot of windows. And I recognized the people, they were my mothers friends who were gangsters or just bad people. The first thing they did is break the only phone that we had so we could not record nor call the cops. They then demanded for us to go with them essentially a kidnapping scenario. But because they caused such a ruckus our neighbor who I'll call ""Juan"" came out with a shotgun threatening them and scaring them off .he then called the cops and some of them got arrested. and they asked us to share details to them so we told them who they were sent by my mom, so ofc they went and interegated her. Which she had her family alibi her along with her friends and some co workers ending up with an Unsolved case. So all we could do now is just save up money and plead in court. 2 years later when I turned 10 we testified in court and we ended up getting re compensated 10k In damage and my dad got full custody of me and my brothers while my mom with my sisters. And for a year we lived in piece. When I turned 11 we (my dad and brother and me) were evicted from out house we would remain homeless for about another year till we managed to rebt out a beat up old home to maintain us as we stay financially in trouble. I later am forced to work for anything (fixing cars, selling candy at school, lawn mowing, etc...) selling candy was the best for me as I was a good negotiator which helped with rent just barely enough to get by. And 2 years later we still are financially struggling but now I get to feel what an average boy my age feels and I've never been so happy. While my mom gets abused now by that mf Pedro. Which is deserved but still angers me. But I'll let them settle it. Its sad that 13 years of my life were completely shit but on the bright side I'm stronger physically and mentally. And I will get money and I will help My dad out get his dreams when I'm older. Get him a truck or buy him a nice house in the coast as he always dreamed of. Mark my words...

Note: I'm 13 now and am now for the first time in my life have friends.

Note 2 : I still love my mom and my sisters 

Note 3: my sisters are a lot calmer now but they do drugs which is retarded but it their life now.

Note 4: my dad's side of the family lives In my home country Honduras which is why they were not involved. If they were things would have ended up way better

Final note: I left out a lot of things some are worse than this but, those are things that are really personal

Thank you for your time, and goodnight"

" TW: Family abuse, suicide.

Summary: sick of supporting my mum when all she does is complain and put me and my child at risk.

It has been nearly 20 years since my mum has pulled me into her DV situation (emotional, coercive, financial abuse). Most recently she tried to OD this week because of my dad's abuse and I supported her for a few days at my place after she was released from emergency.

I'm feeling really frustrated, sad and disappointed because the help I have been giving her was thrown back into my face over the last two days. 

Specifically, I helped get her a counsellor appointment and secure her banking/phone/email as my dad has all her passwords. She forgot her phone code and went off at me; she was the one that set it. She then went on and on about how I'm adding more fuel to the fire by making her do stuff (I wasnt, I was working) and I'm just causing her more problems and not giving her space to think. I've taken time off work to help her, I've spent hours collecting evidence for her when she asked, and I've been getting advice and helplines and provided her phone numbers. She's the one that has been running around doing stuff like talking to my dad and the other women, telling me whats going on constantly and wanting to talk, trying to go back to work the day after being in emergency.

I feel bad saying this, but I told her I'm done because all she does is blame me. Its been 20 years and shes following the same pattern where I get all the blame and become the blacksheep. Plus I found out she had been betraying my trust and giving my dad access to personal info like my address and pictures of my kid when I expressly asked her not to because I'm no contact (dad abused me too).

Am I a terrible person? Has anyone felt the same or can empathise?"
"I was abused by my parents, grandma, and family friends from childhood to adulthood. It was awful and painful experience. There are more details about what happened like I was told that you are stupid, nothing, and other negative words and actions. I didn’t even realized how fucked up until when I was older and went to therapy for that. It was not normal at all. It wasn’t my fault for what happened about it. Thank you so much for listening and texting with this. It means a lot to me. "
"To preface, two things:

1. I'm not suggesting this itself is abuse, I just think it's telling about his mindset.
2. The abuse I suffered was mostly emotional and verbal and definitely compared to some of the other people here much more mild. It still scarred me heavily though. But that doesn't mean I'm not aware that many people have experienced way worse.

Anyway, that out of the way... I was working with my father on something. And it made me start to notice something. He uses the word ""perfect"" more than anyone else I've ever known.

Like every time he would do something he would do it very carefully. And when he was finished he would talk about how it was perfect.

If I screwed up in any way, he would get angry and insult me. And at one point yelled at me that I can't do anything right when I briefly dropped a nail I was supposed to hand him.

I know that I, as a person, have kind of an obsession with doing everything perfectly. And being perfect, basically. I'm extremely perfectionist. It's one of the reasons I have body dysmorphia, because I can't stand being anything but beautiful. Anything less is not good enough. And it's part of why I have performance anxiety and struggled emotionally to get through college, because if I didn't get perfect grades I would hate myself and want to die.

And, you know, I guess I just see a connection between these two things. My father would constantly talk about ""perfection"" (using that word) and accept nothing less and yell at me or insult me if I screwed up in any way (sometimes for like an hour straight). And I can't accept being anything except perfect or doing anything not perfectly. And I feel deeply worthless inside most of the time.

I guess being obsessed with perfection is not so strange when your father is constantly talking about it and yells at you for anything less.

This might seem obvious, but I'm very much an adult and yet I only realized like a year ago exactly how much the guy uses that word. Or how it might have affected me. And now that I've started noticing it, I think about it every time he says it. Which is basically every time (multiple times) we work on anything together."
"We live in a very southern area, kind of in the middle of nowhere to be honest, and the only homeless shelter seems to not be an option for me.

My mom has gone back and forth a lot on whether or not she wants to kick me out, but right now I'm going into this with the belief that she probably will. She probably has undiagnosed BPD and/or NPD and cycles between abuse and love-bombing quite often. She outed me as queer to my grandparents (one of them watches far-right nazi content online and has made their opinions VERY clear) and I don't feel safe living with them 

I'm struggling mentally, and I've come to the conclusion that I probably have pretty severe OCD, although I don't feel safe telling my mom this, as opening up about anything mental illness related has caused me to be emotionally and physically abused in the past. I bring this up because social interaction is really fucking hard for me, and the thought of trying to find a roommate or a job kinda stresses me out, definitely more-so than it would with most people. I've also been depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed most of the day, which is seemingly furthering her resentment towards me.

I'm typing this on a back-up cellphone that my mom doesn't seem to know about. I have to keep this phone either under my pillow, my bed, or in one of my shoes to prevent her from finding it. She took my regular phone after finding out I was extensively researching abuse and housing options. She told me word for word that ""she knows I'm trying to escape, and she won't make it easy on me"". I have MAYBE 2 people who I could imagine staying with for a while, but it's realistically not very likely. Getting an online job or doing something of that sort just isn't possible, as my mom took the keyboard to my computer.

There's really no other family that I can think of, and I don't have very many friends nearby. I have around 250 bucks in my wallet at the moment but that's it. I had a job, but she made me quit because she didn't want to make it easy for me to ""escape"". She's mentioned me getting another job a few days ago, but I don't know when that would be. 

Again, I want to really clarify this. We live in a VERY southern town, with VERY few shelters or job opportunities. I also do not have a driver's license or any kind of way to really travel. Public transport isn't really a thing here.

Any kind of advice would be wonderful. I'll clarify anything in the comments if I need to.

EDIT - I have a ldr partner, and we do plan to move in together at some point, but that might not be for a while due to a variety of different reasons. "

"my mom has two kids (me 25NB and my sister 23F) and my aunt has one (19F). thing is theyre in their 50s and instead of doing a lot of things for themselves, theyll make us do it. esp for things like downloading things or for filing stuff. she’s been making me do this since i was a kid and only recently started w my sister. it pisses me off cus my aunt doesnt even rely on her kid even tho she can do it. and its even worse cus we live one block away from my aunt. my grandpa lives w her and they make us send him to the mosque by grab (the ride sharing app in sg) every friday even tho tbh she or my cousin could do it. its frustrating cus they act entitled to it and cant handle the fact that we might not want to. my mom is just. horrible and used to and still does lash out at us and expect us to know everything abt the forms/websites we have to help her with even tho we dont. ive been tired for so long bcus of this. and my mom lets my sister since young boss me ard too. to the pt where they make me take drinks for them like a maid even tho they can do it themselves. she yells at us when things dont go her way and expects us to be free labour. even tho she said we shd “focus on out studies, she’ll focus on housework” she would force us to clean w us and would lash out during it. she would slam plates and things ard and use the vacuum to shove things out of her way. to the pt where now im scared of vacuum sounds. it sucks and im so tired but they all mock me for being so tired. i sleep 12 hours a day now that im unemployed and it sucks even worse that they still rely on me a lot for things. and when i dont like my aunt or get upset at her my mom brings up the things she bought for us as kids and how she and her tbh always buy us crap we didnt ask for. i get its not super abusive, but they are manipulative and so. horrible. i get so tired living w them. i wish i was never born"
"I get told I'm 'defensive' constantly, for years. I get told I don't listen, and that I shut down.

But then, for example, my mom reads off the label of a supplement I'm supposed to be taking, and gets concerned that it'll interact with what I've already got. I try to assure her that I don't think my doctor would prescribe that to me if that was a major risk. (It's not, I just looked it up).

She reads off my regular meds' bottle anyway, and says ""this also causes fatigue""! Because she refuses to listen to me in general, but especially in regards to what's actually causing the disabilities that I have, one of the major ones being CFS. Even though I try to share information, videos, articles, infographics, etc. 

I meekly tell her that I don't think it's from that, that's all I say, but my reasoning is because I've been fatigued for over five years and just starting taking this medication last year.

And she just... storms out of the room, wordlessly. And it's not just the actions but how she does things... she's extremely cold and severe, and yet she's normal with my father, and he's the same way.

I just... I know this subreddit would understand better than any the feeling this causes, just being made to wonder if you're insane, or if you're actually acting out and being unreasonable. But I pack myself into a box just to try to appease my parents and try to reduce the emotional abuse.

Today was a really fucking horrible day. I'm having a mental episode that my mom dismissed as me just needing to eat and take supplements and drink water. 

If I try to express that I need more emotionally I get yelled at and told that they ARE emotionally supportive, and if I contest that, I get hit with the ""oh I guess we're awful parents then"" card. 

I screamed into my pillow today to try to feel better. I try talking to friends about it but what can they do? Why would they want to listen? "
"okay obviously i'm gonna hope this remains anonymous because he won't listen to me on talking to someone about getting help. but i wanna know if there's anything legal that can be done here because we've run out of options. i (19 f) have been dating my (19 m) boyfriend for about 9 months now and his mom has gotten worse throughout the course of our relationship. to sum things up as a whole (it's a lot): 1. anytime he has a job and makes his own money she comes up with any reason on why she doesn't like that job and forces him to quit; so he can't keep a job or make his own money.   

she's very very religious and forces him to go to church every sunday and also actively attempts to force him to join a youth group or else she says she'll kick him out. 

she makes him do all the household chores, (he basically cleans the whole house), pick up and drop off his siblings to and from school etc.
 he's in charge of making sure they've eaten and done their homework, and if any of his siblings get in trouble for doing anything, he's blamed for ""not being a good influence"" or ""not watching them good enough"" as if he's the parent in the house. 

she manipulates him and says HE'S manipulative and that all he does is take from her. 

she fat shames him and will sometimes tell him that he eats too much of their food as a ""grown man"" and that he's only allowed to eat dinner or food he's bought himself. (once again has no money because she makes him quit every job). and then she tells him that he's lazy and ""can't keep a job""

she's emotionally abusive, she always has to be the victim. she lies about him cursing and yelling at her which he never does. he's always calm. 

he had a good amount of money at one time that he was payed and she told him he had to put it in a savings account that only she has access to ""so he doesn't spend it all."" so he has no access to that money as of right now.

she kicks him out every few months for any reason she can find and leaves him to walk the streets alone at night, knowing that he has nowhere to go. (when he was a minor she'd kick him out, then report him to the police as a runaway).

she tells him that she doesn't think he should have a girlfriend and gets really upset anytime he spends times with me. 

she tells him that she doesn't care about him doing certain things but then when he does them, she'll turn around and scream at punish him. 

she got on him forever about how he was lazy because he wasn't in school (he graduated 2023) and then he got into college for film, in which he was excited to meet new people and make friends, and he went for ONE week before she made him switch to online so that he can be home to take care of his siblings and do chores.

she'll take his phone anytime she gets annoyed or mad while he's waiting for calls about interviews or calls from his counselor, causing him to miss important calls and lose opportunities on getting a job or doing good in school

and she's currently moving him into a way smaller room that he'll share with his brother that will BARELY fit both of them, so that her boyfriend and his kids can move in. and she's making him get rid of his computer because it won't fit. (the computer he does online college on???)

she tells him that she can't stand the sight of him or the sound of his voice. a specific example would be, there is one time he broke down and opened up to her about how harmful she's being and how she makes him feel helpless and she said ""my stomach started hurting when you got in here and it just got worse as you kept talking"" and said she couldn't stand him. 

and there's much much more. he's 19, might i add again. obviously legally he's an adult and can move out at any time he wants. but she LITERALLY makes it impossible for him to be able to get a car or keep a job in order to make money to leave. he can't live with me because i still live with my mom as well and won't be able to move out until im done with cosmetology school. is there a legal route we could take? like there's absolutely no way he can grow and be independent as an adult because she guilts and manipulates him into staying. i've run out of options on how to help him and he's reluctant to ask for outside help but i'm tired of seeing my boyfriend lose who he is and give up on life because of this abusive woman.

"my dad has a temper, and my mom puts people down. sometimes, when my dad is really mad, he gets physical. once, he pushed my 15 yr old sister and kicked her. tonight, he slammed her by her throat into a barn, then proceeded to throw her to the ground. he is 60, and a large man, so obv it hurt her. my parents say its discipline. my mother lets it happen, once throwing a brush at me, and telling all sorts of hurtful things like your fault, lose weight, be smarter, jus normal mother comments. but when we ask abt what my dad does, she said it is wrong, but it's just discipline. is she right?"
"
I live with my grandparents. My granddad keeps making very odd and sexual jokes towards me, and sometimes even touching me. It started off with him spanking me. I felt so disgusted that I cried and slapped him in the head out of anger. He immediately brushed it off, saying that what I did was overreacting. He doesn’t ever do it with anyone else. And about the sexual comments thing; today we were talking and he brought up not liking the body wash he was using, so I offered him some advice. My granddad then told me to just wash him while he wore a speedo. There were a lot more before this, including him joking about me getting pregnant. (I’m 15 btw). He also has a quick temper. My granddad grabbed my face, (I’m not over exaggerating this. He physically grabbed my face), pushing me backwards during a yelling match. I live with him so there isn’t much I can do."
"I’m about 13 weeks pregnant, when I told my mom, she immediately was overbearing saying that she wants to be a part of my very first ultrasound. I didn’t think that was appropriate and wanted that moment for my partner and I am 27 years old and I am pretty independent and make my own money. But the thing is, I sold my house about two years ago, and my parents offered for me to live in a house that was on a business property that they owned. They offered and I decided to take it and sell my house and save money regretting the situation. anytime I disagree with my parents. They immediately tried to say that they were going to kick me out and that I am ungrateful, I’m extremely grateful that they let me live here free but I also pay utilities and everything else that needs to be paid to live. But back to my ultrasound my mom flipped out and said that she doesn’t want to go anywhere she’s not wanted and made it about herself saying that my partner is manipulating me, trying to cut her out, which is not the case is it is the complete opposite it was my decision and I offered for her to come to the next one and she started saying very emotionally abusive things like saying that she’s already experienced being a grandmother. Mind you she isn’t actually a grandmother. We’ve had a couple close friends have babies that she was a part of, but they also didn’t have supportive baby daddy, my partner is the best partner through thick and thin. My partner parents are amazing and are really great people and I’m pretty close with his mom. She stopped by the house the other day to bring food and she stopped and talked to my dad saying that she’s excited for the baby and she can help with the baby whenever, when I approached my dad and asked what they talked about, he went insane. He’s jealous that I have a relationship with his mom and not mine. He was so aggressive. I thought he was going to try and attack my partner, and I had to threaten to call the police. I was hysterical hyperventilating because how severe the situation was. my parents think that I am the problem and spoiled and I’m completely in the wrong about the situation. It’s like they think my child is prize possession and just because I live in a house that they let me live in that they can treat me, however, and I have to accept it. It’s causing me severe distress and a lot of trauma of being emotionally abused my entire life. My lease is up in June and my partner, and I are trying to find a place to live. But at this point, I’ve threatened to get a restraining order if they come near me it’s crazy to me that they know I’m pregnant and can’t be under all this emotional distress. They are convinced that I am the problem.

"I'm a 24F living and coming from a middle eastern family, i left home Dec 2022 against my will because i was beaten until bled by my abusive parents and sent to the ER and was hospitalized for days, they didn't visit ofc and i didnt want them to, police were involved and they made my parents sign a report but thats all. Keep in mind this is because they found out i had a boyfriend. 

anyways i left and built a life from 0, i work and study full time now it's so hard, i pay rent and dont have a car. but would rather do that than go back. 

 they r west asians meaning super strict religious and even abusive parents, ever since i left, they would threaten me with hiring someone to follow me, or threaten to sue me or even k!ll me, i never believed them bc i know it's a tactic, i get this info from my siblings and it's draining, these threats throw me off course every time, bad anxiety, panicking, depression for days, even if i know they cant do it, it always affects me. 

sometimes they try to be nice and send money which is also a tactic, my sisters wedding is soon, and they r scared of our relatives finding out why im never on these events/gatherings. 

they offered me a car then days later threatened to sue me????? 

Anyways how do i stop getting affected and thrown out of balance everytime they play these games "

"I am in desperate need to figure out a different living situation! I have my dog with me. I have approximately 1 week mandatory I have to stay here. My dog gave birth to a litter of 9 nearly 7 weeks ago. I have been taking care of them the whole time, whole my mom complains about the smell and the mess. I was apathetic to her complaints, because it's 9 diaper-less babies, which I did my best to contain to my room and backyard. My mom has been fighting everyone in the house for 2 weeks. Last Friday in order to get revenge on her boyfriend for being mad at her for cheating, she beat his dog to near death, and now we can't find him. That dog has 2 charms with a vet number, and his number, neither have been called in a week, and no pictures on the neighborhood website. He has ""escaped"" multiple times before, but he's usually found fast. I am just now discovering that she also poisoned the litter of 9 puppies because she was mad at me for existing. I came home after work and that made her mad because she didn't want me home. She also says that maybe her house might actually be clean for once when they all die. Which scares me because me and my brother both have our dogs. She wouldn't hurt my brother's dog, he's always on her side. Once I rehome all the puppies, assuming they all live, I need to leave. 

I currently make about $450/mo, I have bipolar and this hurts my job reliability. The job I have now is the longest career I have ever kept, and it's because they are super flexible and understanding. I might get a bit more hours and raise this summer but not a lot. Also my mom ruined my credit with her stupid hearing aids. I was there when we signed for them, I can't sue her, but the hearing aids are in my name. I was 18, and just trying to help my mom out, and was proud of my near perfect credit score, but then she only made 1 single payment. I have been doing my best to pay them back, I'm 22 now, but they're expensive. Other than that I have OCD and asd. That pretty much sums up my whole situation and how I still live with my mom. I have a friend to roommate with mid summer, I need advice most particularly between them.

Please, give me the best advice you can! I might be able to roommate with my friend mid summer, a couple months away, but until then I welcome advice.
THANK YOU in advice 

*ps. If I ask questions, or explain why something won't work, I'm not trying to be dismissive, I am trying to find the best suitable option. Ideally, your advice is noted but needs to be worked out for my more specific situation. "

"Hello everyone and by the title you can probably tell my family members are basically just shit waiting to be picked up by the garbage truck. The main perpetrator in my family is one and behold my father and his WHOLE family, yes the entire family is just passed down assholes and the only thing they're leaving behind is their shitty personalities and raising their kids as the same. Now what did my dad do? Everything, gaslight, physically abuse, mentally abuse, degrade, and suck your blood dry till you can't feel a single sense of happiness anymore. To add to that when I smile I feel as if it's fake, anything that makes me even a tad bit happy I start to question it. I have 2 older sisters and a mom which I feel terrible for but is somehow day by day turning more paranoid and is picking up some of my dads abusive personality traits. My dad is a weight that I can't get rid of, he's the type that  plays with your head and won't leave you alone till the day you die like a parasite. He hits my mother, he hits all of us basically and blames it on the fact that he's a man and when he gets tempered his blood boils and has this masculine energy burst to either choke or slap you and then gaslight you into thinking you messed up. Exactly and yes I want to push him off a cliff just as much as you want to. Omg you won't believe it there's another perpetrator, tens of them :)  The biggest one of them all is my dad's father aka my grandpa who I want to skin to death!! Yes he's another alpha male wannabe, and so are his other sons and his daughters that are like the worst people on this planet. What did my grandpa do? Gaslight my mom into kissing my dads feet and be the little cutesy housewife who would NEVER dare to raise her voice even when he husband is being a bitch. I'm going to end it here if this post goes well I'll go into the real drama because the things my dad says would never fail to make everyone's jaw drop! :) love yall  "
"so, my mother has been bitching at me about getting a job, even though i could've had one when i was in school, but she refused to let me. She told me she would throw me out with nothing, and threatened to take my door off, threatened me with assault, and has actually assaulted me, and hurt me. She also guilt trips people to make them take her side, and constantly moans and groans about everything. Any advice on what i can do?"

for example i said i wanted to drive then the cunt said no you can not use my car and me and my brother will misbehave but i would be the one abused verbally and physically but my brother would only get told off lmao whats this called
"I am currently living with my (former) abusive father-I bet he's not abusive anymore just because now he's older and knows nobody's gonna take care of him. He used to beat up my mum just enough to give me and her permanent scars but so it isn't visible if she put on makeup. My whole childhood I was in fear coming home to my mum being dead (great imagination). When I was 17, I had to study for exams everyday while my father was in a mental institution cause that is how he always escaped prison. I still live with my parents, and currently I am not talking with my father because all of the trauma has built up over the years and because he always blackmails me (I don't have my own car currently so everytime we fight he says I can't drive his car). I don't have problems with not talking because I resent him so much, but I am always worried about my mum and how her life is going to be once I move out. I know that is not my fault and I shouldn't worry, but over the years my mum became so important to me. What to do? What do you think about this shitty situation? How can I stop worry and take control of my feelings once I move out? Thank you all so much for reading."
My mom is emotionally abusive and controlling I finally came clean about the fraud she committed and it has resulted in 95% of my family not talking to me especially my sister and my cousin who is my best friend I don’t know what to do at this point. 
"Hi everyone! These last few weeks have been a real eye opener to my mother’s manipulation. 

I grew up in with a very abusive (emotionally and physically) mother and a father who did nothing to stop it. We came from Mexico when my mom married my father and he adopted us, so up until a few years ago, I always have carried this idea that my father was my hero because he rescued us. On the flip side, my mother has always been the devil. She would constantly yell at us saying we weren’t good enough, we were shitty kids and that we should be embarrassed because we were wastes of money and time. 

At one point growing up, my little brother told his teacher about my mom hitting us and CPS got involved but nothing came of it because my parents coached us on what to say and because my dad had a great and upstanding career in the military, it went nowhere. 

I vividly remember my mother dragging my little brother to the tub and holding his head under the water. My psych eventually reframed that as attempted murder and my mind was blown. Anyway, there are so many other stories about how she would hit us, degrade us, and isolated us from all the family we had in Mexico and I always believed it was my fault. She even slapped me in the face when I was 9m pregnant with my son because I wouldn’t turn the heat up and she was cold. Funny enough, my water broke after an argument with her that day.

I’ve been in therapy since 2014, and it’s made SUCH a difference. She was so kind and understanding and helped me process so much. First: none of this was my fault. While it seems so easy and obvious, that’s something I have to tell myself everyday. Second: my father is no white knight. Whenever my mom would start hitting me, I’d run behind him for protection but he wouldn’t do anything, he’d just sit there and keep reading the newspaper. He only cared about our grades, accolades, and what sports we were doing. Three: my mom has BPD. This was probably the biggest nugget because her behavior was a text book example. The whole, I love you, I hate you, you’re not going anywhere. 

Anyway, fast forward to now: contact with them is very limited, and the only reason my mom reached out this year is because she needed help with her homework…and by that, she wanted me to do it. Well, I set my foot down two weeks ago, and I told my dad that if she needed this much help, she needed a tutor or switch majors. He said alright, and I have not heard from them since.

I’m sorry if it’s all over the place, I’ve just never written all of this out and it opens up a lot of wounds. I have 3 wonderful children and a loving husband, and I literally wouldn’t even dream of treating my kids the way my mother did to me. They are loved, nurtured, safe and secure ❤️"
"My dad was incredibly abusive to me ant my mom. He wasn't always that way. He used to be kind and I used to be excited to see him home from work when I was a kid. That kind man died when I was 14 or 16 when he turned into an alcoholic and opiate addict... or rather, got back into his old habits from before I was even born.   He became verbally and physically abusive. He was even abusive to me after a drunk driver nearly killed me, saying it was my fault and I never should have been out that late. He stole my Hydrocodone while I was bedbound and was in extreme pain from a displaced sternum and multiple other injuries. That was when I decided that I hated him. 

After I recovered and got a good paying job, a small inheritance from my grandfather,  i moved out. Shortly thereafter he received a pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis and began to decline and he became more reserved and subdued. Especially after the double lung transplant. 2 years later, he died of a stroke or heart attack from a blood clot. He never apologized. He never attempted to reconcile even though I branched out to him.

 This was recent and I felt like I haven't been mourning his loss because I already did so long ago. 

However, I've been having dreams. It's how I remember him looking from before he was sick, and before he began to abuse substances. I'll feel the excitement that my dad's home and we'll eat zebra cakes, play cards or chess together, and go fishing in the morning,  or build a computer together. I actually smiled and sat by him. 

I woke up crying. I hate that he died the man he became and we were never able to reconcile... I miss the man he was before substance abuse. "
"Ok so I (18f) was adopted with my twin brother when we were little like 16 months, into a super religious household with a older sister. The encouraged sibling rivalry was also insane growing up, my parents literally pitted up against each other and shit. Got pissed whenever we switched on each other, but got suspicious and accusative whenever we didn't. Then 3 years later comes my little sis, I think she was like some sort of miracle baby or sum cuz of how much they (my parents) baby her. She's got one of the worst cases of spoiled sibling baby of the family entitlement shit u've ever seen. My parents never treated me and my brother the same. Little sis constantly got shit that me and my brother didn't, she got all the awesome birthdays and gifts, while my brother and I got cast offs. Literally. My, what was, favorite gift for Christmas of a MP3 player turned out to be a promo addition of one of my sister's gifts. It really broke me finding that out. But I always found shit out, the minute I shut up, I became invisible, so I used to my advantage, cuz around there, u talked to much u pissed dad off and got hit, it got better throughout the years after my older sis reported him to CPS, but I was too young and afraid of my father to speak out against him. Maybe if I had, we would have been able to escape that house, all of us. But none of us said she so she was written off as a troublemaker and nothing happened, my dad always had the saying that ""it was good that we were scared of him, maybe that way we wouldn't disobey him"" as I got older I started to realize that shit wasn't normal there, but every time I tried to get CPS involved, nobody said anything against him. So I was was written off as an attention seeking troublemaker. So instead I gave up and just ranted to my friends instead. In order to protect my siblings i would act out to keep dads attention on me, so he would hit me the most. I just recently moved out, now I'm living with my bf, and my ""dad"" is shunning me until I stop ""living in sin"". Coming up is the end of the school year in which one of my favorite cousins always throws a party,  I'm worried they might misconstruct everything and make me out to be the bad guy, so do I let them all know before they have the chance? (P.S. this is just the parental abuse, not to mention the torture my little sister put me through that my parents didn't give a fuck about or my brother literally trying to kill me multiple time and then telling people I tried to kill him)"
"I got out of my adoptive parents grasp after they tried to get me to break up with my fiance at 26, saying I needed to focus on family and my ""responsibilities"" I wasn't allowed to drive, date or even have friends loving with them. It got physical and I got a Domestic Violence Protection order against her. I got out and that was in November.
I am now living with my fiancé, I have a car, our own apartment, even my dream dog (a corgi), he works while I stay home and he provides everything. 
I couldn't have had these experiences staying with that family as I was paying her 800 in rent while also spending 300 every month on her animals as well as using credit cards on HER animals and I had to pay on them too. 
I'm so glad I got out. If anyone has any similar situations let me know."
My mother  beat me in the shower a few times growing up. Once or twice out of no where . Sometimes with a broom stick. Once with the shower head. It wasn't an everyday day things and tbh I thought all kids were getting whooped just like me and that I was depressed because somthing was wrong with me. Did anybody else ever deal with things like that growing up?
"I've moved before, but both times, it was a pyrrhic victory at best, because I had to end up moving back, and I ended up being miserable with my new living situation. This time, I have to keep paying her back for the car on top of paying for rent at my new place and whatever other essentials. Hopefully, I can land a job that'll pay me well enough to balance everything out, but I'm still not used to this notion of freedom. I've caught myself wanting to feel loved — truly loved — by her, which I thought I'd long ago given up on."
"I don’t exactly know how to do this but I definitely don’t want to talk to my family as if they act like their mine. I’m a young adult in a Indian household so if you get the gist they are strict and religious I’m the older f 21 and I realize or more or less came to terms with the fact my family hates me and does not prioritize me at all let alone love me. 

Any sort of problem I have with them resulting my life with boyfriends wanting to be my own person could never happened i today started talking about an issue with my parents about how I need a new laptop where it just does not fiction and I called it cheap and old and I tried everything in my power to make this shitty hp laptop last name it I tried it. My mom spirals to say you don’t have a job if you saved your money you could have gotten one then my dad chimes in to say how stupid and every name of the book I can think of for the lack of Intel ago ve I have but lastly my younger sister in uni shits on me too because the conversation somehow involved her when she did not need to put in her two cents. And it got all the way to the point where every end conversation is why don’t I ever buy my self all the important stuff and why am I not prepared to buy my own necessities. 

I thought it be fine to ask my parents for a laptop since they got my sister one bit too long ago not ti mention a lily lemon bag and they shit on me for not paying my own bus fares or for my computer because I’m an adult who should have money which I get but I got let go from my job because they still blame me otherwise all the way too saying how the rent money she charges me was to help me and my spending habits and not to help them even though that what they told me at the beginning.

This over all ended to my mom having an ego trip saying that there are more people that pay more and go to school and I have a month too move out and I have a month too get a job or move out. I know this sorry doesn’t make sense and I’m sounding all over the place but I worked country sleepless nights this weeks to prioritize my school so I could pass my first semester. They always said if I have issues to come to them for help but all I got was shit on and there’s even worse causes with my parents and my space or me dealing with boys and all I can do right now is not help but cry and wish to have a fiend that understands me or like advice but I think the number one thing I was is for a family that cares about me and or loves me enough not to insult me and which me luck for school or to value how my day is and not give me shitty a five to tell me how stupid I am maybe I’ll find love somewhere one day but m it with my family or with a partner man I want a hug rn anyway to anyone that gone this far to read this thanks for hearing me out I hope y’all have a nice day ."
"(TW mentions of suicide and threats) I’m usually left alone while my mom goes to school but im always too depressed to get out of bed every-time I hear the door open when she gets home I get hit with dread because I know she is going to immediately start to complain about how the place is a mess and if I defend myself I am always bombarded with insults, and if we get into a argument she threatens to leave me harm me or tells me to get out of her house (I’m 16), she knows I am severely depressed and while writing this she has told me that she hates me and that she wished I succeeded in my suicide attempt back in 2020, and every-time I call her out she denies it and tells me that I do that to her and how I make her life miserable, she has told me multiple times to go to hell and has straight up told me to kms. The house is extremely nasty and borderline infested with roaches and she blames it all on me. I don’t want to call her abusive but at this point I don’t think I can think her actions are just stress related anymore im unsure if my post will be taken down though I didn’t see anything in the rules about it, but I just want an answer I feel like I’m being gaslighted."

Hii! I was told to post here. Thanks for noticing my thread. :)
I’m sorry if this is a wrong place to post this ;w;

[tw:   child abuse, fraud, self harm, sexual harassment]

𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝: I grew up in Malaysia and attended college there before they made me drop out and migrated me to Indonesia, their home country. I am working an online part-time job as a teacher to save up. My parents and extended family has always been controlling about small and big things, from the colour of clothes I wear daily (they’re not skimpy at all) to trying to put a wedge between my friends, my exes and my current s.o. Even my boss, for insisting that he wires my salary to me. When they knew they couldn’t coax the boss, they wrote a letter impersonating me and forged my signature. They cut me off of people they can’t control basically. I believe they care about me and want to stop me from dangerous people, and yet they blamed me when a guy they were shipping me with and another teacher tried to sexually harass me, and told me I was lucky that some people, relatives whatsoever, like to fondle with my thighs and my ass. They constantly blame the people in my life for ruining our family relationship and label my friends and s.o. as “manipulative”. It was hard to see as the abuse was mostly emotional. There were instances of physical violence too -grabbing my wrist and spraining it and bruising my thigh- I don’t know if it was intentional…. nevertheless, I was going down the deep end, self harming daily, sometimes several times a day, and close to deleting myself from life.

𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: I’m turning 18 this November and I’ve been planning to move out since the first year of highschool, and I’ve worked a stable online teaching part-time job. I have recently created my own bank account and have a decent amount of money saved. It isn’t as much as I initially expected because my parents confiscated my year-worth of salary. Another finance worry aside from college, I researched but I have no idea how insurance and taxes work. 

I am uneasy because they are forcing me to resign once I start college in Indonesia in September. My boss was understanding and we previously discussed about having me on leave until I can stably move out and continue my job. I’m still worried that things will go wrong and I end up moving out with nowhere to go. I looked up housings and asked a friend’s mom whose job is a housing agent and found out I need my Identification card to rent a house / room. However, I can’t physically survey them yet since they have me locked in the house, only going out for church with their tight supervision. I’m still thinking if I need to relocate to a different city in case my family ends up finding me… the thought of what they’ll do terrifies me.

It will be in the first semester of college when I move out, hence, there’s a chance I’ll be in the dorms during the weekdays. I just gotta have my identifications with me, either by sneaking it out when I visit home for birthday, or with a civil standby. Currently, I have my Identification card with me. My birth certificate, high schools  graduate certification, and passports are withheld but I know the location, provided they don’t move it. I found out from my Indonesian friend that I can phone the cops to come as a civil standby in case any violence happens.

___
and I always loved my family and thus I’ve tried reasoning a lot with myself, asking if I’m just being a bad daughter? That maybe if I studied more and get that A* and not just an A or B, or if I am a bit more perfect like they asked of me, they’d love me as I am? I guess my parents thought they were right as they mentioned they were raised that way too. I hate to admit it but I feel guilty moving out since my parents and extended family are now unemployed. Of course there were happy glimpse, but lots of things they did and are doing doesn’t sit right and I feel like I’m about to lose it everyday. Many told me to get out and not look back, and I came to terms that it’s for the best. It’s still one scary thing to think about though :(

𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐝, 𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞~: Thus, if I may, I’m asking:
1. advice about successfully moving out in Indonesia; opinions from any countries are appreciated too! 
2. what are the things that could go wrong and I should watch out for.
3. any other thoughts / your story that you wanna share :3

If you’re still here, thank you for staying and reading my lengthy blog, and may heavens bless you with a cute kitten / puppy / any animal you like. Take care~ •w•"
"so my previously abusive family are now helping me our with my daughter (5months) because im doing it solo right now. i moved back in with my dad about a year ago a couple months after i found out i was pregnant. 
lately, there has been some discussion about my independency which i find odd because i left home in 2020 and barely came back until last year because of the toxicity. it wasn't until i literally ran out of the house with my belongings, that the family decided to take what i have to say seriously (i was usually the scapegoat). anyways, i find it hilarious when my dad or sister or anyone else tries to insinuate i don't know how to be independent (aka never asking for help and choosing to struggle when there are better options which is such a heavy heavy poverty and lack mindset imo). call it entitlement but i think they should think to themselves how shitty they were to me growing up, and be thankful i have chose to let the pain go and not seek revenge or pettiness 😂😂 
anyways, i am grateful for them slowly changing their ways. im using the abuse i faced as a catalyst for a better life for me and my LO. "
"Up until a few weeks ago, I thought my only real parental problems were with my biological father, who was physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my brother until he cut me off on my 13th birthday for being gay. Now, here I am, eight years after losing one shitty parent, having to make the choice to cut off the other. 

My mom's an alcoholic. She started drinking heavily when I was in middle school. She went to rehab, and she really seemed like she got better. She relapsed for the first time when I was just starting high school. She relapsed for the second time when I was about to graduate high school. She relapsed for the third time three weeks ago. Shockingly, the alcoholism is far from the main reason I have for cutting her off, but it's what made me realize a pattern of behavior for her. 

My mom is a very selfish, narcissistic woman. I love her, I do, but everything, my whole life, has always been about her, or about my brother, her favorite child. I have no ill will towards my brother, he's one of my best friends. He had a lot of open struggles with mental illness growing up, and all of my mom's (however performative) support was focused on the child who ""needed it."" I've always been the easy kid, the quiet one, the responsible, well adjusted, mature one. I learned from a really young age that trying to talk about my struggles wouldn't do anything anyways. It would always turn into my mom crying about being a horrible mother and a failure of a parent because how could she have *two* depressed children? 

She called me, the other week, at 3:30pm on a work day. I work evenings, so I was only about two hours into my shift. She decided that was the perfect time to drop the bomb that she relapsed. The whole phonecall was full of her saying ""*I* wanted"", ""*I* needed"", ""*I* felt."" Not caring that I was at work, not caring at all how this would make me feel to hear, knowing that I'd have to go back to work and pretend everything is fine for six more hours. It made me realize she never really cared, at all. As long as it was what she wanted, what she needed, how it made me feel never mattered. I haven't spoken to her since that phone call. 

Now I'm sitting here, at what is currently 2:31am on a work night, sick to my stomach from crying all day, thinking how much easier it all would've been for everyone if I wasn't born at all. Never seemed to make much of a difference to my parents. At least I've got my aunt and my stepdad. Sorry for the novel, feeling a lot of things right now. "
"Since I'm seeing so many posts in rant-format, I'll try to keep this short.

Girlfriend is 42. Her mother is mid 60's, from what I can tell she is a clinical narcissist and possibly bipolar. She forced her way into living with my girlfriend as she has nowhere to go and burned all her bridges. Raised to believe everything goes her way, she says absolutely horrible things to my girlfriend and will not take any kind of criticism. I could go on and on about the crazy. 

The tricky part, she says ""I'm not going anywhere I will live here if I want and you can't tell me otherwise"" in spanish but it's going to bring my girlfriend to s***ide. My emails to social services requesting advice go unanswered. I don't know what our options or resources are. There's no family or friends that would take her and she's not going anywhere without a fight. My girlfriends kids hide in their rooms 24/7 because she is so unbearable. 

What in the world can I even do? I have no idea where to turn. "
"TW sibling r*pe.
 I escaped my parents at 16 because my mother’s son (he does not deserve the b word) Rred me for several years. I lived for a decade at my grandparents until in late 2016 early 2017, I had a breakdown. I contacted the NSPCC because I was scared my Rist would have access to children. They called the rozzer’s and I had to write my parents a letter explaining everything. They did not take it well. My mother especially called me a liar and says I traumatised him with the cops. I’ve managed to explain to my dad that I’m Pan and Non Binary and he understands but he’s still married to mother. She’s manipulated me for years; when I lived with her when she was drunk (which was every night) if we didn’t bow down to her she’d pretend to run away (she’d drive the car around the corner) but she drove drunk. She said if we didn’t eat the mountain of food on our plates she would never cook for us again. I’ve tried going No contact but she finds a way to bash in. My relationship with my Dad is getting better but my mother is a toxic psychopath along with her son"
"Hello, I just don’t know what to do. My mom’s being shouting at me since afternoon. She saw a vid in my phone of ke vaping. I do not vape/smoke or anything.

"A rather random question, I guess, but I find it interesting: Has the abuse you experience affected at all what media you consume? Like what kind of music, what kind of movies, what kind of video games, etc.?

For me I think it has very much predisposed me to enjoying heavy, moody and emotional music like Breaking Benjamin, Evanescence and Linkin Park.

And for like TV-series, video games, again, I think it has predisposed me to heavily emotional, darker, etc. stuff.

Like two of my favourite video games are ""Halo: CE"" and ""Bioshock Infinite.""

That first one may seem a little bit odd to people who don't know much about Halo because it's a shooter, not exactly a super emotional personal story. But the thing about it is that Halo really deals with being isolated on this mysterious ring, in a completely unwinnable and hopeless fight and fighting on anyway in the face of hopelessness and isolation. And I think that really resonates with me.

And then Bioshock Infinite, without talking about spoilers, I'd say it has one of the most emotional and one of the darkest relationship between two main characters out there.

So, yeah, I think the abuse tends to have made my taste in media very emotional, very dramatic, very dark and very much aimed at stuff like isolation, connection, hope and hopelessness, etc."
"Do I need to forgive my mom if she is verbally & physically abusive towards my dad ? I guess blood is thicker than water , so I want to forgive & go back to having a  relationship with her.  I also keep thinking I am not a perfect human & I've my share of hurting others so why not forgive another human   
 I also can't help but keep going back to the question how I'd have reacted if the genders were reversed  in the abuse ? I'm at my mid point in life 33.5 years, its emotionally draining tbh."
"AITAH?
ok, so my husband knows this person (we will call her Karen) well Karen was in a relationship with the father of her two children for 14+ yrs. About 6 months ago she left him over him Abusing their son whom is 14. I told her I'd help her however we could but that I'm on SSI and financially I'm not able to do alot. Well move along to the 1st of April. She knows I have trouble saying no to people due to childhood trauma and past DV issues with exes (reason I wanted to help her in the first place) well this girl orders $80+ at one fast food place and $50+ at another ON MY CARD and GRABS MY CARD AND HANDS IT TO THE PERSON IN THE WINDOW BEFORE I CAN SPEAK 😭 She then proceeded to put $35 in her gas tank and spent money in the gas station on whatever too😭 knowing I have fears of getting hurt for saying no. Well, I decided to try standing up for myself for once and she goes crazy on me and even has the nerve to say she's not paying me back and if I tell anyone they won't believe me, she called me out of my name (here's the kicker that really hurt) and sent a photo of her with the man that has abused her son for 11+ years. I am worried about the kids at this point and don't think they're safe. Was I wrong to call CPS and notify them there was RECENTLY a protective order against the father, the son testified in court about the abuse, and now Karen is allowing father around them? I'm honestly concerned because the man is violent and destroyed the last home they were in like DESTROYED it and she still let him back around the kids. She said if I reported it that she would press charges on me. She also said that if I said anything about the situation no one would believe me because I'm the R word (I'm autistic and fully disabled) "
"This is a long shot, but looking for someone who maybe has had a similar experience and can help…
About a year ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He is very active and the energy draining medication he was on and the impact it had on his ability to be active took a big hit to his mental health. 
My dad has always had issues with mental health (anger management, narcissism, depression), but he was a fairly well-liked, functional member of society. Flash forward to one year later, he’s been in prison twice now for stalking my mother (she left him after 6 months of giving up everything to try and help his mental health and sacrificing hers in the process, including when he pushed her down the stairs and threatened to hit her with a baseball bat), he’s destroyed our family home (broken all the windows, destroyed all the photo albums), he’s lost all his friends and family (the last time I talked to him was three months ago after he called me on repeat for three hours straight resulting in me having 145 missed calls from him).
Can someone please tell me what could have caused this? And if there is anything we can do? I’ve lost all hope my dad will ever get better and I assume he will be homeless soon. 
Thanks"
"So I live in an abusive household, nothing has ever been fixed, when I tried getting help the cps case worker said they understood because I’m special needs and I’m lying. But it has been an issue with my older sister too, but my older sister isn’t special needs. And nobody will believe me, because I lie sometimes but not about my home situation. My mom threatens me all the time, the cops have been called multiple times and everyone I went to church with doesn’t like her and knows she’s abusive. 

But she wanted to choke me because I laughed when she was yelling at me, and I know she has enough power to end my life, she’s mean and abusive and she always calls me worthless and so on. "
"for context i (22f) live with my mom and my stepdad. i’ve always had a good-ish relationship with both of them, but i’m finding a pattern of my mother going into what i call “episodes” where she doesn’t consult anyone and buys/sells something that effects all of us. this pattern has been with compulsively buying a dog (we have three now, i love all of them) but goes out of town a lot so i have to take care of them. one day i came home from school and saw my car had been sold by her, and she said that i can just use hers (which i do). and now it’s buying a new home, we moved during covid so i changed what college i was going to. there has been many other things but now we’re moving again apparently, and i am in my final year of college, i am a education student so where i was placed for my student teaching will now have to be changed, and i will need to find a new job when the one i have right now is perfect for me and my career. is this abuse? am i overreacting for being upset with her ? i tell myself i should be grateful that i am able to live with my parents rent free while i focus on school, but this is causing an extra stressor because now i’m looking to move out, but with student teaching that will be my full time job (unpaid, appreciate you’re teachers!) so i don’t know how i will be able to afford to live on my own.

"I moved across the country from my parents, my roommate are great, i’m doing okay with school and work.

"Exactly as the title says. I'm using an anonymous account, because I am too ashamed.

I'm living with my parents, and they (especially my mother) believe I'm not able to fend for myself, and be a top student like many of mine or my family's acquaintances. She is forcing my study schedule, she is forcing me to study for the exams I haven't passed from last year, even though I have to study for the upcoming finals as well. She always comes into my room under different pretexts, when I ask her why, she says it's her right. My dad agrees with her, at times. 

A few days ago, she also checked out my Whatsapp messages when I showed her some proof for enlisting in some workshop event organized by my college. My phone is secured, fingerprint and all that, yet she broke my privacy at first opportunity. She even had the audacity to tell me that my phone shouldn't be secured, and my dad agreed with her. She saw that I was contacted by a scammer, to which I haven't replied, but she started getting insane anyways. She has also forced me to install a family locator app (Life360 to be exact) when I was in senior year of HS, because she thought I wasn't going to take my graduation exam, but she also uses the excuse that ""she could see me when I am in trouble"" and her colleagues are using it for their children (one of them saved her daughter from being r\*ped).  She compares herself to her boisterous colleagues almost every day, and she wishes she could praise me as much as they do with their teenage or college-aged offsprings (and that includes former classmates of mine from HS or middle school, present-day colleagues from uni, and even my cousins!). It doesn't help that when I went yesterday for a lab, I did the most idiotic things, that only a person in need of psychiatric help would do.

They both think I'm mentally ill, and bringing them shame due to my failures. They also think I'm a burden, they generally treat me worse than a kid, including the time when I was an *actual* kid. They haven't beaten me at all (or very rarely) when I was that age, especially with the belt. But she started doing it a few months ago, and now I have trauma and flashing images whenever I see a belt 

The first thought would be ""why am I not leaving from their house?"". Well, in order for me to be accepted into a dorm, I'd have to live in an area that is not under the immediate conscription of my city (which is impossible since I'm living in the city itself), and I can't get a job because of my college schedule, so no rent for me either. I wanted to leave to another city/another country when I graduated from HS, but didn't have the money and the grades (it's still a frustration to this day, I wanted to leave for other reasons as well, besides my family).

"How has your parents’ abuse affected your academic performance?

I remember when I was 14 and my parents split, they were screaming and offending each other the entire day. My father was keeping us awake for an entire week, police came several times, he said he was gonna kill himself, he was screaming all night and terrorizing us until the police was called at the end after he started threatening to murder my mom in the middle of the night. He moved to another country afterwards. I had to miss an entire school week because I was too exhausted and scared to sleep during all of this. When I got back to school, I got screamed at by my teacher who accused me to skip school and being “irresponsible and childish”. My mother and her entire family told me to not say anything related to their divorce at school, so I kept my mouth shut.

Years have passed since then and I am attending a new school now since last year. But more recently, I can’t focus at all, I have constant brain fog. Each time I hear the voice of my abusive and neglectful mother, it kills every thought that was forming in my head. Hearing her is always bad news. The only reasons she talks to me are to either complain or scream and guilt trip me over everything. Sometimes, she starts fights out of nowhere and starts screaming at me (I usually just break down and try not to cry because I can’t handle people screaming). It takes so much time and effort that I can’t even manage to properly do my homework sometimes.

Also, I just recently came the realisation that I have several traumas, which for some reason are coming to the surface right now and are impacting me pretty badly. Most of them are because of my “great” upbringing (seriously, my mom brags about her parenting skills and even goes into detail to explain why they are superior). I can’t even manage to get therapy. I am still having a rough time, I feel completely empty, even though I am trying to distract myself from my inner state.

Recently, I got back my math exam, and I was devastated. I used to be an A student up until 2 months ago, and now I am afraid if I am gonna get a failing grade. My teacher showed dissapointment, he told me that “I could do better” and that “It is a pity”. Teachers’ opinions matter a lot to me, so it hit me like a rock. I am actually still debating with myself if I should at least tell him that I am having problems outside of school which impacted my performance recently, while also offering him to do some extra work.

"Long story short my parents tried to claim that the abuse (SA physical emotional) was a result of our Norwegian culture.  They go on to say they provided for us giving us everything we actually needed just as God has. 

When they were initially confronted they adamantly denied any of the abuse whatsoever fell back on religion telling us that were horrible Christian’s and going straight to hell if we don’t forgive and repent. They’ve since admitted to lesser instances of the actual abuse that took place yet they still think that they are somehow next to god and use religion to manipulate their adult children. 

Religion is solely a tool for them to justify their abuse and is the reason I can’t step foot in a church today"

"Over time I've realized there's a deep hollowness inside of me. A darkness that swallows everything up. A hurt that never truly goes away, it can only be treated (and that's only when I find someone I'm in romantic love with who seems to love me back).

I can't be sure where this hollowness comes from. But I suspect it's due to my parents' emotional abuse.

To be clear, the abuse I experienced is actually pretty tame compared to a lot of other people here have experienced, I think. I still sometimes question myself on whether I should call it abuse at all. But based on the articles I've read about the topic, it seems that it probably was.

Anyway, I guess I'm asking about: How many of you feel the same way? Where there's like an underlying pain or hollowness that you can't ever quite get rid of. You can only find ways to temporarily soothe it."

"I had been getting abused by my dads ex wife
Here is some back story my mom had me when she was 17 my dad was not a good person he kept a guy under his pillow at night when I was a baby, he also has threatened my life and hers then my grandparents got us away from him. My mom got on drugs and she had split custody with my dad and his now ex wife. I ended up getting put into dcf custody at the age of 6 I think and then put me with this family for a couple days, then I was put with my dads mom she put me in school I don’t remember what happened during that time except when I ran away from school and I was saying how I wanted to hurt myself and others I was 9 at this time so I went to a mental hospital I don’t remember how long I was there but when I got out then put me in a group home for troubled kids I was there for a while. After that I was put in a foster home which I really liked. Then I went to live with my dad and his now ex wife I was living with then for a while then my dad got onto drugs and was abusive to her so she divorced him and she got custody of me and my 2 younger brothers when we started to grow up I was getting treated differently then my brothers I would get into trouble for the littlest things and be grounded for months and they would do worse things then me and be grounded for a hour at most and everything went downhill from there she would leave bruises on my arms and throw things at me and she put me back into the mental health for 4 weeks and I kept saying I didn’t want to go back because I knew it would be worse and it was. She ended up getting a boyfriend who has a kid and she treated him better than she treated me even after they broke up. I have been kicked out of there because I called the cops on her for her abuse.

"Is it normal for you to get punished by your parents over some things(that might be little) ?
(Sorry if my grammar is bad, English is not my first language.)
Today, my mom get mad at me for turning on air conditioner.
It start like this, I was a little bit annoyed about something and make a face without knowing, I entered the living room where my mother and other family members was sitting and say something like ""It's hot, will turn on the air conditioner"" and I grabbed the remote and point it to the air conditioner. My mom looked at me and started insulting me, calling me name and stuff, I thought that she was mad at me for something else, so I opened the turn on the air conditioner and sit down next to her feet, and she used her feet to kick me away and say something like ""You're not my daughter, go away."" And so I looked at her, a little confused. I sat there for a minutes before I stood up and walked out of the room but she call me back in, and then she slapped me on my arm 2 times and 1 time on my face, she also pinch my arm really hard that it leave some bruises. I started crying and tried to leave the room 2 times but she would dragged me back in and lecture me. She was mad at me for turning on the air conditioner, my grandma(who is almost completely deaf and was sitting far away) lecture me too but I don't think she even know what happened. In the end, I managed to leave the room and sit alone outside.

"I have posted before about my dad being a narc and had loads of other mental health. We don't have a good relationship and I actually do hate him.

He has absolutely no respect for me but demands I treat him with the upmost respect. Due to my personality I don't take his shit, I challenge him back, I won't let him speak to me like shit and when I set a boundary, it's over my dead body will he break it (although he try's to break them every single day) my dad currently doesn't work, he's on benefits due to his mental health and it meant I became a young career, has the years have went on I've released the whole ""young career"" wasn't in fact what I was, my dad just gave me parent responsibility and stresses from about the age of 12. That includes , cleaning (he is a messy person so I have to clean up after him 24/7) cooking my meals and his, financial burdens, his mental health dumps etc. 

I recently mentioned how it would be nice to get a new cooker and fridge freezer (I never said I was going to, just mentioned that it would be nice) he took it upon himself to go buy a new fridge freezer ( never told me he was doing it or how much ) the fridge freezer he bought was 1k and is claiming I owe £500 of it (so half), basically putting me into £500 debt without my knowledge or agreement. I absolutely refuse to give him the money, it has caused crazy amounts of arguments and I tell him I'm on a budget and I can't afford to lose £500, he then goes on to tell me I can pay it back £50 a month.... is he joking? When I refused this as well he then started saying, the only reason you aren't willing to pay for half is because ""I'm up to my eyes in debt"" which is not true at all. He said that because I use the fridge freezer then I have added to the deterioration of it and that's why I need to pay half ( please bare in mind 1 the fridge freezer wasn't even broke and didn't need replacing 2 I moved in with my dad when I was 12 years old , that's how long we have had it, I was a child)  I feel like when its a parents house it's on them to pay for the up keep of their own house and that includes appliances  ( I plan on moving out this year) so I'm paying £500 for a fridge freezer that he will then keep for the next 10 years?? It doesn't make sense. He believes this should be the case if anything needs to be replaced in the  house , carpets, cookers, washing machines etc ... 

I did mention he was on benefits but I can assure you he's got no shortage of money when it comes to buying things for himself or his hobbies. 

I'm happy to accept if my thinking is wrong and he is in the right but it just doesn't sit well with me "
"
Hello, 3 years ago my family and I moved into a duplex. The neighboring family consist of a couple and their 4 kids. The parents are probably like 40, but they could fool me. They look like they’ve been on drugs for decades. I’ve had my experience with druggies and some of the interactions I’ve had with them made it very clear to me they’re on something. 

Their oldest son is 19, I’ll call him Aaron. 
Second oldest seems middle school age, I’ll call her Sarah. 
Then there’s two little ones, young elementary age for sure. 

Due to the fact that our houses are basically glued together, I can overhear a TON of fighting going on in there. Usually with Aaron and the parents or Aaron and Sarah. Some of the stuff I’ve overheard is really brutal. 

There will be times where I don’t hear/see the parents for days. Their car is usually gone during these times. Which leads me to believe they are just abandoning their kids and leaving Aaron to take care of them. He goes to work during the day, so who’s taking care of them then? The middle schooler? No one? 

There’s been a couple times I’ve tried to go over there to check it out when I think the two little kids are alone. Just to make sure they’re okay and see what’s happening. They never answer the door, which I understand. I’ve taught my kids to not answer for anyone as well. But I just really want to find out what’s going on and honestly I’m curious to see the state of that house on the inside. 

Nosiness aside, 

I’ve talked to Aaron a handful of times. He looks fully worn out. Constant fighting is exhausting enough, but then being abandoned to take care of your siblings? Who knows if the parents even take care of the children when they ARE around. 

I’ve told my kids to steer clear of them. I do not want my children ever interacting with their parents. 

My heart aches for those kids. Aaron shouldn’t have to be a father to them. They should be in a stable, loving home.

The obvious answer is to call CPS. But I know this can also open up a whole new can of awful things for the kids. Being separated/ worse homes. My thought was that this would be taking Aaron out of his Fiona Gallagher nightmare, but my wife thinks there might be a reason why he *hasnt* called CPS on his own yet. She has a point. I need input about this.  "
"help please. i’m 15 years old and im experiencing abuse from my parents, about half an hour ago i experienced a very scary situation with my dad. my parents and i are usually very close but whenever they had mad it gets really bad. me and my father were watching a movie like normal and then he spiraled. i started talking to him but he didn’t like the way my voice sounded (sometimes it gets high pitched due to puberty voice crack, etc) so he started drilling his finger into one of the sides of my skull. i told him to stop but he wouldn’t until i hit him in the stomach, he then started aggressively grabbing and gripping my body, specifically my arms and chest, i still have red marks and bruises from how hard he was doing it. when i managed to pull myself away i told him that what he did was child abuse and that it was an offense. he then proceeded to say these exact words to me, “if you ever call the cops, the day you call the cops on me, they’ll find nothing but a corpse.” by this point i was really scared, this wasn’t the dad that i knew, he would never have said anything like this. i tried to confront him to repeat that while holding my phone out, trying to record it, he obviously didn’t repeat it into the recording but instead said that i was the one who said that phrase. i then put it down and told him that if he knew what he just did, and what he said. i told him that people have ruined their whole lives saying that, have gone to prison and everything. he then got mad and grabbed me again aggressive, this time pulling out his phone and typing 911 into the dial of his phone, he held it out in front of me while grabbing and hitting me and told me to call the cops if i wanted, he was yelling at me to call them. i yelled stop and what was he was doing, i asked him to realize what he was doing. he then put his phone down and started punching, pulling, grabbing, gripping, and kicking me. all simultaneously while yelling at me, i don’t remember much of what he was saying, i was in shock, i’m sure he was just repeating the same thing over and over about calling the cops and about making me ruin his life. i also remember him yelling to call my mom (they’re divorced) to pick me up to take me to her house, but she’s working so that didn’t work out. i told him that i never stopped the recording on my phone and that it caught all of that, which was a bluff, he finally stopped. he then started searching for my phone, probably to destroy it. i had hid it under the sheets so despite all that he looked he couldn’t find it, i told him to just leave the room and he finally did. after that i was really scared and tried texting my mom, i told her everything that happened and she blamed it on me. she said it was my fault and that i provoked him, that it’s because of my behavior. she said it’s because i always cause problems (despite being divorced they both still talk, and she always supports him when we get into a fight because she wants to stay on his side to collect benefits, we’re going on a vacation soon and hes paying for all her expenses on the trip). i then told her that he needs to talk to him and get it together, how could you think that after what he said and what he did that he’s the one who’s the victim. she then told me that if i ever were to tell anyone or report it to anybody that he would kill himself and that there id be left with nothing. she said that the officers would take me to a children’s home and live a horrible life. she continued on with this a little more, saying that i’m the reason this happens, that it’s my behavior, that im the root of all problems, and that id be the reason they kill themselves. an extra detail i want to put in: i live with my dad and my grandma, but i didn’t think to go to my grandma about this (she was in the other room when this happened, because i knew she would back him up even further. whenever we get into fights she always supports my father, despite whatever he does, even when he does some truly messed up things. when she comes to bring me dinner later, she doesn’t say anything, she pretends nothing happened; i believe this is because she knows that this time he did mess up, that he was the one in the wrong, i’m scared of what she might to support him though. thinking about his death threat has made me thought that she would be capable of that as well, as long as to support her son from anything ever happening to him. another add on: i sleep in the same room as my grandmother due to us moving homes right now, so i don’t have my own room where i can lock myself away from them. please help, i don’t feel safe, and i don’t know what to do. i don’t feel safe sleeping this night, i have a feeling that something horrible going to happy this night. i feel as though they might do something while im asleep, please help. i left my last message to my mom with confidence, “i’m not dumb like other kids, i know my rights and im not afraid to use them” i will admit i got a little cocky but now im really scared. i know that if i call for help, like the cops or the domestic help line, that ill lose everything: my home, my future (i wouldn’t be able to live a life as good as the one i am now), my items, my extracurricular classes (music, acting, dance, etc) , my school (private), and my career (im an actor and a musician, my career was just starting to take off with a film i would be in, i’d lose everything). please help, i don’t know what to do, im really scared to keep living here, and i don’t have anyone who i can go to, even outside family would support my parents instead of me. i know that i need to get help, but i don’t want to lose everything. please help."
"tw: abuse 

long story short, my dad was abusive and lost custody of me when i was 13. haven’t talked to him since for the most part. 

he died in august. apparently there was only a copy of the will that wasn’t legally binding stating Karl (dads only friend) and Sam (uncle who cut me and whole family off) were executors. 

Karl doesn’t want anything to do w it because his mom just died and he’s dealing with it. Sam says ok i’ll do it. week later Sam calls me and says to get an attorney bc he’s not doing it. attorney tells me as long as i don’t touch anything im not responsible. 

months go by. Karl calls me and says my dad had lots of valuable paintings and baseball cards and a bank account w 10-80k in it. can’t provide proof. is the only one that’s been in the apt. wants me to sign papers claiming myself as the heir and naming him my attorney. 

in exchange for cleaning out the apt, storage unit, paying dads bills, etc, Karl will get half the paintings, all the cards and i’ll get the bank account. 

scenario 1: i sign, Karl takes all the valueables and leaves me all the bills and cleaning to do, im fucked 

scenario 2: i sign, karl is trustworthy but there are no valuables at all, and we’re both screwed 

scenario 3: i sign, there’s a ton, we’re both rich 

scenario 4: i pay an attorney to find out how much is in the bank. if there’s a lot, i take it and the responsibility. if there’s not, i say eff it. Karl is left out of it. 

scenario 5: i leave all of it now and never know 

things to consider: my dad used to be so poor he’d make me steal food. he lived his life in low income housing and spent money on trips to florida and beer and pizza. he was never into art. but he sold a lot of property and was always talking about moving to vegas and idk what he did for the last 10 years. 

tldr; 

if you had the opportunity to find out if you were an heiress but it meant you could be responsible for your dead abusive dads bills, would you do it? we’re talking like risk of -10k and reward up to +50k.  "
"We were bickering about something that occurred with my grandmothers phone, and she began to raise her voice, so I did the same in defense, she then proceeded to tell me to stfu and ""yell at me again and ill kick you in the f\*\*\*ing head"", then began to tell me how she would take me out to the backyard and beat me black and blue with a pipe if I didn't continue my school work (I am homeschooling so that is near impossible) and went on to tell me that any officer or cloister would take her side because ""violence is the only option and it works"" and then continued to tell me how she would kick and punch me in the head, and beat me with the pipe, and my grandmother who I live with would have no right to stop her or say anything because it would be hypocritical to stop her and not stop my uncle who used to lay his hands on his kids"
"It’s just really obvious.  She is jealous, I guess that I’m younger than her ??  And wants to make me jealous all the time.  Showed excitement a year ago when I was potentially terminally ill.  A year before that I almost died and she convinced me not to go to the hospital, which I did eventually, and it ended up saving my life.  Like she doesn’t just hate me she wants me to die."
"My girlfriend (17 FM) lives at home with her single father, and he has manic depression. I've been dating her for 4 months, and throughout this time I've helped her get through very stressful scenarios that have also taken a toll on my mental health. First, her father became suicidal after breaking up with his girlfriend, and my girlfriend had to help him through that. Then, her dad had a manic episode which led to him smashing everything in her room and pushing her to the floor, and kicking her out. I begged her to let me call the police, but she cares about her father so much that she begged me not to. They got over that and she moved back, and it's been good... Until he started talking to a new girl.  Tonight he had another manic epsiode because her dog knocked over and broke a small vase. Yes, a vase. Then his girlfriend over the phone was saying that he shouldn't let her dog on anything anymore because of it. He punished the dog by throwing him into a cage, and smashing on the wall of the cage to scare him. My girlfriend got mad because of how he was treating it over a literal accident, and then he lost his absolute marbles. Said that she has to keep her door open from now on even if she's getting changed, and it's her fault if he sees her naked. He said that she isn't allowed to go anywhere besides work or school until she graduates highschool, so I won't see her for 2 months. He also said that she needs to now pay 150$ a week to live there. Oh and also he kicked her off of the wifi so she can't contac4 me without data. It's really stressful, and I don't know how I can assist her through this. I know it's alot of a burden for me to take on, but I care about her and I hate seeing human beings go through such inhuman treatment. I feel like this isn't reasonable treatment, and I actually think it's abuse. Can I please get some advice 😭 I don't know what to do"
"When my Mum and dad got divorced I went to live with my dad for 2 years and then came to live with my mum and stepdad. We would regularly get into fights but not physical until they started getting physical and then we did not fight for 6 months so I thought it was all good until *stepdad me and mum*. One time our dog almost died for going through the bin and they blamed me of course. And about a month later or the day I’m writing this it happened again. Stepdad kept shouting at me that our dog almost died last time and I told him to shut the the fuck up and then he came at me and kicked me,This time I had some sense in me and I fought back. My mum didn’t even stop us. I have a bruise on my stomach and I’m currently in the bathroom and locked myself up in here cause I can’t deal with these shitty people anymore. My mum tried her best to be a good parent but she’s not fit for it. I wish I never existed. I’m glad my dad is supporting me in Australia through this. "

"Urgent ‼️ 
I 16F need to move out asap. My mother has always been both physically and emotionally abusive however, this last weekend was the end of any sort of peace. Long story short my mom came home tired and irritable Friday night and took it out on my family like usual. She got physically violent with multiple family members and I ended up calling the cops. She now has her third domestic violence charge and is being investigated for child endangerment. She is extremely mad at me and blamed me for this weekends events. She was jailed Friday night to Saturday morning when my older sister picked her up. She has since been away on a trip originally planned weeks prior but she gets back tonight. She has mad non stop threats over text in paragraphs blaming me, telling me she will take away everything and not provide even the bare minimum anymore. Now I can not be here anymore, it is no longer safe for not only my mental well being bust possibly even physical. i  only have one place to go. my grandma(moms mom) is the only long term option i have that is realistic to my schooling and work. she lives just 10 minutes from both my school and work and has a bus stop across the street from her neighborhood. We are on generally good TERMS and a neutral relationship but i haven't had much contact with her the past year and a half since my mom cut her off. i am thinking of offering to pay for groceries and gas when needed(which will be rarely thanks to the bus), do chores when needed, and i'm supposed to get a license soon and more than likely a car within the next month thanks to my grandpa(my dads dad). but i am still concerned on how im going to convince her to take me in for at least a year. I also don’t know how i will get my info from my mom without her freaking out because she will not be happy losing control over me. Any advice would help."
"Im turning 14 on the first of June this year and my parents are emotionally abusive. Let me just say some of the things that have happened, My mom often tells me that Im going to get her into a mental hospital, calls me stupid,laughs and tells me to shut up when I try to talk to her about how I feel.My dad was physically abusive and I was hit, kicked, and almost strangled but I luckily pushed him away in time. A few months ago my parents got into an enormous argument which caused them to live separately. My mom kicked me out of her house( for throwing something in the wrong bin btw) so I had to go live by my father. (PS:At this time I hadn’t been in school for a few months because I was told I was going to leave the country.) Almost every night he went to the bar and left me at home alone. One night I had to wait 6 hours for him to get back, the power went out and he took my phone with him because he claimed that I miss behaved, so I sat there in the dark for hours just sitting. When he got back, his whole head was open because apparently on his way back from the bar someone threw him with a brick and stole his phone, apple watch and credit card. He was shouting and screaming at me and even smashed plates broken. Our neighbours heard him screaming and luckily, one was a cop. So he called the police on my dad and punched him a few times, when I started to sob my dad told me “look what you have done”. My dad was kicked out of the house we were staying in and had to go live with my mom. A Social worker came and told us that me and my sisters must go to different families because of my parents. So my parents, me and my sisters had to leave the country. Im half dutch so we decided to go to THE NETHERLANDS. Btw much worse than this happened, Im just too disgusted to say it here.

So does anyone know a way that I can get away from my parents in The Netherlands? I don’t know any of my family from the Netherlands so I can’t go to them. A place I can go that isn’t an orphanage?Just to get away from my abusive parents please let me know. :)"
"My dad has done so many things in my life that are not considered normal, for instance he cut off all my hair with a pair of kitchen scissors as I begged him not to, I pleaded and pleaded but he cut it by force. Since then every tiny little thing I do that lands me in a bit of trouble he uses it against me. And the instance in which he even cut off my hair to begin with all I did was tell my sisters tutor that Im having trouble with biology and school is difficult, he then proceeded to tell my father that im an unserious student, that combined with petty complains of my unclean room and leaving dishes upstairs made him beat me up with a belt till I was bleeding and forcefully cut off my hair (I'm a girl by the way so this was very demoralzing and I became slightly depressed and had zero self confidence)  
My mum is barely any help whatsoever, she sometimes switches up and joins his side by adding fuel to the fire and if not she leaves and goes upstairs with the rest of my siblings so they don't witness all of this. I once went upstairs and pleaded and cried with her to make my dad stop and she looked at me with a pitiful look on her face and said there's nothing she can do. There's many instances this has happened and I can broadly mention them, once I put on press on nails and I was told they were ""too long"" (they were not that long) and I was told to remove them but then I forgot and the following evening he beat me up and almost cut my hair but luckly I hid the scissors prior. This has been off and on and my dad is bipolar because later on he can start calling me his ""sweet girl"" and act all lovingly to me. Trust me this is not the start there's so much more I can say. I can't go to a trusted adult because this is deemed as ""normal"" I also tried talking to a few teachers about it and they've done nothing whatsoever, im only 15 please give me any advice."
"Iam 15 (male) and my sister is 22, we live in pakistan,  ever since the farthest can recall my life I have always been subjected to a life of blatant favoritism, neglect and abuse. Regarding favoritism my sister was always the epitome of success and perfection amongst my parents and relatives alike, everything she did even if it was wrong was just passed off as a minor mistake by a princess, she was an average grade student  throughout her school life, an A+ student in middle school and pretty average throughout highschool (9th to 10th) and 11th-12th. Her results were always celebrated and she always recived tons of gifts. Whenever our distant relatives would come over or we would go to their houses she would always be greeted with such excitement and whatnot, given gifts, cash etc Meanwhile I was told to shut up and sit in a corner. Rarely got minor gifts and some slim money. Her pocket money has been 14000 pkr/month since she was 6, which isn't alot in first world countries but very valuable here. Meanwhile I have only been getting 1000 pkr since 13 years old. She would always have her friends over and I would be told to go to the rooftop for the time being her friends was there. I wasn't even allowed on the second floor of our house and the rooftop in the cracking heat of the sun has only 1 tiny shed with tools, bricks, boxes and cobwebs and whatnot. During special occassions and festivals like Eid or Birthdays. Mine would never even be celebrated I wouldn't even be wished most of the time while her celebration would be for 2 days. (Her birthday and the day before it). With again gifts and cash and whatnot. Also I only got a mobile phone at 13 after working in manual labour in construction for 1 year for 3 hours after school and saving up the money i'd get at the end of the day. The only electronic my parents ever bought me was a cheap tiny iBall tablet at 7 years old which upon reciving they forcefully took it from me saying ""just let your sister play on it for some time"" which she broke after raging in a videogame I broke down crying that day and never forgot. Oh and she had an iPad at that time. A genuine iPad pro and a good spec Panasonic phone btw all paid for by my parents. As a 12 year old ofcourse I didn't want to do construction labour, i wanted to play, have friends and have fun like any other child my parents forced me into it saying ""You'll have to make money one way or the other, we already take care of your sister so you'll burden us even more, you are a boy so make it work"". This is just scratching the surface I might write more in the future there is so much more I want to write about their favoritisim but let's cover the other 2 topics aswell. 
Regarding neglect. 

Most of the times when I would be sick with excruciating fever and other flus for days, my father wouldn't even give me medicine saying ""suck it up, walk it off already drink some water"" and whenever i'd try to sleep to alleviate the pain he'd always wake me up and force me to walk. It's only after multiple days that he'd finally call a local travelling doctor for a checkup, he woould  also try to cheap out on medicine like it was a game mind you the checkup and medicine together costed less than a dollar and he was still hesitant to pay for it. One February when i was 9 years old i woke up with extreme pain in my abdomen area, it felt like constantly being stabbed and torched at the same time and it did not stop. I woke up crying i did not know what it was I would always vomit anything i consumed any liquid, food anything. After 3 days of excruciating non stop crying, not being able to sleep and harming myself only did he take me to a hospital where upon checkup i was diagnosed with Chronic pancreatitis, only then did I recieve treatment and finally healed for the love of god. These are just 2 instances there are way more like the times my parents would go on trips with my sister and leave me alone in the house often with no food at all. 

Regarding abuse- 

Oh boy where do I start this brought me so much trauma even writing about it will probably make me unable to sleep tonight. Firstly when I was 8, my sister forcefully took my turn to play a retro game on my parents computer. I could just watch her play so I did, she sucked at the game and would punch the keyboard a few times. I'd tell her to stop she'd break it. Eventually she lashed out and broke the keyboard keys flew everywhere and it was completely cooked. I rushed to my dad and told him what happened i told him what my sister did with as much fear and truth as an 8 year old could emmit, my father upon reaching there saw my sister get up from her chair casually just pick her phone up from the desk and say ""he's the one who did it"" and my father completely believed her like no suspicion at all. You know what he did next? Took out a broomstick and started thrashing me mercilessly i jumped back and started crying asking him why is he doing this multiple times shes the one who broke it. He slapped me across the whole face multiple times my mother didn't give a single fuck and was reading a book with headphones in. He tied a rope to my (a fucking 8 year old's) arm and took me outside, he took me to the tree in the field next door and tied me up there while slapping me multiple times, locals came and asked what he was doing he made multiple excuses and exaggerated things until someone he knew came and told him something regarding not to tie under this tree no one goes under this tree because of some paranormal bullshit so my father took my home and locked me in the storage room upstairs (2nd floor) and smashed the broken keyboard on my head and locked me in for the rest of the day. All i had was a pot of water and nothing else. I was only unlocked after the sunset and given no food whatsoever all i could do was sob and cry sitting in the darkness while I tried to assemble the broken keys back onto the keyboard. This is just one instance oh no there is so much more. one day idk what age, i dropped 100 pkr (way way way less than a single dollar) and my punishment? Well kicked from home for the day (not the first time at all) then i was dragged back and tied up infront of my home and given water in a pot like a fucking animal idk what happened after that during the day but it was not fucking plesant. Oh just to showcase the irony, my sister stole 160k pkr from my parents locker. (45 something percent her dad's monthly income, he's never been a dad to me) and casually defended herself like nothing happened at all my parents believed her like she was god. All eyes were on me and even though they had no evidence on me i was kicked out of the house after being beaten and went to live with my aunt for a few days. During my third day at my aunt's my sister stole another 90k pkr from my parents locker this time I wasn't there so how could it be me?. Here's how I know it was my sister's doing. After I returned home i suspected her to the core. That night at 9:00 she messeged me saying ""smoothie tonight, my treat"" i was suspicious i asked her what's the catch why being nice to me she just told me to relax and she'd bring it over to me after 30 mins I was way too sus, eventually after she brought it i dipped my pinky in it and tasted it... It tasted... Bitter like something had been mixed in it. I thought it might be berry stems she forgot to remove but I was sceptical. She always kept barging into my room multiple times asking if I drank it i replied ""wait I'm busy ill put the glass outside when I'm done"" i was sure that she was trying to poison me... But then I remembered about the money i immediately dumped the smoothie in a polythene bag and hid it behind my wardrobe and pretended to my sister that I drank it. I knew she put her sleeping pills into it and I was right after 4 hours (1am) she slowly came into my room slowly turned on the lights poked my head a few times i pretended to be dead fucking asleep dead asleep. But I wasn't due to the paranoia, I didn't make a single move not a single word and saw from underneath my blanket her opening my parents locker (it was in my room) with a duplicate key and look for any money they might have left there still. After 10 minutes she couldn't find anything because they moved it all to the bank she just left. Next day I told my parents they questioned me doubted me etc etc but the pussies didn't dare confront my sister. My sister was always spoiled and threw a tantrum on every minor in convience my parents always fed her delusions and was visibily scared by her. Well a week after that alot happened, they discovered her being in severe debt and having written down the amount she stole in her diaries the people she gotta pay back what more she gotta steal etc etc. my parents being the absolute pussies cuddled up to her (22 ears old btw this happened in 2024 fucking 2024) like a fucking toddler and she said she didn't steal anything and it was her money and she took a loan etc etc for an A.I course. My parents believed her without a doubt paid off her debt and went back like nothing happened. She conned them like her bitches she had no course she is a university dropout she doesn't study has 0 books and never did they see that she doesn't fucking study. The night after that they discovered she sent nudes to over 5 guys and has been sending for the past 2 years after lying to them she doesn't talk to any guys. My aunt caught her when she was at her house. They discovered that when she was in university all she did was skip classes go to bars, drink behind their backs take addictive substances and sleep with multiple guys. They discovered the pictures of her and her guy ""friends"" her in their car drinking smoking and pictures of her and a dudes in hotel rooms. She had absolutely no shame and 1 day after that my father just said let's forget anything even happened and just went back to normal without even confronting her. She's still doing these things but they won't listen to me I have lost all hopes in them and want to cut them off asap. 

90% of the things are unmentioned. (Academic unfairness, privacy breach etc etc). If you read this far thank you and i appreciate you.

"They are literally crazy. If anything happen of we do something wrong the first ""punishment"" that comes to their minds is that theirs no food for us I mean are they crazy??!!!?? What did you mean no food for us.

And i am not doing well at school my grades are dropping my concentration is gone. I am tired I just wanna sleep and never wake up again..."
So my mom is mostly like this because of her ex-boyfriend and her job position as a manager if I try to say I’m sick all she will do it hit me with a belt and scream until I wake up it’s so bad I’m numb to it I don’t know where this came from but I can’t do anything

We live in such stress and horrible home they are always shouting always screaming at us my mother is a narcissist and always victimize herself and my father only listens to her he never try to understand or listen to us he just shouts and scream at us I have seen my big sister getting hit ever since I remember my mom would grab her from her hair and slap her hit her in the stomach. My parents always hit me too and my brother. I'm the middle child and I have been hit so much. And they always telling me stuff like ""you're a failure you will never get anything done in your life"" it's awful and the problem that we get abused for stupid reasons like watching TV for too long for eating much. It's horrible and there's nothing I can do I'm 17 and I have depression truma anger issues thinking of suic*de I'm tired and I don't know what to do..."
"Why do people do this? It baffles me, it truly does. I was victim of an abusive mother, and I went no contact years ago and never speak her name. I will never post about her on social media, I have deleted all traces of her from my life. 

However, SIL will tell anyone and everyone how bad her mother was to her as a child, and was estranged from her most of her adult life. But here’s what I don’t get…. She truly was an evil woman who beat her kids, drank herself silly everyday, had affairs and went on holiday and left them to fend for themselves. 

MIL died in the last 2/3 years and all SIL does now is post constantly about her mother and how she’s missing her and painting this false image to the world that her mother was this person she wasn’t. She is always posting about the milestones her mum is missing; her engagement, her upcoming wedding..! And how things would be different if she was here. I’m thinking ‘that is a lie’. She didn’t even bother to go to your graduation! Why would she care if u were getting married. 

I am really baffled as to why people lie when someone dies. Like all the bad they did never happened and suddenly they are the best mother that ever existed. Yesterday she posted one of her usual posts with pics of her and her mum when she was a kid, the usual garbage seeking attention and late last night I posted something on my Instagram about my own healing journey and she replied ‘so true’ ‘for real’ etc, but today she will prob post another attention seeking post for sympathy. 

Can someone explain why people do this? 
This person ruined your childhood with abuse, they left scars that no time heals, they die and suddenly they are promoted to saint hood overnight and can do no wrong! But when you talk to me u will tell me all the evil things she did but on Facebook u tell a different story! I can’t bare this attention seeking! "
