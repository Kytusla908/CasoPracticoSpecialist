so my mum is textbook abusive but not often enough that im certain shes the one thats a bad person and not me but not seldom enough that it can just slide as normal emotional stress or dysregulation so basically always always keeps repeating and doing things i tell her not to do then telling me that im being abusive to her when i get annoyed deliberately pissing me off like standing a metre away from me hours at a time while im trying to study even when i tell her respectfully that its difficult for me to focus then accuse me of not appreciating her not letting her do her duty as a mother comparing and name calling self explanatory any argument against her can never be won because she immediately goes like okay im always wrong and youre always right isnt it or you think you know everything you just have to blindly obey me or something to that extent i struggle with self harm her first reaction was to hit mebe like you are deliberately doing this to hurt me and continue doing it if you want me to die forcing me to do things i dont want like eat things i dont want i have to drop everything and do things for her or shell get angry but if i want or need anything then she gets angry the world operates on her schedule but like she gives me a home and a good education and stuff so like does she have the right to do these kinds of things and the internet tells you to set and establish boundaries but the thing is that this kind of people dont respect or recognise those boundaries so please tell me what can i do also i cant move out cos im lol,Positive
hello i have never made a reddit post before but here i am when i was a child my mother lost custody of me because she was and currently is addicted to drugs my father fought for custody of me and won although i was severely traumatized by my mothers addiction my father did his best to be there for me until he got a girlfriend when we met she said i was thinking we could be friends as a child i was like yay friend and became excited but as soon as it became official my father stopped spending nearly any time with me and began spending all of his time with his girlfriend next thing i know hes proposed to her dumb ass and were moving to a different city leaving all of my other family and only friends i knew i had to acclimate to a new setting my step mom began telling me what to do acting like my mother when we did not have a built relationship i did not respond well to this and cussed her out years into these issues she came at me one day slamming my body into the counter and throwing a french press at me i was when this happened and my step mom lied to my father saying that nothing happened the next day when i went to school i told my guidance counselor and he called my family they denied what happened just today ive had just about enough my ex boyfriend abused me when i said i wanted to be with women the first thing that popped into my mind was my step mom putting her hands on me i frequently have flash backs about my step moms behavior the worst part is shes a social worker therapist ethically bound to support those vulnerable to manipulation she violated her license by putting her hands on me all those years ago to this day she denies ever having done it im proud to say that through everything i havent fallen down the rabbit hole and have continued to work on myself and my career goals the issue is i dont want to be around my family anymore i just cant get over the fact that my step mom did that to me and then keeps asking to be in my life without taking responsibility i also called her the wicked bitch of the west and sent her a long message claiming how shes violated the field we both work in and asking her to not be around me without taking responsibility a message ive been putting off for the past years what should i do im at a crossroads and i dont want to reinforce to my family that this is okay,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i m have tried to be nice to my parents and support them for years i have been living with them because they cant seem to get their things together its now become that im paying of rent not even including the utilities and when i somehow have money its for their smoking habit and my dad constantly drinks my alcohol no matter where i hide it my fault i know making him aggressive but this entire month was my breaking point they asked for my very little savings for their smoking when i told them i wasnt even making enough to support myself with how much theyve taken from me the past years they just told me to stop making them feel guilty i had essentially had a meltdown and told them theres no way i was okay with any of this they had gotten so unappreciative in the past year given our history they should be glad ive stuck with them this long and other abusive parents would be begging for this kind of support from their child last year i wanted to get my own place but they had barely looked for their own place and again my heart got in the way of logic before i submitted the application i had i looked for places for us my new decision has to be that the bandaid has to be pulled off my dads an unemployed q enthusiastic narcissist and my mom has to unfortunately go down with him debt is hurting my chances of getting my own place and if i cant get out next year its as good as over for me tldr parents are financially abusive and its time for me to realize if i dont leave them next year its never gonna happen,Positive
i need some advice it will be a bit long but it is necessary to make the whole situation clear ever since i was a little girl my father told me that i had to work for his companynow im but i always said that i wanted to do something else at the moment i have a contract job but in order to continue working i will necessarily have to open a vat number and this will require a lot of costs for me but i would like to at least try to see what i can achieve in terms of work as soon as my father heard about it from my mother he started complaining and said that i have to give up and work for him he told me these precise words its not a request its an imposition you just have to do it my response was you have to mind your own business i want to see my things to understand where i can go almost crying in response he told me that if i continued talking he would punch me in the teeth and so to prevent the situation from getting worse i kept quiet he later told me that i will no longer be able to use the car not even if i pay him for petrol and that i will have to give him a month which is fine for me and continue to take care of my younger brothers now i have to take a step back to make the situation better clear for everyone years ago i ran away from home because my parents didnt allow me to study and didnt allow me to work they just wanted me to do the things they told me almost like a slave after my mother begged me i came back and things changed i continued to keep my brothers and do what they said but they gave me the opportunity to do smart working now after these years my father began to say that even if i earn large amounts of money with the work i do i wont have a future if i dont work for him the reason why i dont want to work for him is because he basically likes to control and subjugate his family with money and if he had this possibility with me too i would have to do everything he tells me otherwise he would also take away my salary i know because he often does it with my mother and my brother furthermore he is a traditional parent and expects me to get married in order to move away even though he said that if i get married my husband and i will have to live in the apartment next to theirs to be able to control us in any case if i worked for him and wanted to go away on my own getting married or not getting married it will be impossible because he will certainly take my money away now i ask you is it better to take a risk with the vat number or give in to what he tells me because this story has been going on for years and im exhausted now im also afraid of not being able to go on except with his help the funny thing is that he says he gave me so much when they literally use me like a slave who has to do everything for everyone and they didnt even let me finish my studies,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi so i wont tell my life story as its incredibly long in a nut shell my mum was mentally broken by a yr marriage with my dad a narcissist which left her emotionally and physically unavailable for her kids which i somewhat understand she did neglect me i didnt have a dentist i didnt have baths regularly brush my teeth most the time she didnt know where i was and i walked myself to school from years old she never told me she loved me or hugged me what i was beautiful ect she was very distant my dad left when i was which was a blessing and a curse anyway i become extremely angry and emotionaly abusive to my mum as i got older which i later learnt was reactive abuse fast forward a good years im almost have a child of my own and a good relationship and ive somewhat made leave with my past me and my mum are amicable we dont have a mother daughter relationship and we only see eachother it seems when we need something which makes me more angry because ive just always craved a motherly relationship the way i am with my child i tell her what she means to me every single day which makes me blow up the anger just comes back just recently it was my birthday she said happy birthday via facebook messenger and my daughter went to her hoise on my birthday when i saw her in person she didnt say a word about my birthday absoloutly nothing which isnt the first time which made me hurt and realise how much she will never love me all over again i held it in for a few months a cried it out alone but yesterday i asked her if i could have some birthday money but she already owed me money for something so she gave me what she owed me and said it was my birthday present we argued back and forth that she owed me money this was not a present and from there i blew up f top i told her she neglected me shes a f terrible parent two of her kids have left her and her last one will to all because she refuses to take any accountability i really dug into her and i was shouting at the top of my lungs she kept blaming my dad over and over again like she always does anyway the point of this post is how the f do i stop this the birthday scenario was a trigger point clearly and im allowed to me mad at how i was treated but the way i lay into her is absoloutly unacceptable i have become emotionally abusive towards my mum i say i have forgiven her but when it comes up it appears i never will it hurts so much and this happened infront of my daughter to which i am so upset about i ended up crying my heart out while my dsughter held me shes she dosent need to see that luckily shes a very empathetic kid and she said its ok mum we all need to let our emotions out my daughter is mildly aware of how my mum has treated me now which is shit because she has a good relationship with my mum her nanny and i really hope it dosent tarnish it i studied psychology and i understand most of it but i cant seem to thathom why i still do this and im heavily considering the fact i may have bpd,Positive

i was in a car accident and it made my anxiety so bad when it comes to driving im scared to drive i dont have a license im stuck living with my mom who treats me like a sack of shit its fucking horrible we live in a basement apartment so space is tight weve moved a lot because my mom gambled away our house and nearly bankrupted my father i always like to think things were worse when i was younger but its happening again my mom had no money and i was only able to bathe times a week as a child which led to some serious hygiene and selfesteem issues when i was younger im and its happening again i think shes really losing it i get screamed at if i have a bath and she blames me for the mold problem in the house she keeps telling me im not allowed to have a bath and she will take away the drain plug and the towels if i do so although i couldnt care less it is so frustrating aside from that i am yelled at from the moment i wake up until i go to sleep i am not a bad person and im rarely home i work go to school and volunteer days a week through my school program it fucking sucks i try so hard to do everything and all she does is bring me down im on the deans honours list and she doesnt care she just gets mad that my dad saved money for me to go to school and that could have been money in her pocket i hate to think that things were bad but they were she used to leave me in the hotel room for hours when i was younger little did i know i would lose my home to the casino and never really feel like id have one again im rambling now anyway im stuck in my room im not allowed to have anything of my belongings including me outside of it i slept for over hours yesterday after work when i meant to take a nap my mom came home from work and i woke up to her yelling at me i was just so tired of it that i went back to sleep its so overwhelming i cant escape her she follows me around yelling she will unlock the bathroom door to yell at me she sends me really rude texts it just becomes so out of hand that i want to move far far away and never come back i dont know if i would feel so guilty the mental abuse played a role in my social anxiety but i think about it and realize parents get mad but this isnt normal we used to snap the wood off doors because i would stack my things and put my feet on the door just to keep her out of my room because she would chase me screaming and calling me a whore i was i cant name a day where she hadnt yelled at me she ran out of things to yell about so today when i told her to shut up she just opened my door and called me a fucking cunt times everyone always says ignore her and to not say anything but i cant anymore there is no one to defend me and i was quiet for so long but it didnt help she would follow me and get in my face until i said something she even taunts me to hit her i never have but it takes a lot when shes in my face i dont even know i just needed to rant i wish things were different i wish someone was there and could see what ive been through,Positive
ok reddithelp me out here is this emotional abuse or am i overreacting im using a throwaway because my friends family know my main but if anyone needs to verify anything with me let me know first point i am an adult female in my own place name is on the lease my mom lives with me because of a very long story thats semi irrelevant to this one thing that irks me is that she says that she got me this apartment she was the one who forced me to call places until something sprang up and seems to want to take credit for the entirety of getting me in this apartment this is a red flag to me second point she went through my phone and forced me to commit chargeback fraud on over fifty people and has not apologized for it whatsoever and said shed do it again i had to do severe damage control and lost all my friends due to another long story she still has to help me pay bills because my idiotic actions left me without a stable bank account but im fixing it slowly third point combining one and two she is so surprised i dislike her i should mention my dad is not in the picture but he is alive they dont speak anyway what stirred me to make this post is that she used chatgpt to essentially imply that i dont have a personality and when i talked to her about it she said i was nitpicking small details and gaslighting her she also says im abusive because i use her and treat her like shit in her words heres the afromented screenshot i amfloored is she abusing me emotionally or just very mean im not saying ive been a saint but heres some other things she does throws my dad under the bus because he left when i was constantly gets upset that i treat my dad better than i treat her called me a patient instead of her daughter guilt trips me constantly because i dont act like a friend to her gets upset when i dont get her gifts for holidays despite her proclaiming several times how much she dislikes her birthday holidays materialistic things when i do something handmade she complained that it wasnt as good as what i do for myself so i stopped altogether vents to me about her job and her personal friends instead of getting therapy constantly negs me about my appearance i have depression and a physical disability as well as mental illness so some stuff i just get worn out doing like my hair im working on it any time i am genuinely happy she tries to fuck with me mentally ie i was friends with a lot of artists before the chargeback fraud and now no one speaks to me because it was through me that it happened i could go on but she does a lot of good for me too like got me through school and helping me write emails to succeed in places i flounder i struggle socially because of autism too and without her i couldntve done a lot but i feel worse around her than i do better and i want to make sure im not acting entitled or out of my mind,Positive
for reference i am a year old boy not super young but also not a super rebellious and angsty teen my whole life ive grown up in a house with screaming and a single parent who threatens me and calls me things such as scumbag piece of shit ect basically my father is on all sorts of medications because hes insane ill talk about what he does later in this but for now ill explain why i cant help myself if i tried my mom is having trouble looking for a place to live and having me would make it harder to find a place because of her limited budget and time to find a place with enough room because im not small or anything im the size of a grown adult finding a place with another bedroom could make it more complicated especially considering theres already two toddlers shes trying to take care of with barely any money and i could not contact cps because theres no place i could go because all ties with most family are cut so theres no one around here who could take me in if anything happened stuff at home is rough my father who is on enough medication to be considered a clinical drug addict lashes out over stuff i didnt do or stuff that hes usually fine with but just changes up for example he lost something and bought a replacement but then he found it some time later and asked me so where was it because it wasnt here before mind you i did not touch it or anything else that he was accusing me of but he refuses to believe me based off of his own delusions i am scared and concerned so i ask are you off your meds and he says no but maybe if you were on some you would be normal he says this even though he has been given the option to get medication for my adhd but was just too lazy to fill paperwork or pick it up he continues to blame stuff on me and lash out even though he was there when i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety likely caused by my living environment along with my recent diagnosis of autism he also knows about my struggles with sh and suicidal thoughts so its not like he doesnt know how what he does can affect me he just doesnt care he yells at me with two of my friends upstairs and yells at them to go home even though i didnt do anything and he just messed up but refuses to believe it this is getting kind of long so ill make a list of things he has done pushed shoved me into walls onto the floor and outside in front of other people whipped me with my own clothing such as heavy pants and coats spit in my face raised his hand at me just to get me to flinch yells at me shut the fuck up whenever i try to help with the situation where hes yelling at my brother messes up my room just to tell me to clean what he did makes me stop everything i do just to grab him some alcohol which is a couple steps away break my belongings just to see me upset about it destroy or take away stuff that other people got for me threatened to take away everything i care about and get rid of any communication with the people i care about such as my friends and my girlfriend the list goes on but i dont have much longer to type so ill cut it here,Positive

theres a lifetime of things i could give for context of my dad but essentially my dad is extremely selfish and i dont doubt that he cares for me and my family but thats overshadowed for his desire to fill his own pockets that are filled with millions of dollars as well as two million dollar homes also in my dad bought a very nice f for k that just sits at our vacation place soon to be where my parents move to for retirement so right now our car situation leaves us with a infinity suv for my mom a ford escape for my brother and in college but taking the year off a ford escape for my dad and a ford explorer for me m however my dads car is a company car that hes going to lose when he retires in a couple weeks as he is hes been telling me that hes going to be sharing a car with me and if i have to ill drive my brothers car at times my mom and i are livid because this does nothing but create problems for us as i would constantly be going to school which means no car for somebody from am to pm but the main reason were pissed is because my dad could literally drive the truck he payed k for but chooses not to im also pissed because my dad has enough money solicit him think about buying an old porsche for himself and he constantly tried to paint me as an entitled brat for expecting me to have my own car i just think that when a parent has as much money as him a child really should have their own car especially in a situation where if he drives his truck i would get a car without him paying a dime also its worth noting that the explorer has doo doo resale value as its with k miles on it with a replaced engine that has k miles on it so its not like he could sell it for a lot if thats what hes worried about am i right to be upset,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mum has neglected me my entire life shes also been emotionally and physically abusive at other times but the prevalent theme is her being neglectful she also gets so annoyed with me that i cant do apparently easy tasks but its not like shes ever shown me how to do it she gets annoyed if i forget to clean up after myself but she rarely ever cleans anything i have had a really bad unhealthy diet but shell belittle me for any attempt at improvement and its not like she eats healthy at all or anything like sorry i dont know how to regulate my own emotions in a healthy way i had to talk my own mother out of suicide multiple times before the age of the worst thing is is anything i somehow manage to find success in shell brag to people she knows about how good a parent she is ive not been successful at holding down a job because i got raised well ive been successful at holding down a job because its my only potential way out shell take credit for my own accomplishments but wont acknowledge how much more difficult shes made my life by just bothering to teach me anything,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
mom just came up and told me we are leaving at its right now i do not want to go to school what do i do i dont want to go what the fuck do i do im panicking its still pitch black outside when mom was paying on the door like a fucking psychopath i thought i was dreaming i asked mom if she was going to go and help me get my bus schedule and my class schedule because we still dont have it and school is today or if she was going to abandon me and she said she was going to call the school at seven and if i have my bus information by then then im getting on the bus by myself and then im going to the office at the alternative school by myself and getting my schedule all by myself i told her that shes basically abandoning me and fucking said ooh youre and can get a schedule yourself i just got up and fucking left after that she thinks that just because im now i can literally do everything by myself i think she genuinely believes that now that im i am suddenly capable of doing everything by myself and i am no longer mentally ill she claims to not have narcissistic personality disorder but im sure that she does shes always comparing me to herself and how she was able to do everything on her own the only way shes capable of doing everything on her own was was because her parents kicked her out several times she had like jobs at once and she was pregnant and forced to get married to a man she hated she was a dumbass teenager which is forced to grow up too early and now she blames me for her own scars because of my autism adhd and whatever other undiagnosed mental illnesses i cant mature in a mental senes ive tried so hard to like an adultto be very maturebut no matter what i do i still feel like a little kid people still tell me im super immature for my age i dont think i can grow up my social anxiety is eating me alive i dont even know what to do i just want to curl up in a ball in the corner and cry,Neutral
my mom has anger issues and says a ton of horrible things when ever she is slightly inconvenienced for example one morning was complaining about my ocd and how i wasnt sure if i could go to school and she said just kill yourself she also often threatens to hurt me but never acts on it and threatens to leave my dad and live her own life away from us theres a lot more but i think that these stories highlight the majority of it,Neutral
im f ive posted on this sub before just to vent out if anyone wants its on my profile to read might give some context as to relationshis w dam and sibling l so here i am once again all i can say is that its getting worse i dont know my sister has been supportive surprisingly we had a few talks over the course of months and realised where we both were wronged and have been learning to communicate properly w each other and be nice ish shes gotten to the point of ignoring my mother when she starts talking shit which is a lot btw and occasionally defends me if its too serious during a recent visit to my sisters place my sister realised im not as useless as my mom and dad project and when i have something to do i do it without complaints or anything like that im also patient and stuff we did have a few arguments but for the first time in our lives we communicated through it and sorted it without it turning serious my sister claims her therapist also noted that we communicate properly or at least better when our parents specifically our mother isnt around which i was happy about i honestly dont know what structure this post is following i tried to have a secret journal to write all this in and my mother found it burnt it and then yelled at me for a week i didnt eat for days straight and lived on water alone because she also locked me outside the house for those days i slept outside in the garden w my cats blanket that my mother had kept to throw out neighbours didnt give a fuck before anyone asks abuse is normal in this country moving on i dont know how to handle this anymore minor trigger warning but i constantly have the urge to self harm or harm someone else now im forgetting a lot of things in my day to day life such as words actions etc physical symptoms wise i seem to keep putting on weight not losing a single kg yet i eat normally i work in sports so nutrition is key no amount of excercise meal planning etc is helping my tolerance level for loud noises etc has reduced a lot making me extra sensitive to everything my grades are decentish last semester but i have no hope of going anywhere with those gpa i also seem to have little to no hope for the future this country doesnt allow for working opportunities to earn until post graduation unless its small time jobs like assistant in a small tea shop etc i cant save the money i have from scholarships because my mother makes me spend it for stuff for her without money i cant survive on my own since i have no support no skills etc so i cant move out either my graduation major requires a masters degree minimum if i need to work in that field which is also fucked up but understandable i dont know what to do anymore because life is becoming very bleak and im close to running out of hope for life my mother still maintains a sparkling image outside the world so i dont even know how to approach anyone about this either being well established doesnt work in my favour here yeah im currently hiding out and writing this hence the lack of structure,Positive

i moved away a few months ago and left my little sister today she called and told me about last night that there was the same old stuff between my parents yelling throwing things screaming leaving the house and threats they pulled her into it and she hasnt been put in that kind of situation alone usually i was there to keep her out of it she was forced to pick a parent at am because they decided to divorce this is a regular occurrence i told her not to worry and that those irrational decisions and threats arent the real thing to pick what ever she feels safest with picking the abuser if thats safer at the moment since the next morning would be better and she would be left with the reprucussions of her choice from the night before i told her the real final decision is where others lawyers social worker cps whatever it is would be involved in the actual final decision i think that helped put her worries to rest it hurt because i wasnt there to help her i got away from that shit and left my favorite person on the planet behind i feel guilty i want to become a self reliant and stable adult so when she is older she can move in with me but right now i cant do much and its painful after the phone call i literally cried any other siblings understand this,Positive
what is or was your worst trauma response and if youve gotten over it how did you do it mine is this if anyone in the room or house is angry i feel like its directed at me and that i need to immediately leave rectify it somehow if i can or make myself smaller dont make eye contact and for the love of god pray they dont see me and direct any of their rage towards me im slowly getting over this by reminding myself that their problems arent my fault and i dont need to fix it the immediate reaction is still fight flight or fawn though im seeking ways to try and move along,Neutral

i yo nb am a single child my mother is an abusive person everyone around me in my life agrees and i wish it wasnt this way to paint a picture of who she is she tried to choke me to death when i was threatened to kill me times as a child tries to cut me off from other people knew about and allowed an ex bf to abuse and sa me she will constantly take her anger out on me by screaming at me about her problems as if its my fault and then punishes me just because shes having a bad day she once took all my belongings because i had an apple in my room one time she beat me just because i came home ext last week i had school orientation at a new school students and parents where directed into separate places i followed instructions of my teachers the whole time my mom later screamed at me because i didnt follow her or the schools directions on where to go even though i very much so did and other students who where with me confirmed that i in fact did exactly as told instead she refused to listen and took my phone and then screamed at me the whole car ride she said im useless and she hates me im a disappointment and cant do anything she went on and on for about hours still yelling at me not even about the subject just purely insulting me i dont feel safe in my home and i moved over the summer so now i have no irl friends and dont know what to do or where to go i hate my family and this house i feel trapped and scared all the time what do i do,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im f my childhood wasnt really bad ive had a mum and dad present throughout my life they divorced when i was a baby so ive never seen them in love which definitely affected me my mum had several partners when i was growing up i would always grow attached to these men and then theyd leave so i have really bad abandonment issues now one of my mums husbands used to shout at me and really scare me my mum would get drunk and run away and my step dad would scream at me asking where she is i had no idea one time he got really angry at dinner and shouted and smashed his plate on the floor i was always terrified of him i could not stand up for myself or speak my mind because i was afraid of him my mum rarely stood up for me and neither she nor my dad have ever really been emotionally available i dont think my dad has ever hugged me but hes never been abusive to me hes just a bit emotionally distant my mum has said some really hurtful things to me when i was a child she rarely hugged me when i cried she usually just exasperatedly said why are you crying to which i often didnt have an answer as i couldnt express myself because shes never created a safe space for me to be emotionally vulnerable with her a few months ago i went through a really difficult breakup and i travelled home from uni because i needed some comfort she didnt hug me she didnt even pick me up from the train station i had to ask my friend to when i was crying the whole time she told me to get a grip and stop crying and get over it that is pretty much her approach to every time i cry she has always compared me to my friends or her friends kids and made me feel like im not good enough she has said im not normal for wanting to come home from uni in the holidays instead of staying there alone every time i come home she makes me feel unwelcome by complaining about having to buy food for me whenever i have tried to talk to her about how she has hurt me or affected me she either denies refuses to acknowledge my emotions or just starts guilt tripping me and says im a bad mum so yeah i am just wondering if any of you would consider any of that emotional abuse im not sure its really bad enough to be considered abuse but it has defo affected and hurt me,Positive
i have a friend whom i have told about the horrible things said to me and the psychological games played on me she asked a question the other night that was you werent locked in a room and beaten were you her intent being the lifetime of being told by my parents that im stupid im ugly and even more grotesque things them hiring people to terrorize me them playing psychological mind games on me them giving my now yo sibling everything so she never has had to work a minute in her life is not anything to be bothered about is she wrong or am i for being frustrated and more about what has been done to me,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

help my parents are getting more and more insane this summer has been a nonstop torture session from them they dont let me go outside unless they chaperone and monitor every move they force me to wear the most masculine clothes possible every sunday they make everyone slave off and i hide in my room to avoid it they actively take me out on trips to do only what they want and trick me into thinking ill be doing the stuff i want on top of that just so they can feel superior by restricting what i do and then gaslight me into thinking im abusive and hostile for wanting basic human rights today alone they even blocked the door while they were making everybody else slave off in the hot sun so i couldnt sneak down for lunch meaning i was starving feeling like i was going to pass out from heat exhaustion in just days im being sent back to another year of this horrible special needs school full of delinquents and criminals where psychopaths and a literal criminal violent roadman incel harrass me laugh at me and even call me slurs for how i look as well as my focusing problems ive developed over time from being trapped in my room for years they even gaslight me into thinking i never said yes to a driving test when i said yes twice just so they can trap me into adulthood and have even tried to bribe me so i stay too its absolute hell on earth im scared even writing this thinking my parents might know about my reddit accounts existence especially just a few days after my dad said snitches get stitches quite aggressively when i stood up to my brother and told him what he was saying behind his back this was originally posted on raised by narcissists but it was rejected for low reddit karma because apparently what people disagree with me on is more important than my fcking living conditions,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hey yall really need to write down my feelings somewhere or else i will explode so my mother is emotionally abusive and neglectful and has ruined my childhood permanently not only is she abusive but shes also a bodyshamer especially when it comes to her children my older sibling and i both went through her harassment once we started puberty earlier she always made passiveaggressive comments when we ate too much but she started outright body shaming us once we both reached the age of roughly years old i was slightly less fortunate than my older sibling who stayed relatively slim during puberty and gained quite a bit weight during puberty and my mother wouldnt let me forget she always compared me to my older sibling and i couldnt eat anything remotely sweet so i developed an eating disorder and ate only meals a day for roughly months it got better eventually but even now i eat less than a normal person recently my younger sibling turned and obviously its not enough for my mother that she already gave of her children an ed because shes working hard on making that a shes been commenting relentlessly on how much my younger sibling eats and its sickening today my little sister had ice cream for dessert and then she made herself a small glass of mint sirup icky if you ask me my mother immediately told her off and warned her that shell get fat she said quote wont your ass explode from all this sugar she said it in our native language so the translation is slightly weird and heres where it gets worse she said the exact same fucking sentence to me for years with the exact same tone of disgust and its killing me how can someone birth three children and then hate their bodies so much im terrified my little sibling will go down the same path i did and i hate my mother for even daring to say such a thing so yea i really needed to rant somewhere take care everyone and stay safe,Positive
the problem is my violent childhood caused by my dad hes in prison but i cant help but wonder why my grandmother still thinks that my dad could possibly come and live with us me my siblings and my mother even after my dad tried to hit my mother with a car my grandmother doesnt realise how harmful he is to us she obviously doesnt want her son to be abandoned and alone when he comes out of prison but i feel like she doesnt even think about how we might feel does she really expect us to put up with such violence and aggression shouldnt a grandmother want the best for you especially when it comes to safety this is what mainly bothers me ive distanced myself for the last year but i miss my grandmother and i struggle with loneliness in general i dont want to be the reason that i dont see my grandmother but i feel so disrespected in her presence does she really expect her grandchildren to accept the violent actions of their father i wish she could just be our grandmother instead of letting my dad come between us what do you guys think i dont know how to feel entirely we have had serious conversations about my dad before but it seems like my grandmother really wants my dad to live with us how can she be okay knowing that were not living peacefully for now im planning on speaking to her in the future about all of this but i need yalls perspective do i think i know better than my own grandmother am i rude and ungrateful should i just forget about everything and pretend like everything is fine,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

ps i have bad english i am m who lives with my mom and dad who is underweight havent used a shower for at least a week and i have not slept in a day for my whole life and my mental has been degrading this year and with the recent starting of school to the point where i want to kill my self my father acts abusive to me when he is at home but when he is out in public he acts like a saint the abuse started when i was he would usually hit me with his belt and sometimes give me spankings over the smallest things to the point where i would cry for almost a hour he would threaten me when i couldnt find something or break something and he would say stuff like i will crack your skull open or i will beat your ass and i will disown you and these threats he wouldnt yell out constantly but i have been traumatized from theses threats he would lash out at me for the stupid things like not doing my hair in the morning which i have been grounded for not eating breakfast at school having my mom help me with things i cant do and sometimes he would out right would call me stupid or a idiot for messing something up which caused me to be scared of him and sometimes he flat out would not feed me at all i get very little to eat which would probably explain why i am underweight the only safe place to me is school i have talked to my school counselor about the problem and so far they havent done anything yet and i have no idea what i should do,Neutral
tw sa truama hi yall so i have a situation here that i could use some advice on im f and have three younger brothers and a very abusive birth mother and step father growing up in their house i endured more physical and emotional abuse than i ever knew was possible its taken me years and thousands of dollars worth of therapy to start healing from my step father sad me from rd grade up until i was years old and i left the house immediately the only people who know are my paternal and maternal grandmothers my maternal grandmothers husband and my husband besides them i have been to scared to tell anyone else about the repeated rape however i have since received custody of one of my brothers my mother has brainwashed one of my brothers to hate me by saying i was manipulative and brainwashing my brother i have to hate them and make up abuse accusations against them and the other is to young to understand the brother i have hates his father my step father in a very similar way that i do and shows signs of sexual abuse however he says nothing has happened to him and maybe it hasnt but i worry very much about him there is a threat that he will be forced back in to the home with his parents he doesnt want that and neither do i so i guess my question is should i file charges on the repeated rape in my state there is no statute of limitations on sa of a minor and i worry that if i dont they will put him back in the home with his parents and something very bad will happen to him and maybe if i do finally come out about the abuse he will come forward as well if anything regarding sa has happened to himim so lost on what to do and would really appreciate some advice or other perspectives,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
a lot of people like to down play and normalize the abuse children go through while in living in arab household as do the children that are being abused and there is a reason for this the reason being it is hard to accept that their parents the people that are supposed to care for you the most are actually the ones scaring you and hurting you its much easier to be in denial than face it with all the pain and heartbreak that doing so will entail which is why they are so stuck on believing that this kind of treatment is a normal way to be treated which is just upsetting because everyone deserves to be respected and well treated by their parents,Positive
i had a dream i was being abused i felt so much fear in the dream and i woke up crying and it made me think about the fear my siblings must feel towards my mom since shes abusive dont worry shes been reported by me and my therapist so hopefully something happens and i just have been sobbing thinking about them and i feel so terrible and sad i just wish i could help them more,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

tw domestic violence and child abuse apologies for the long post i just needed to get it out f i grew up with a stepdad who was emotionally abusive towards our whole house and physically abusive towards my mother my mom met him when i was and they had my sisters and got married when i was we moved hours away from all of our family so we could afford a better life we went from living in a small apartment to a big new house things got really bad after we moved he would scream at my mom all the time and it got physical a handful of times it didnt happen everyday but the few times that it did were insane and i constantly feared that it would happen again any time they fought just straight up punching her head over and over the last time he hit her she almost died my little sisters in elementary school at the time were in the car with them when my parents started fighting and he kept hitting her until she was able to get out of the car at a red light and run to the nearest store for help i came home from high school that day to my stepdad sitting outside of our house waiting for the cops to pick him up there were a couple other times too and i was always scared about it happening when theyd start arguing im the oldest child and always worried about what would happen if we lost my mom i was worried that if i told anybody about the abuse id move back to our home state to be with my paternal grandparents and my sisters would be taken to a foster home i also wouldnt tell my mom about the way hed speak to me and make me feel when she was at work because i didnt want her to be more stressed or risk her getting hurt by confronting him it was a lot to handle as a kid luckily after the incident i described above he never hit her again except for the time when he whipped her with christmas lights when they were putting up the christmas tree a few years ago as far as my relationship with him goes he was an awful stepparent one time he told my to get my real dad who was an absent addict to get me food as he bought my sisters and himself wendys but didnt get me anything he screamed at my sisters when they tried to give me some of their food i was around my mom was working at the time and yelled at him afterwards but obviously that didnt change anything as i got older he would never look at me or speak to me it was like i didnt exist it fucked with my self esteem as a teenager and made me feel uncomfortable in my own home its like that to this day when i see him except for the time about years ago when my sister and i were fighting over a lipstick and he tried to intimidate me by barging into the room and yelling i went chest to chest with him and said what are you going to hit me are you going to beat another woman talk about empowering oh wait actually he did scream at me over the phone last month when i was talking to my mom i told her my psychologist diagnosed me with cptsd because of the childhood trauma and he was screaming about how im crazy and that he didnt do anything my sisters also despise him he hurt them too ill never forget when he left us at home to go to the store and it started snowing we live in the south and it never snowed there like it had where we used to live i was i called my mom she gave me a flip phone at that age because my stepdad wouldnt always answer her calls and she needed to have communication with us if there was ever an emergency and i asked her if we could go outside she said yes so we bundled up so full of joy and went out to play we made snowmen and snow angels and had the best time there wasnt a ton of snow so we did go to the front yard after the back ran out of the good stuff when my stepdad came home he was enraged to find us outside i told him that my mom said that we could but he didnt care once we got inside i watched him pick up my sisters one after another by the hair feet off of the ground and hit their butts with full force i didnt know what to do so i ran upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom after beating them he ran to where i was and banged on the door telling me that i was next if i ever did that again that really fucked all of us up my mom defends him because his parents werent strict so he was just trying to be a good parent unlike what he had she wont acknowledge that it was abuse after all it was just one time i still visit my mom and my youngest sister at their house where my stepdad also lives as theyre still married it is so uncomfortable i hate having him around but my mom and him have worked it out and my mom tells me that she has forgiven him and moved on and i should too maybe i could if i truly thought that he changed it wouldnt take away the trauma but maybe it would help although he doesnt physically hurt her he makes humiliating comments and is just a very disrespectful person towards my mother and youngest sister i have no respect for him as one could expect i have a lot of mental health issues i am preparing to start my own family and i just started getting long overdue professional help because i absolutely will not continue this cycle of generational trauma with my own children i have been diagnosed with anxiety complex ptsd and depression i recently told a few of my family members on my fathers side about what happened to me i did also say that he was physically abusive towards my mom but i left out all of the details because i felt uncomfortable sharing her business nobody in our family knows anything about what happened and ive had this dark secret bottled up my entire life i did let my mom know that i shared this with them because i didnt want her finding out by getting unexpectedly asked about it she was angry with my and said that people were going to talk about her and call her a terrible mother the next day i called her again literally sobbing telling her that i dont understand how she could love a man who has hurt us so badly i have a psychological injury because of this person and she still is with him if anybody looked at my dog the wrong way i would cut them off but she tolerates the emotional and mental damage that a man caused her children i told her that it was her job to protect me and she didnt i understand that it is hard to get out of an abusive situation but she was always the breadwinner and it was years of abuse that shed just keep forgiving him for the words he only hit me twice came out of her mouth and i was shocked first it wasnt just twice second we dont let people do that and still be in our lives what the actual fuck she said i was being dramatic and that it happened a long time ago and she cant believe that im still bothered by it when i asked why she would stay with a man who refused to feed her child out of spite she said she didnt have to answer my questions then she told me that im only upset about everything because my dad died my bio dad died of an overdose years ago and that caused me a lot of pain but it has nothing to do with this she then said that the reason i cant get pregnant is because i let other people affect me how fucking disgusting although she says that my stepfather was absolutely wrong she gaslights me and says im the one letting these things get to me and that i need to relax that is fucking terrible i love my mother but i wish that i had my old mom back my siblings and i all agree that it was like someone flipped a switch after she almost got killed and shes never been the same she refuses to seek professional help even though she clearly needs it when we dont talk about our childhood things are really great but unfortunately this isnt something that can be swept under the rug i really feel like she chose this man over us even though she doesnt admit it and says thats a stupid thing to say as i hope to become pregnant soon the thing that ive worried about my entire life is what will i do when they want to see their grandmother id like for her to be in their lives but my stepfather cannot my mom says that he doesnt have to be and that i can just pretend like he is deadso he is going to be a secret from my kids or some weird man that is married to their grandma i dont want them around him at all my kids will never have to feel uncomfortable around someone like i was with him after the last conversation with my mother im realizing that shell never leave him and i need to either accept my stepdad into my life he doesnt care for my either because i actually call him out or i need to go low or no contact with my mom i need this burden lifted from me i grew up always being protective of my mother and i dont want to lose her but i cant accept that she didnt do her job to protect us and i cant have my kids grow up with my stepdad in their bubble i know that my mom wants me to move on because thats what she has done she doesnt understand why i cant forgive and let it goi cant let it go because i refuse to tolerate abuse and shes lucky that thats what i took from my upbringing rather than get into an abusive relationship myself im just so lost im seeing a therapist in weeks so hopefully i can feel more at peace with a decision my sisters are in the same boat my youngest one is unfortunately still living with them but with most likely move in with my amazing sweet and extremely loving husband once she graduates next year at least we have each other i dont

to all the family and people in my life that have tried to make me understand the pov of my abusive uncle heres what you should understand hes a great guy and hes trying his best you could have ended up somewhere even worst you have to admit you did give him a hard time you were always troubled this was said to me so much growing up that i thought ok there is something wrong with me i am troubled and bad meanwhile he was screaming at me for spilling milk yelling at me for being clumsy and dropping things like i intentionally did these things for having an attitude when rly i was standing up for myself publicly humiliating me in grocery stores by punishing me with pushups pushing me so hard to lose weight that i would pass out from exhaustion and nearly heat stroke threatening to send me away somewhere worst going behind my back to ask my school counselor what was talked about in sessions my school counselor actually telling him bc she felt he should do better but only making it worst when i got home never expressing love never hugged me once unless i did for every thing ive ever done wrong instead of being taught why it was wrong i was taught to be bad and sneaky but better each time making me eat food off the floor with my mouth to the ground if i dropped anything making me eat huge amounts of food and mocking me just to prove a point that i would eat anything telling my family about my weight issue so that they would secretly take me aside and give me weight loss tips making me do pushups on asphalt when its degrees out spending the night outside for hours because i forgot to take the trash out before bed making me write ten page essays on why i am a bad kid and how i plan to do better without having the tools to do so tying us up in the shed as a scenario in case we were kidnapped but then leaving us there for hours literally dividing me and my younger sister so now were adults who rarely want to talk to eachother having me repeat after him how worthless i am and how a waste of air my mom was i mean he had us repeating a mantra almost everyday im worthless and a waste of air he blended my food in a blender and made me eat it bc i went through a phase where i liked mixing certain foods together he made me feel like i was gross for being a tomboy and made me wear dresses fat shamed me endlessly to the point that i developed an eating disorder always found a new way to insult my existence putting tape on my door when i was grounded so hed know if i left the room grounding me to my bedroom for months at a time taking away my books bc it was the only thing i had left to enjoy and that he hadnt taken away yet gifting me my own things on christmas that hed taken away as punishment before yes teenagers are moody but i was especially bc of how wrong i knew i was being treated ugh i walked on egg shells for most of my adolescence and you have the nerve to tell me i was troubled and gave him a hard time one time i had an anxiety attack so bad that i scratched the shit out of my faceforehead bc i felt so trapped so misunderstood doing pushups for probably the th time that day for something so frivolous he laughed in my face that day making a random nurse check to make sure i was really on my period bc he couldnt believe i ever started bc i was too scared to tell anyone hed tell his friends in front of me how ungrateful i am constantly airing whatever ive done to everyone and anyone like he needed to hear their validations towards how he was treating us bc of our misbehaving and they always gave it to him always hey but at least im independent and have plenty motivation to cut a bitch if needed,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hey guys so for background my mother is a year old fully functioning drug addict with unmedicated bipolar disorder shes on antidepressants but thats about it as far as treatment goes her behavior has increased in abusiveness and she talks and acts like a teenager almost constantly i am a yo female with my own past substance issues and have experienced physical verbal abuse from her my father and past relationships my most recent one ended a few weeks ago and was very violent to the point where i thought id die if i didnt get out she is aware of the severity of abuse that occurred in both of these so after leaving my most recent relationship quite literally the day that it ended i sped home in a full panic attack to ask her to come with me to get my phone and other belongings as my ex had taken them and threatened destruction her exact response to seeing me with strangulation marks in a panic attack was are you sure that even happenedugh well i need a cig and a shower before i deal with this and she did just that after detailing the abuse that i had been silently dealing with she showed a good amount of empathy for me but was condescending about how i was just gonna go back and how she doesnt understand how someone could be weak like me bla bla bla but the real issue is she has now started using the abusive behaviors that i told her my ex used on me she will come at me violently like shes going to hit me or saydo things that i told her hed do to me prior to this she hadnt tried physical violence with me since i was i just dont understand what is making her be like this its heartbreaking shes always made me be her therapist and best friend as im the only girl but now when i give her actual advice that is healthy and not unhinged she flies into a rage and it spirals into a massive argument where she essentially morphs into my ex boyfriends she will quote the exact words ive told her she will take and break my belongings like i told her she will record me after ive become hysterical and she will attempt physical violence on me which she hadnt done in almost years i am fully capable of overpowering her if it came to it and she knows this she always backs down once i make it known that i will defend myself but unfortunately i do always flinch first as its involuntary and ptsd related i just wanna know what could be causing this so i could maybe put a stop to it she keeps pushing my limits and getting more violent im not sure why she wants to put hands on me so bad but i really do not want to hit my mother,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im asking for insight because im unsure if im being abused or not i dont want to tell anyone i know because i fear theyll say that i am from a lack of understanding i am just wondering if whats happening to me is normal and if im just spinning things out of proportion out of selfishness or ungratefulness sorry if this is a lot im years old and living with my mother my mother is a kind and hardworking woman who hasnt stopped working since she immigrated to the us since i was a kid weve had a lot of conflict between us i dont really remember my early childhood but i became suicidal at because i felt like everyone hated me and that i was a burden to my family mostly because i did things my mother didnt like i cant remember what i did at that time but it was related to online activity one event that did stick with me yrs old was when she smashed my phone against the wall because i was watching an animation meme video on it that she thought was stupid what caused her to break my phone was my stepfather engaging in an argument with her that i had provoked by complaining to him after that she drove me and my brother to stay the night at a motel from then on i began contemplating running away from home i grew quieter and more reserved which upset her understandably she wanted to speak with me but i had nothing to say to her whenever i cried she always had to know the reason why regardless if i wanted to keep the reason to myself i remember once i took a shower at am when i was i was binge watching a tv show and lost track of the time and she beat me for showering late it wasnt severe but that did hurt me emotionally i feel like my mother is very controlling over me always judging my friends and my appearance and what i spend my time doing if i speak with a tone or pitch she doesnt like then i have an attitude when i dont smile she tells me to smile and when i do smile inauthentically she gets mad that im faking my smile and starts lecturing me this especially bothers me because when my face is relaxed she imitates my expression by pouting horrifically recently ive been trying to explore my tastes and express myself through my appearance i like alternative clothing and ive been trying to build a more masculine build due to gender dysphoria by working out im nonbinary i cant tell her this so i went shopping for the first time at the mall alone with girls from church this year and bought huge baggy shirts from the male section i come home and she discovers theyre for men because of the tags and yells at me panickily that these are mens clothing she holds up a flannel i got and exclaims its a mens shirt i couldnt defend myself because i froze up but thankfully my brother did and told her that its modern female fashion she then dismisses me to go shower and gets upset about how long i was out at the mall hours shes also allowing me to lift weights but tells me i shouldnt lift so much or else ill look like a man i also cant cut my hair short the way i want to and she hasnt told me why ive stopped arguing with her and become more obedient doing whatever she asks or wants of me i barely ask her for anything now in fear that shell use whatever i want against me but ive developed repressed anger towards her which i feel bad about she also doesnt share my happiness this summer ive spent more time gaming because i finally made friends before i had no friends but instead of being happy for me shed get mad and say that im wasting my summer she would kiss me goodnight and slam my door angrily when i excitedly told her my friend was coming to our church for the first time she scolded me and warned that my friend shouldnt be a distraction i could keep writing but then this post would be the length of a novel in short i just feel like i have no control over my life i grew up sheltered and im still being sheltered today i feel like im not allowed to make mistakes and grow on my own in order to live the least problematic and stressful life i have to bottle up all my emotions and do whatever she says ive lost friends because of this and i fear that ill lose my current friends i just want to leave as soon as possible learn how to drive and get a job to save up for an apartment so i can finally have some autonomy today she picked me up from school and began berating and yelling at me for getting defensive and that i shouldnt get defensive with her because shes my mother i always upset her somehow everyday and its so tiring i just wish i didnt have the ability to think for myself so i could just let her mold me into whatever she wants me to be her ideal daughter so please id like to hear your thoughts is this abuse im dying to know i just want to know if my anger and sadness is justified its killing me thank you,Positive
f id told my friend about my mothers abuse and showed him my post on this account about her basically explaining what she did his mother works at our school for lunch duty i dont think shes a teacher but she seems really kind and he agrees i asked him what if he told her mom and he said she wouldnt be able to just keep it a secret and most likely tell someone and get me help most likely cps which is fine but ive heard horror stories about cps making it worse and not listening to the victim so they just leave which i really dont want to happen nor do i want me or my two year old sister to be sent to our fathers which i suspect may happen to her which i absolutely do not want to happen her father is a weird creep he had year old me in a bathing suit at the beach literally just me it wasnt a family picture as a screen saver for a very long time before my mom told him to change it almost wanna say a year but i cant remember ik it was atleast a few months in a physical fight he bruised my mom and possibly injured her cause she had back problems after that and called the police on her like he isnt the one that bruised her also scolded my mom saying she should hit me more mind you he was my stepdad for a long time if hes willing to say this to my mom because im not his kid imagine what hell do to her said if he had a dog he would shove its nose in its shit while beating it to treat it a lesson sent me red flowers on valentines day my mom had broken up with him a long time before that and he lived in a apartment separate from our house and raped my mom multiple times when they were sharing a bed he would literally just pull down her undergarments without her consent and fuck her while she was silent and just laying there pulled a gun on my mother and aunt while they were literally just having a sibling argument while little me was in the room i also suspect that he might have raped me when i was young before first grade story is my mom left me in the tub to go get my clothes out of the dryer but she fell asleep on the couch while waiting next thing i remember is waking up naked in my bed but the weird thing was that i was absolutely terrified so much so that i frantically ran to find my mother while helping me she went to go ask him about it and she said he was acting really weird and nervous like she could tell his heart was racing weird thing was i dont remember feeling any pain although i could be making up memories imagery wise i know what happened story wise but i mean visuals for example the whole story i imagined it was in my current house i grew up in until my mom told me it happened in our old house in baltimore which so i dont know but another weird thing is that i wet the bed until i was so on that note i also remember that also maybe before first grade when i was little my mom set up a camera in my room while she went to go take a shower because she didnt trust my stepdad around me cause i was so little i dont know the logic around that either but okay and he saw her creep around the corner into my bedroom she jumped out the shower and he scurried into the other room which is weird if he wanted to say good night right i also swear ive seen him stare at my ass going up the stairs as a teenager atleast once the whole reason my baby sis has visitation is literally for control hes manipulative and gaslighty in general he most likely got my mother pregnant on purpose they were together for years and a year after they broke up he got her pregnant even after she told him she wasnt on the pill theyve never had a pregnancy scare mainly because it was a loveless relationship theyd argue after she was born and one day he was like ill see you in court she asked for space after that cause she was tired of seeing him every fucking week but he threw a tantrum after a few months and indeed took her to court he probably doesnt even gaf ab her that much cause when my mom was struggling with money she asked him once for diapers and he acted weird about it so she had to scrape the last of whatever she had to get enough money he makes almost k a year sorry we got a bit off topic there but as you can see why i do not want him or his family dont know them that well but theyre probably weird asf too to take my sister either ill put up with the abuse if i have to to prevent this or going to anyone else in mine because honestly my other family members arent stable either but i dont know if i have a choice i dont know what to do because who else would i go to and forget me what about my sister i dont want anything to happen to her should i tell or just wait it out its already starting with my sister even though she is a bit rowdy and can be really annoying most of the time shes just a baby and when my mom gets irritated she shoves her off of her if shes climbing on her not too hard but enough to make me uncomfortable or snapsyells at her we even argued a bit last week because she said something like my sister is gonna start needing whoopings soon because she acts like a brat and i tried to tell her there are other ways but she just started saying you guys dont listen until i get aggressive im pretty sure im overall a good kid and i dont usually ignore her on purpose i just have adhd forgetful or depression clinical and really bad but this is unacceptable in her eyes and not an excuse like wtf i feel like i could honestly finally heal if i got from this suffocating ass household it could be the source of my depression for all i know other than adhd and honestly i can feel the thoughts of suicide coming back i feel so lost i also dont have any evidence,Positive
hello ive come here to ask for some advice regarding what to do in my situation i have a very strong moral compass but im unsure if doing things the way i want to will bring upon a good result one of my legal guardians is abusive and she physically beats my dog when she is angry at him i have audio evidence of this on my phone i love my dog so much and i know its wrong but i can take the abuse from her but not to our small dog i want to report her to the police how do i do that in a way it cant lead back to me reporting it im scared that if she finds out it was me and she somehow is not convicted that once shes set free she may hurt me im only and i dont know what id do without my dog and being down one legal guardian would be detrimental but i need to do this i dont want my dog to have to suffer anymore,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

okay i f didnt rly think my home life was abusive most of my life mostly due to the fact many of the things happened werent stereotypical of abuse i left about months ago after a physical altercation between my grandpa and me as things have escalated the past couple years so i went to live with my bf and his family for the summer i always remembered bad things about my childhood i had core bad memories such as praying for god to make me an angel at age because i didnt want to be alive anymore but was too young to understand after leaving tho i started remembering a lot of other things from childhood just random moments of wtf how could someone actually do that to a kid or say that for example i randomly remembered my family had taught me by age how to like go to a kill in defense ig but definitely knew a handful of ways to just off someone with my hands or immediate objects if need be they always said or ill remember a random punishment my papa did i started having a reoccurring nightmare most nights the setting changes but its the same theme every time i can never really remember faces or the end or specific details i just wake up feeling really bad if i try to think about it and i have it at least every other night and the memories just keep coming out of nowhere someone says one thing and i just remember and have to sit there for a second comprehending even tho its not rly relevant i looked into what ptsd flashbacks are actually like and i hate using such a severe illness but im starting to think it might have something to do with that has anyone else experienced this after leaving the abusive situation ill just randomly remember things from when i was like w out trying at all and the core ones about memories that i remembered before just keep popping up in my head constantly even tho its been years i remember these ones a lot better,Neutral
can i escape legally i mean im a year old female whos been living with my father since i was hes had sole custody of me pretty much my entire life but recently things have taken a turn for the worst my father was raised quite conservatively and religiously so he raised me the same way but to him mental health is a thing i have manic bpd and i get into depressive episodes often but my fathers solution was to always just get over it and therefore i want to leave ive been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half and weve made plans for me to move out with him into his parents house they are willing to take me in and love me wholeheartedly i honestly cant wait they have always been extremely supportive and mindful when it comes to my situation and mental health all theyve wanted was for me to get out and be happy and join their family and honestly i want to ive been planning my move to join their family but theres two issues that my father has they live practically across the country so hes scared and his family dont expect much from me my father has always had high expectations for me because he knows i can do it but he also sees me as lazy and if i move in im a leech which is quite the opposite my boyfriends parents havent said or mentioned anything about rent but ive offered anyways i even plan on doing online college out there and paying for it myself i have no intention of leeching of them and im far too stubborn to do so anyways but due to this my father has become emotionally and mentally manipulative from saying that i wont make it out there to outright saying ill probably die hell go on and on theres been moments where hell be lecturing me and make me so uncomfortable i hyperventilate and want to vomit he also likes to say im just like him while caressing my shoulders and neck in an almost inappropriate manner i swear its disgusting so much so that theres been times where ive wanted to make him hate me or disgusted by me ive even thought about committing right in front of him to make him suffer but i wont i have too much to live for and a happy life around the corner my only issue is its getting worse and i honestly dont think i can stay much longer i would leave if i were able to but my father recently divorced my mother as part of the contract entails i cant leave my address within miles or else my father will serve time in prison but i honestly dont think theyd arrest him or do anything to me im almost as a matter of fact i turn in less than months im wondering if ill just be able to leave since im so close to being the legal age and the amount of money and time it would take to file the paperwork anyways id already be gone what do you think,Positive
sigh so ive decided im gonna use reddit and specifically this place at a way to journal document whats going on with my dad so i can remember this weekend my dad tried to accuse me of attacking him yea how it whent down was i was cutting open a container of potato soupthe kind from safeway yk the lip of the seal for it just breaks right off so you have to meticulously cut it with sissors do you can get all of the contents out properly minding my own business just tired from having started college the week prior and he had the audacity to walk over and be like your doing it wrong dont use those sissors keep in mind its the only sissors we have in the kitchen and they are old and dull so i make due and the rips them from my grip and starts cutting for me and i ask him to stop and hand me back the sissors and that im an adult and can handle cutting open my own food he continues anyway proceding to cut the plastic film in a way that will make it harder to get the max amount of my moneys worth from the container and i panic so i stupidly grab the sissors from his hand and try to safely pull them from his grip in a way where neither of us would be in danger but it doesnt work because hes a strong man and im not he the gasps and an inch from my face out of nowhere yells on the top of his lungs your attacking me and i let go ack back off not before he grips my shoulder really tight and leaves a red mark that faded after a few hours i immediately shut down and try to stop myself from reacting and crying to no eval because ik giving him a reaction only makes it worse he started antagonizing me saying im dramatic for crying and when i started crying to myself asking what did i even do in a high pitched voice he mocks me calling me micky mouse he kept repeating to me that i need to stop acting like the victim when all i was doing was reacting to how he was acting im lucky i was able to spend the night at my partners house that night because i dont wanna think how exhausting it might have been to stay in that house with him any longer in that moment after staying at my partner me house for a night or two my dad messaged me saying are you doing better and i cant quite tell if that genuine care or antagonistic but regardless it just feels to weird that before that he was acting as if i attacked him and is now asking me if im done done with what i just dont understand regardless hes still thinks hes in the right and its exhausting i wish i had somewhere else to live but just dont and its just driving my already poor mental health into the ground,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

as a kid ages my dad gave us spankings as a punishment but a detail of it really makes me feel weird about the whole thing i know spanking is relatively common but i recently learned online it was usually just a smack or two over a clothed bottom or hand my dads spankings would start with taking off our pants then bending over dad would then hit us between times depending on the severity of the offense sever being something like breaking something or hitting a sibling we did it unclothed because it hurts more on bare skin i understand this is abusive but what kind it gives me a sick feeling to recall and the trauma has caused major blowup arguments between me and partners who are interested in spanking in the sexual sense i go ballistic when its brought up is this normal spanking please help,Positive
so a lot has happened since my last post ive told my father in a text that i know he cheated and abused my mom in every way and i guess since he knows his covers been blown hes been absolutely awful to me i recently paid off my car and the bank sent the title to his address since i didnt change my address on my bank profile and he wont send it to me and tried to convince me that i cant sell the car because he cosigned on it and recently my little brother got his first phone i dont get to talk to him much since im active duty military and hes never had a phone before my father took his phone and blocked me and scared my brother into not speaking to me on top of all that he has the nerve to text me and demand an apology apology for what calling out your actions if he can treat his wife and kids this way imagine how he treats random people how does someone come to be this awful what hurt the most is he doesnt want me part of his family this is the worst heartbreak ive honestly ever felt any advice would be much appreciated,Neutral
i actually hate my mom so much sometimes i love her and sometimes i hate her she was abusive towards me when i was younger and now that i grow up she stopped beating me up but still shes very problematic i dont know how to explain like she sometimes support in fact she has the same mentality as some men she always yells at me for something i really didnt do she force me to clean my brothers room while he is playing on his damn phone and when i ask her to ask my brother to do it himself since its his room she said but youre a girl and hes a man i sometimes wish i was a boy i remember it was one of my biggest dream to be born as a boy when i was younger not in a trans way but maybe if i was born as a boy my mom wouldnt treat me like that in the first place she also used to wake me up by hitting me on the face and the day i started cutting myself and she find out the first idea coming from her mind wasnt to help me but it was to take the knife from my hands and beat me up with it,Neutral
selective amnesia when your mind temporarily forgetsinvalidates abuse youve experienced to lower your stress levelsrisk of trauma while this is a very useful thing my mind does for me i can literally be happy minutes after being yelled at for something thats logically incoherent i forget the seriousness of the situation after im in a better mood almost invalidating or downplaying it this makes it hard to actually find a solution to the problem for context im in foster care and im thinking of asking my social workers to move me placement my foster mum is very emotionally abusive some examples of this are treating a child above everyone when theyre the good kid in order to make the bad kids feel isolated and worse they encourage abusive behaviour from the good kid to their siblings as well in order to further this dynamic another thing she does is uses the completely wrong approach when you make a mistake im talking if you leave one breadcrumb on the side because you didnt notice it she will berate you saying things like when youre in uni no one will put up with this youre incompetent without me and other damaging fixed beliefs instead of encouraging a child to improve in a way that isnt degrading or damaging to their self worth shes also very gaslighting ive noticed recently i started recording her as i kept doubting myself mid convo and she will accuse you of one thing at the start of the argument and when you prove her wrong she will say she actually said something completely different by the end for example sorry if this is tmi she said that i left blood in the toilet and put the cardboard toilet roll in the toilet and called me disgusting for it when i said i wasnt on my period she changed it to a number when i said i didnt do that either she pulled out the toilet roll from the bin and it had a water droplet on it and she acted like thats what she was saying the whole time and that its disgusting and unacceptable now im doubting what shes accusing me of half the time and whether the way shes made me feel incompetent may have been complete lies sometimes when i go to my social workers about this im not triggered anymore and i dont feel that there is a problem despite logically knowing there is i try to tell them i need to get out but dont feel confident enough to defend why as she gaslights and changes the story and i dont have the social competence to counteract this as well as the fear of getting in trouble if i offend her i dont know how to deal with this,Positive

tw sa i f have only told one other person about this and they said it sounded like sa i guess part of me is still coming in acceptance of the possibility that my own mother mightve sad me this happened when i was around years old when i first got my period i wasnt very educated on womens menstrual cycles at the time so i didnt know how to use a tampon let alone where to stick it it was summer time so i would go to day camp at a local park every day to swim my mom said i wont be able to swim with a pad on while on my period and suggested i start using tampons instead i asked my mom how to use one my mom seemed surprised for some reason i honestly thought she was gonna show me like a educational video on youtube or something i didnt think she would suggested putting it in for me i know this is probably just normal but its still felt gross to me she had me set butt naked in the living room on the couch while she tried to shove the tampon in me but it hurt and i started crying saying stop it hurts but she just told me to shut up and to stop being a baby again i cried stop and then she stopped rolled her eyes told me i was crying for nothing and went downstairs i felt so disgusted and embarrassed i felt so embarrassed i didnt talk about it til just this past year thanks to this event i refuse to ever use tampons again,Positive

i was bullied in high school maybe i overreacted by skipping classes a lot to avoid my bullies they found out and just told me to read the bible and pray when it still continues they said im distracting them from their work by my constant bad mood they also said im a burden to the family word for word i swore to myself to never talk to them about my problems again but sometimes i just cant help it and talk to them anyway the next responses are not as extreme as that one but saying the solution is to read bible and pray is a regular thing they love to say recently i move to another country for internship i already predicted that i will not be homesick and missing them at all because whether they are here or not does not change anything sure enough two months in and i dont miss them at all but recently my male roommate im female behaviour troubles me his mood is very dependent on me he will get upset if i dont talk to him one day i told him to not get too close physically and he got upset of course i got scared so i cant help but tell my mom whats happening she said maybe he likes you word for word i think i have learned to depend on myself in most things but there just some moments where i cant handle it myself i dont want to handle things alone but i dont want to burden my friends and i cant ask my family because they will just hurt my feelings even more,Neutral

hello everyone its my first time posting on here and i just need a little guidance i have been bounding between my parents houses since last september when my mom moved out after their divorce was finalized since then my dad previous alcoholic with relapses about once every or months has been treating me far better on a regular basis than he has been this is great for me as its allowed us to bond however when we disagree or argue about anything he jumps straight to the end of the scale screaming name calling berating threatening violence on some occasions he gets minorly physical and its mostly over nothing that concerns him for example tonight i said i was expecting a phone call and he asked from who and i said my boss he then proceeded to fly off the handle about how it wasnt my place to make my concerns known in the workplace because im just an employee we then argued for about or hours on varying subjects of my worth and how i would never amount to anything even close to him this is different to how my mom acts whenever im around her its always some kind of argument usually its over quick and without much to complain about however she tries to pitch a sob story to guilt trip me into her views this is a repeating cycle for me since whenever i argue with one parent the other becomes my friend hoping ill spend more time at their house that week its gotten to the point that i look for excuses to leave the house or go on a drive whether it be to run an errand or two or just to visit my grandparents i dont want to continue to walk on eggshells all the time with my mom or be forced to toe the line and take so much from my dad any advice is appreciated thank you all for your time,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

so six months ago my ex cut me off after a two year long relationship during that time we argued and fought constantly it was awful we both constantly tried expressing our communication needs to each other but never understood its important to note that both of us had emotionally abusive parents this is also a major factor in my depression and suicidal thoughts my father has made good progress on improving himself since my childhood hes definitely not perfect but the difference in the way he talks to me in the past few years is vast my mom on the other hand lately ive been getting into the same huge arguments with her ive been doing my absolute best to remain levelheaded during these arguments and by doing this ive managed to notice something extremely important the way she argues with me is extremely manipulative she gaslights moves goalposts and gets really nasty and it all felt so familiar not just because its the way shes always argued with me but also because its the way i argued with my ex its the way ive always argued with everyone its why ive lost all of my prior friendships and ended up completely alone i realized that i picked up all of her toxic traits and used them to abuse people important to me in the same way ive never felt so awful but its also given me motivation to improve myself and change my ways i want to make efforts to manage my emotions better become a better listener be more constructive rather than destructive and see my loved ones as people i disagree with rather than as my enemies im also planning on further distancing myself from my mother i think this will help with my mental state and personal growth and hopefully it gets my mom to think more before she speaks and maybe i could actually have a relationship with her in the future like i do now with my dad ill never be able to heal the pain i caused my ex and other people i was close to in the past but i can make damn sure it doesnt happen again i will break the cycle of abuse and i wont be defined by my parents mistakes anymore i will rise above,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hey everyone this is my first time posting on reddit and i discovered this forum because i want to find a healthy way to ask for help without trauma dumping people in and being judged for it for some context my narc mom was always physically abusive up until about my senior year of high school because she attacked me so severely that my school got suspicious as to why i came to school late and in tears she did this i wanted to stay home from school for the first time in my academic career because i was so burnt out from my ap courses and preparing for sats and college apps aside from this my sibling recently passed this year which has taken a toll on my family i now go to college in a city about an hour from my hometown and spend this summer taking summer courses internships working and volunteering because of this ive had to stay on campus all summer last week my mother wanted me to visit the family home in time to see some family members i initially agreed but i had a friend who was leaving the country and some of my friends wanted to throw a going away party for him due to scheduling issues we had to have the going away party the day my mom wanted me home early i called her to let her know i would be home late but still in time to see my cousins she began saying you think youre an adult which i am im and other nagging words but she never explicitly said no after she hung up the phone i thought nothing of it and moved on she called me minutes later calling me a whore and she explicitly said youve been on campus for two months im sure guys are rotating through your room and youre giving yourself to guys i was utterly shocked when she said this because ive never had a boyfriend let alone my first kiss and the only time ive spoken to her about guys in my life was to express my disinterest in getting married i kept asking her why she said what she said until she had no choice but to hang up on me i then called her over times because i wanted an explanation for this and have frankly grown tired of her insulting and degrading me and getting away with it i called my father and asked him to pass the phone to her but he refused and told me to calm down i told him what she said to me and he brought up the classic muslim line your mother is your mother you shouldnt even say oof to her which he often does whenever she wrongs me to make me accept the treatment and write it off as the situation not being that bad but this time i couldnt do it i came home that night to confront her but fell asleep after a long workday the next day i waited till both my parents arrived from work and went to their room to confront them i calmly said hello and asked her directly why she said what she said to me over the phone my father told me to leave her alone because she was sick which wasnt true instead of taking accountability for her actions or simply apologizing she starts talking about a paragraph i sent her months before my sibling passed this was a period when i refused to come home during the semester because she called me a btch for accepting a position as vice president of an oncampus club dedicated to cancer research she was upset because i didnt ask her i will attach the paragraph to this post she began yelling calling me disrespectful then lying and saying she never said that my father of course confirmed saying that he didnt hear her say that i stood my ground and said that i wasnt being disrespectful in the paragraph i sent and i wanted to know why she said what she said to me she realized i would not let her get away with this and began screaming for me to go upstairs i refused and she got in my face and slapped me and told me to get the fk out of her house after this i lost it i began yelling at her havent you lost enough and went went upstairs to pack my things my father followed me and blamed the entire situation on me saying that i shouldve let it go and that because she is my mother i should accept whatever treatment she dishes out to me luckily i had a friend who knew about the situation and got me an uber to her place my father wouldnt let me leave so i had to wait until my parents slept to go around am from there i didnt hear from them for five days after which my mother called my job and lied saying that my father was sick and that i did all this i wanted freedom which was especially sinister of her because my dad has a chronic heart condition i decided to call the local hospital and my aunts and uncles to check if this was true it wasnt i maintained no contact but my father kept calling daily demanding i come home at the same time i got a call from the people who cared for my siblings until they passed so i answered when i found time this individual only heard the version of the story my father told and isnt familiar with my mothers true nature he ended up spitting quranic verses and hadiths at me he begged me to apologize to my mother and go home which my father was demanding me to do with the death of my sibling being fresh my hand was forced to call my mother and father and give them a bs apology after this i said i would go home on monday ive been watching a lot of dr ramani to see how to address this situation when i go home i am conflicted about whether i should greyrock my parents at this stage i want my s to be about growth and independence i am aware i have so much life ahead of me and i dont want to be in this toxic family any more than i have to i am also a practicing muslim and this has affected my relationship with the religion and i still wish to maintain being a muslim im sorry about how poorly written this is but im so frustrated about constantly being forced to apologize when im not in the wrong im tired of them using my siblings death to manipulate me because i was now their only hope i am tired of being so at peace when im by myself for people to tell me that i should go back to the hell that is my parents simply because they had a dream that allah was upset with me i dont know how much i can take before leaving this state entirely and cutting ties with every family member i have so much unspeakable rage about this situation and i want to cut them out of my life but i come from a culture that wont let me and a religion that frowns upon that help here is the paragraph i cant add the image hi mommy im sorry ive been very distant with you i really didnt like it when you yelled at me on the phone the day you found out i had a vice president position for the x i was really hurt at the way you insulted me and called me names for something that i did to benefit my application to medical school and make you guys proud you dont tend to be open to hearing other peoples side of the story and it makes it hard for me to want to tell you whats going on because i honestly dont feel like getting attacked which is why i gave you distance because academics are already stressful enough all i ask if for your support and positive advice i dont blame you for anything because i understand that you only want the best for me and im very appreciative but please if you can just be more gentle when youre critiquing me or giving me advice it would go such a long way i also understand if you are still upset with me because not keeping you in the loop isnt acceptable i take full responsibility for that and it wont happen again that was just my way of focusing on what i have in front of me school ill call you this weeke if you dont mind i love you,Positive
i was subjected to extensive physical and emotional abuse as a child along with my siblings more recently some siblings starting piecing together things that indicated there could have been childhood sa too it has always been this way but especially now being around my dad has made me extremely emotionally distressed i either have mini panic attacks before or after the interactions and just so much anxiety overcomes me anytime he calls and leaves me voicemails i am pregnant and just moved in with my boyfriend of years to get ready to welcome the baby and he makes comments that are really disturbing repeating how good i look and keeps begging to see the new place he also always guilt trips me into trying to visit my year old grandmother who i have no connection to whatsoever she was also abusive in childhood very racist in childhood toward me i am in a biracial relationship he has addiction issues and this year his affluence he has gotten him out of yet another dui and he has a rehab experience where i went to a family therapy session where his therapist literally told me to only say good things that he has done for me and talk about how great he is because they use a strengths based model for recovery i feel really unsafe i am in therapy trying to work through all of this but it seems like i cant break down that final wall to work through it with him still around in any capacity i just dont feel safe to talk about it or tap into any emotional material i am thinking for the first time in my years about cutting him off i am the only sibling who really has a relationship anymore but i have never been this distressed to clarify the reason why we cant prove certain types of abuse is because all of us siblings have very broken memories from all the trauma,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my dad claims he went easy on me as a kid and that his spanking were nothing compared to what he got most of the people i know would not consider spanking to be abusive or traumatic its mostly regarded as usual where i am from and even encouraged however i do have a lot of bad memories from my childhood that involved spanking my mother has borderline personality disorder and my father has anger issues spanking and being forced to lie down in my bed and be quiet for time periods that ranged from minutes to hours were the only punishments my parents used on me as a kid my dad spanked me with belts and cheap plastic flyswatters my mom would spank me and my siblings hard with her bare hands many of the spankings i got as a kid did not make sense i remember being scared of my parents and always on tiptoes because it did not take much to earn a spanking i remember periods of my childhood when i was spanked nearly every day i remember my dad spanking me with a belt a bunch of times on my legs and yelling at me when i was four because i accidentally walked in on him and my mom arguing they accused me of eavesdropping on their conversations which resulted in me getting the belt i remember my dad spanking me a bunch of times on my legs with a flyswatter when i was for asking my grandparents for a snack after i had already eaten he was mad at me for wanting food after i had already eaten and for making him look bad i think i have another memory of my mom bathing me when i was nine and she made me get in the shower when it was freezing cold i squealed when the water hit my skin because of the extreme temperature this angered my mom and she slapped me so hard on my butt that her spikey diamond ring cut me and i bled i have several memories of my parents forcing me to get naked from the waist down and spanking me with a belt several times i remember feeling humiliated and afraid i did not like my parents seeing me naked and bent over especially not my dad my parents did this to me for everyday child things i remember my parents spanking me with a belt naked from the waist down in front of both of them and my sister because i put shampoo in my dolls hair and lied about it because i was afraid of being spanked by my parents they did this to me another time because i put a potato in the cats litter box to pretend it was poop and prank my grandpa that his cat took a giant poop they would also did this to me once because they heard me complain about a chore my parents wanted to spank me naked from the waist down to make it hurt more and to see the redness from the belt forming on my bare butt they may have also done it to humiliate me most of the spankings i got as a kid did not result in injuries besides redness on my skin however i can remember at least three occasions where i had welts or broken skin from a harsh spanking on my legs i remember having welts on my legs from getting whipped with a hickory switch i remember another time when i had welts from the plastic flyswatter i remember one time my mom stripped me naked from the waist down or it was fully nude i cannot remember but she spanked me so hard that i screamed and cried from the pain and humiliation i could not sit without pain for two days but i had no bruising that i can remember just a lot of redness that lasted days,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i f am getting married in january and i am trying to decide if i should let my mother come my hesitation to invite my mom is due to concerns that she will yet again choose her husband over me so therefore if i want her to come her husband has to come to which i dont want because when i was younger my moms husband would abuse me verbally and physically this caused me to fall into a deep depression and have body dysmorphia he would constantly sexually exploit and even though i had proof of this and would constantly come to my mom for help she would always tell me that i was lying and would never take my word for it now that years have passed since this has happened i have tried to have a relationship with my mom and i really want to especially now that im getting married i want her i be in those moments you need for like going wedding dress shopping and helping put into it on my wedding day i just want to have my mom at my wedding but she continues to choose him over me and proceeds to tell me that ive been lying all these years about what has happened now i cant decide if i should let the past be the past and be the bigger person even though i have yet to receive an apology and yet to be told that she believes me and just let them come to my wedding or should i be petty and not invite them,Neutral

i apologize in advance for my grammar im swedish and english is my second language also im new to reddit sorry for any errors i really need some relationship advice aita if i ask my father for a paternity test my f mom f seriously dropped the ball on me this year we have always had a strained relationship to summarize my mother are very immature and narcissistic when i was a child my parents went through a really destructive divorce there was accusations of grape my abusive father selling explicit pictures of my older sisters to those kind of people my equally abusing mother developing mnchhausen by proxy and lots more i ran away from home at and havent lived with any of my parents since ive been in therapy off and on all of my adult life and had the chance to work though most of the trauma or so i thought at years old i moved with my husband to the literal other side of the country and have since lived a calm and happy life im the only sibling of who keeps in contact with both our parents depending on life its been more or less contact but at the start of this year i spoke with my mother on the phone a few times a week mostly about day to day life i usually put her on speaker and let her talk about her dramas while i did household work or walked the dog one reason being that she then usually didnt bother my siblings too much because she got the attention she needed from me in february mom told me she met someone lets call him k i was surprised her last relationship was over years ago with a man who tried to groom me and my sisters she was somewhat secret about this new man until she suddenly got a cancer scare on a mammogram appointment it turned out to be nothing but she decided to spill a huge secret that the man she started to meet is supposedly no dna test done yet my oldest sisters f father who weve never heard of before weve known all our lives that my oldest sister had another father lets call him m but suddenly my super prude mom starts introducing k to my siblings the ones who still live in her town my twin sister who is a bit of a detective starts to research the guy and find out that he and mom went to nursing school together in the late s he lives in the next town over is married and have adult children which my sister tells mom who in turn asks him about his wife k tells my mom that he lives with his wife and theyve tried to divorce for years but due to super mysterious circumstances they never succeed my mom delusional as always decides to believe his quite obvious lie and continues to openly date him during this time i keep contact with mom and im stupidly enough trying to be some voice of reason for her but i fail miserably i tell her i wont judge her for looking for love but she at least shouldnt lie to herself he is married and if she choose to believe his lies its on her mom then asks me to contact ks wife and ask her if k is lying and i refuse to because me doing that seems bonkers to me my oldest sister just dont care about all of this and keeps her distance to both of them fast forward to june k and mom decide to drive all the way down to my county about hours drive to visit family for a mini vacation not visiting me and hubby because i really dont want a man i dont know to stay the night at my house and i tell mom as such instead we agreed to meet at a relatives house about hours drive from my place mom is really excited for me to meet her new catch that fateful morning i got in the car and drove over my hubby had work to do so i went alone and the moment i step inside that door itsweird my mom who usually cant leave me alone just sits at the kitchen table and doesnt even get up to greet me she almost looks close to tears k does get up and give me a brisk handshake i think nothing special of him he looks and talks just like any man ive met and im not shocked that he didnt turn out to be that m tall strong harlequin romance cover photo man my mom described all year our relative my moms cousin makes us delicious crepes and i exchange pleasantries with her and her husband in the corner of my eye i see k and mom running back and forward from the kitchen to the guest room barely saying two words to me when we sat down to eat he just makes two super sexist and awkward jokes which me and the relatives didnt laugh at because eeeeew and then he storms off i decide that enough is enough thanks my moms cousin for lunch and begin to leave k rushes to put on his shoes before i do which feels odd and when i get to my car he and my mom are on the front lawn obviously arguing i dont stay but i pull off a bit down the road and text her asking if everything is ok and if she needs me to pick her up she may have hurt me a lot in life but ill be damned if i leave someone to be abused she never answered that text i stop briefly again and call my twin sister to calm my nerves and she suddenly tells me that she can see my mom on google maps moving north with her location theyd had to start driving from my moms cousin the same second i did then i get a text from my oldest sister who asks if anyone knows whats going on so to conclude a long story the day my mom and k left moms house someone had sent a letter to his wife when she received it she called him obviously furious and he rushed home with my desperate mother in tow i was furious too i had been so worried about her when they just took off like that when i spoke to mom again i asked her why they did that and she gave me a bs excuse of ks son having some gambling habit and they had to go save him me and my siblings are convinced that my mom sent that letter but it doesnt matter what i ask my mom she wont tell me the truth so for my mental health i dont ask her anymore i understand that he was so disrespectful to me when we met was because he knew about the letter then and assumed that i had sent it the letter his poor wife got was horrible my oldest sister got a photo of the thing from k so obviously ive seen it too and it is basically a hand written note that translates to something like you should know that your husband is with my mom im very protective of my mom are you still married included in the envelope was a badly printed divorce paper im so so angry with my mom i cant describe it ive been angry sad and disappointed with her many many times especially when i ran away from home at but nothing compares to this ive set up and had a few appointments with a therapist but its slow work i just dont know how to handle this all my childhood traumas just hurricaned back into my body and i have the worst sleep paralysis and night terrors ive worked for years to have a civil relationship with her and she just throws me under the bus like this i feel like im questioning too much at the moment when my twin sister came to visit me the subject arose about our own parentage are our dad really our dad mom is adamant that he is but she presumably kept quiet about k for years and we would really want to do a dna test with our dad but my dad is super abusive to my siblings not me im his golden child when getting the chance and i really really dont want to subject them to that i dont know how to ask for a test without having to explain whyand if i do im afraid hell turn his attention to my oldest sister and if he isnt my dadwas all that horror of my childhood just i dont know please if anyone out there got any advice i really need it right now,Positive

often got really violent one memory i have is them arguing while i was at a friends house i heard yelling and things breaking in the kitchen so i went to see what was happening i turn into the kitchen to see my father choking my mother against a wall luckily my friends father stepped in and got him off of her and the police was called i was about the arguments and the violence continued they eventually separated and a while after that i was at home with my mother she was helping me with my homework and there were knocks at the door we looked to see and it was two police officers she said to ignore them so i did but they kept knocking more and more it was scaring me so i went to the bathroom to get away and when i came out of the bathroom the police officers had my mom on the floor of the living room and she was fighting back they kept tazing her over and over until she was down and they put her into the back of a police car my father showed up and took us away turns out he called the police on her for dv they eventually officially got a divorce starting the years and years of custody battles and what my mom called the war but my mom had us practice what we were going to say and the abuse that happened but my father kept fighting for custody no matter what my mom brother and i all legally changed our last names when i was so that we didnt have the same last name as him and we moved across the country once i turned my mom seemed so happy saying that he finally couldnt fight for custody i hadnt seen my father since i was years old and i havent had any contact with any extended family on either side because of my mother and when we moved i thought everything was fine until i finished high school and moved away i joined the military i then came out to my mom as bisexual and told her i had been questioning my gender i thought shed be supportive i was very much wrong about that she told me i wasnt allowed home that shed kill herself because of me she then told me she threw out all of my personal items my stuffed animals and my artwork she also had my birth certificate and title to my car and said she wont give it to me unless i let this go and i told her i would not a week after i came out my friend took me on a hike to cheer me up and on the hike lost his footing and fell off a foot cliff i called and directed the first responders to his body he was paralyzed from the waist down i didnt know who to call after that and i needed to talk to someone so i called my mom and she told me that it was my fault you shouldnt have been doing something stupid its your fault your friend is hurt i hung up i then didnt speak to her for a while i didnt speak to her for months actually i attempted to kill myself twice took sleeping pills it was the lowest i had ever felt and then i was sent on my first deployment i wanted to go anything to not be where i was and honestly the deployment was shit but it was what i needed no contact with the outside world i came back and i continued the no contact with my mother not talking to her honestly felt like a breath of fresh air it was like feeling happiness for the first time until i started getting messages from her the messages were all over the place antitrans articles her telling me how horrible i am and then begging me to come back every single message broke my heart all over again and brought me right back to the dark place i had gotten out of and then i got news that my family cat was sick and dying and i called her to say goodbye cause i loved that cat to pieces and honestly that conversation went so nice it was the first conversation in years that we had that we didnt end up in an argument it gave me hope that we could have a normal relationship but i was being deployed again so i couldnt have consistent contact on top of she refuses to apologize for what happened she said she will not apologize for something she thinks is right and that she thinks this lgbt stuff is mental illness and shes not going to support that or apologize for hurting me so i told her that i would need an apology before i think about having a relationship with her again she refused and so i went back to not being in contact with her i occasionally still get emails about how im horrible and ungrateful and how she wished she never had me and how shell kill herself because of me and then she calls me i decided to pick up for some reason and she yells at me for an hour and a half straight saying i needed to let this go and how dare i throw away this family that she is still my mother and i needed to talk to her and then she said something that i havent been able to get out of my head she said i shouldve left you with your father if i knew you would turn out like this and instantly i was just dumbfounded and i said you wouldve left me with an abusive father she said yes that he would have never hurt me i hung up i remember the abuse he inflicted upon her and the abuse also was directed at me and she wouldve left me with him if she knew i was queer i then went on a little self investigation found him on facebook and found years and years of posts about me and in these posts he says that i was brainwashed by my mother to believe he was abusive that my mother was a narcissist who brainwashed me against him at this point i dont know what to believe i am years old its been years since i last saw my father its been years since i saw my mother currently not in contact with either of them should i talk to my mother under the but shes still my mother idea but then wouldnt the same apply to a father and what happened in the past the abuse or was it all a lie made by my mother i left a lot of details out cause its already really long but you get the idea,Positive
my father was very abusive up until when i was and then he left with no words my mother was only verbally abusive during this period but her abuse was very light compared to my fathers and i feel like i could kinda tell it was not really sincere and she never meant to hurt me still did though now i am almost done with college and whenever i am home she is always relatively nice but i still feel anxious around her and cant make conversation and i even find myself always sitting in a different room than her to avoid her she really hasnt done anything bad in the past year and i cant get over the past in my head i make up terrible scenarios in my head and i am so defensive when i am home but when i am at college i feel fantastic almost as if i can forget i was ever abused in the past why is this i want a normal relationship with my mother now i feel like the biggest part of my resentment toward her is the fact that she never talked about what happened with my father when he left you would think a normal person would mention that but she completely ignored it meanwhile i suffered the consequences and had to suffer in silence can anyone help,Positive
may i just start this out by saying my dad is the biggest college freak i know i vividly remember telling him excitedly that i wanted to go to art school and pursue a career in script writing and animation as i had fallen in love with a show called gravity falls when i was younger that deeply inspired me for the next three hours after that he would lecture me and tell me how art school would turn me into a stripper begging for money i understand its an unrealistic dream but i was in middle school barely even thirteen now as of recent i might have dug my own grave here i have always been an ab student sometimes i get all as but then just a b in math and its been like that my whole life up until my junior year which plummeted my unweighted gpa down to a i never told my parents this they know i practically flunked math but they only know that my gpa weighted is a so theyre pleased before i proceed i just want to say my parents have high expectations of me my mom went to nyu and my dad went to duke both as immigrant students we arent rich btw every time i say this everyone assumes im a legacy whos parents are able to donate millions of dollars to institutions when in reality we barely get by and i obviously have yet to live up to all of that my original plan was to raise my marking period one or semester one grade to help my gpa prior to early admissions which my dad wants to help me apply to the only thing is i just found out this isnt possible since early admissions happens before semester one ends im so fucked and i know this is only months away but i can already feel the beating my father is going to give me and im so scared i can hardly speak i can feel him digging into my hair and hitting me and i just want to sob and hide i dont know what to do,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my parent has been physically and verbally abusive to me and my siblings once almost sending my little brother to the hospital nosebleed hes the one who taught me how you roll a blunt he didnt give me the drug and how to take advantage of other people and how to charm them but he acted out of anger towards us hes still my dad though he is not angry all the time he doesnt act like this on a daily bases he used to be like this these days hes kind i can tell that hes getting older and weaker but its killing me i feel guilty for even calling him abusive even though technically he very much so was it makes me feel even worse when he talks about buying us stuff like yesterday he showed me something very expensive and i suspect he might actually buy it for me i just feel guilty for my resentment sometimes i keep telling myself at least you have a father not everybody has that my father didnt have one either he is trying his best i feel like an ungrateful brat am i ungrateful i have parental controls on my phone so ill delete this pretty soon,Neutral
soo i was living at my brothers place for summer holidays because i couldnt stand living with my mum there are around people inside a bedroom house not counting me and two of those people dont even work and do nothing in the house and one of them even threatened to hit me he even almost slammed a door in my face once but i dodged it this has been happening to me four a couple of years i always tell my mum but nothing changes soo thats when i decided to move to my brothers place just to relax on summer holiday i stayed there some weeks and i asked my mum if i could live there we had a discussion i told her she didnt care about me cuz if she did she would actually change things inside the house and she didnt let me live there soo i went back home a couple of weeks later and as soon as i stepped inside the house i just had a full blown panick attack i was crying and shaking and just couldnt talk to anyone my mum got mad cuz i wasnt answering her and she just started hitting me and then she passed out and woke up min later long story short everyone was blaming me for this and no one even asked if i was ok and if i needed help they just started swearing at me for making her pass out and now i will need to support this hell hole until im im just venting thx if you actually read it,Neutral
hello so im m with long hair for reference my reddit avatar pretty much has the same hair i decided to start growing it about a year and half ago because i just like it better but it has been constant struggle with my parents i had to make many compromises because they kept telling me stuff like cut it just once more because we have to go to x and later you can just leave it be but that was just a lie i refused to make compromises anymore and my parents became even more enraged especially my father last night my father got drunk and threw temper tantrum at me berating me for having long hair and told me that hell stop my allowance until i cut it because in his words i bust my ass working for you and you cant even cut your hair for me thats it you wont get a penny more and now i dont know what to do i love having long hair but im unemployed student and i cant afford that,Neutral
this is a bit long but i want to vent here rather than continuing to talk about it with my spouse my mom has been abusive to me for my entire life i have a halfsister i was raised with as well and my mom never treated her the way she treats me anyway my mom had a huge abusive blow up toward me and my spouse last year and ive avoided her since she reached out last year and i told her exactly why i didnt want to spend time with her and she turned it around on me and basically defended being abusive shes been asking me to meet for lunch for over a year and ive declined each time she asked again a few days ago and i said no she then asked me to send her a letter outlining why i want nothing to do with her and that she thinks someone is trying to mind control me into not talking to herlol ive had enough of her ive been in therapy four about three years now i tried going when i was but the therapist suggested i share an article about gaslighting with my mom and when i showed my mom she flipped out and threatened me so i wasnt able to share all of the trauma i had endured from her with the therapist because i was scared and still trying to get on my feet as an adult anyway my mom is the biggest karen for lack of better word she loves reporting people writing her congressman speaking to the manager reporting people for breaking the law etc so after her text i told her i would be happy to type up a letter with all of my grievances and have it notarized and file it with our local county courts so she could reference it if she had further questions which i am actually still considering doing i typed up and sent an email outlining most of the instances of abuse i could remember and identified all illegal instances and emailed it to her which was very liberating afterward i blocked her from all accounts phone numbers etc and i told my spouse i will take legal action against her if she continues to contact me ive had enough of her gaslighting me she would tell me i deserved the abuse and made her do it and if i told people what she did that they would wonder what i did to make her behave that way zero sense of personal responsibility if she wants to continue to play dumb which is one hundred percent the case because she talks of concerns of child abuse for others which is insane because she is a quintessential abuser then i will play with her sending the email made me feel liberated there is way worse stuff that i didnt include but will include if she continues to try to mess with my head ive went on so long not writing down or reporting the abuse to anyone but my therapist or friends my mom loves to start paper trails whenever someone does something she doesnt like so i decided to give her a dose of her own medicine and it actually feels amazing and empowering i want to add that i dont recommend anyone who isnt completely out of an abusive situation with a parent and can support themselves to do this because it could lead to retaliation but in my case im not afraid of her anymore and im not afraid to share what shes done,Positive
hello there ive kept quiet about the hell ive been through for the longest time but today im done staying silent im the oldest of two children and im gay male on the autism spectrum these things shouldnt matter in a loving family but they made me a target in mine over the past five years my mother has systematically torn me apart it started smalllittle digs at how i didnt listen to instructions or too sensitive shed put ideas in my head that i was the problem that i was broken somehow it was always subtle but it was there like a splinter under my skin but it didnt stop there my mother also made me believe that my father was the abusive one in our family shed tell me stories heavily exaggerate situations and twist things to paint him as the villain as a kid i didnt know any betteri trusted her i grew up thinking my dad was the reason our home felt so tense that he was the one to fear but after my parents divorced everything changed without him around her true nature became impossible to ignore suddenly i saw her for who she wasthe one who was always in control always pulling the strings the more distance i got from my dad the more i realized he wasnt the monster she made him out to be he had his flaws sure but he wasnt abusive it was her all along she was the one who used manipulation fear and guilt to keep me under her thumb she turned my world upside down and for so long i didnt even see it to make things even worse im pretty sure she never really understood me being gay at all when i came out to her she didnt ask how i felt or try to understand what i was going through instead she turned it around and made it about herself like she always did she acted like my being gay was something that happened to her something that disrupted her life it was just another excuse for her to play the victim to make everything revolve around her needs her feelings her damn world thats exactly who she isa narcissist through and through as time went on the abuse escalated shed complain constantly that i never did things the right way if i didnt understand something immediately or needed extra time to process it shed lash out instead it was like living with a ticking time bomb i never knew what would set her off and when it did shed unleash all her frustration on mephysically emotionally mentally there were times i was genuinely scared for my life times i thought if i dont get out now i wont make it the emotional abuse was the hardest to endure she knew exactly how to twist the knife making me doubt myself my worth and my right to exist as i am shed tell me i was a burden that my struggles were my fault that i was lucky she didnt throw me out i started to believe her i started to think maybe i was the problem maybe i didnt deserve better there were nights id lie awake thinking about ending it all i came closetoo closemore times than id like to admit but somehow i held on even when every part of me wanted to give up i couldnt let her win i couldnt let her destroy me completely she was like this even before the divorce happened it took hitting rock bottom for me to realize i needed to get out im on a selfhealing journey now one step at a time its extremely hard and some days i still hear her voice in my head telling me im worthless but im learning to drown it out with my voice telling myself that i am enough that i deserve peace that i deserve to heal whats helping me most right now is my music im a musiciana composer conductor and entrepreneur im working on building my own orchestra in my hometown creating something beautiful out of all this pain music has always been my refuge my way of expressing everything i couldnt put into words now its my way of healing every note i write every piece i conduct is a step forward in reclaiming my life its what keeps me going what makes me believe that i can find happiness again this post is my way of breaking the silence of taking back my power to anyone whos gone through something similar i see you youre not alone you deserve better we all do you are valued your feelings are valid you are worthy thank you for reading my story much love,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
for so long i thought i wasnt being verbally abused and its still hard to accept first i found it hard to consider differences between parentchild arguments to parentchild verbal abuse and then to accept that verbal abuse can occur in many different ways not just full emotional neglectabandonment my mother was verbally abused by my father for a long time and i never really gaged it but she has told me that now he cant abuse her divorced that this will now go onto me background about me is im f and that i have anorexia for which i was hospitalized two years ago for healthy weight now and to this day it makes different things very hard for me that would seem totally unrelated ie travelling and going on vacation having normal routines functioning in basic day to day activities when i have bad body image my father comments on my food intake to this day and its never to do with eating too little its more thats unhealthy or no thats too much so i havent felt confident to properly explained how things are difficult for me but have clearly said repeatedly that some days i cant do some things and that is unfortunately that and its not because im being stubborn or inconsiderate but when it comes to these situations i am met with verbal abuse the most recent example being that we are about to go on holiday for a week with grandparents and cousins which is a privilege may i preface but i asked if i could come one day later than planned due to feeling genuinely ill and already unsteady having just come back from somewhere else i offered to pay for new flights and transfers my self i was met with you dont care about other people you wont be able to start university next year because i wont pay for this is you come a day later if you do this then i dont want to see you for a long time man up sometimes you have to do this you dont want to do you are incredibly selfish you wont be invited to anything i bet your friends dont do this for hours on end with him shouting done the phone and me crying on the other end its so exhausting i have said that this day would make such a difference for me and he said he didnt care whether i was happy or not on the trip but it was for everyone else writing this i feel silly as i realise i am so privileged to still have my grandparents go on multiple holidays a year and be able to hopefully attend a university but he gets me in such a state of stress guilt and upset that i cant engage in it anymore i guess making this post im looking for support or validationt that it is verbal abuse but if you had a different opinion im of course open to hearing it,Positive
i am a f and have five siblings brothers and sister my parents are both doctors and my two oldest brothers are in college to become doctors my parents have always pressured me to do well in academics and want me to take over their practice when i am older with my two oldest brothers i have been told i am smart but i really dont feel like it my parents are always disappointed in me and this whole situation has given me really bad anxiety if i disagree with anything my mom says she will hit me then she will tell me its all my fault and honestly i feel like it is it might help to say that it is more my mom then my dad and most of the time i will get into trouble its just her getting mad at me i have tried to just not show emotion when she hits me but it hurts physically and emotionally i have thought about suicide multiple times but each time my friends got me not to and i have talked to the hotline as well the only coping mechanism i have is to hide and do sh i dont know what to do if anyone has any advice i would really like it,Positive
hello i m feel stuck and miserable after my dad yelled at me while seated next to me when i was driving him to the station he later succeeded to have me feed him cake on his birthday which was days after he yelled at me despite my decision to not see him english isnt my first language but i will try my best for context i have a missing tooth and i went to consult a dentist the dentist suggested treatments which are braces and a dental implant i was convinced because my previous meetings with other dentists suggested i remove tooths and braces which i disagreed however i dont have money i am a full time student ever since i was a child i always turned to my mom if i wanted something i dont ask my dad because he makes me feel guilty for asking him to buy things we are a middle class family i learned to be considerate when asking for anything when i was i played alot of video games and i used to ask my mom to buy me playstation my mom told me to ask dad i asked dad and he said he will buy me only if i do well in the exams which i did my dad went to the shop alone and bought playstation cuhz it was cheaper i told him this is not what i asked for and he replied he didnt know about technology and i should be grateful and started comparing me with my sisters and the girls in my school for not having a playstation they dont play video games so they dont need one ever since then i only ask my mom everything eventhough she will tell me to ask dad the problem is my dad always accuses my mom of spoiling me yells at her resents her and gives her the silent treatment thus my mom needs his approval if she were to buy any gadget for me when i was i did well in the exams again and asked her for a tablet she told my dad and my dad agreed but was reluctant my mom bought a tablet for me and i spent hours on it daily i learned alot from the internet and the games i played my dad yells at me and mom occasionally bcuhz of my tablet addiction my mom does shopping for me my dad is reluctant when shopping and would want to go home and leave unpleasant remarks as to why we take so long my mom does shopping for him as well it is apparent that my dad doesnt want to participate when it comes to fulfilling my wants as a child even if he does it he will do it reluctantly or asks me to do well in school only for him to spend minimally as possible my dad doesnt talk it through with me either i understand its his money and he can do whatever he wants with his money but why say yes and do it reluctantly later he isnt genuine and i feel like im eating his money away for my own pursuit why isnt he happy to see me happy my mom was happy why cant he he yells at me whenever i spend too much time on the tablet or if i misbehave and it took a toll on my mental health i started to stay silent more my mom passed away her passing crushed the whole family as i was growing up watching my dad yell at her when its about me i started resenting him he also abused her verbally but thats a different story i resented him alot after my moms passing i couldnt stay with him and i pleaded to stay in my grannys house they agreed i did well in school now i dont see my dad anymore but my dad does the groceries and will visit my grannys house he still has contact with me fast forward to i didnt learn my lesson i dont have mom so i asked my dad to fund the treatment he suggested to go to a family friend dentist but it was far and i insisted to see this one he reluctantly agreed my father is retired he took a hour public transport to my place and i brought him to the dentist the dentist explained to him the pricing it was about rmk for both treatments i was afraid my dad couldnt afford it my dad said to not worry and do one treatment first before moving to the second however we have to meet the specialist dentist to finalize the price before having the treatment my dad said i wasted his day for bringing him to a general dentist i wasnt aware about the procedures i was ignorant but why cant my dad see that im trying he always point my flaws but never praise me for trying i felt disgusted with myself i realised at that moment that my dad doesnt want to fund me anymore i am like a burden to him when i ask him for anything and my childhood is proof i thought of applying to a part time job then since i am burdening him he disagreed saying that it will be hard to follow up classes and the job i agree with him but why he couldnt see that i want try later in the car he told me to not on the ac immediately as it can crack the hot windows i lowered the windows and he still insists to not on the ac the ac was hot since the weather was hot how will it crack the windows i got so angry i bursted at him no matter what i do its always not good enough me u always find fault in whatever i do and i feel invalidated by my own father the flaw is always the first thing u see and say i dont want to listen to ur opinion on whatever i do anymore he yelled at me dad then whats the point of me being a father if i cant have an opinion in what i do opinion is something not right or wrong you dont listen to it but i can tell my opinion i only asked u to lower the windows instead of saying ok ill do it dad u talk unnecessarily what for u ask me to come to the dentist if u dont want my opinion look at the car its so dirty u dont even have time to clean the car me u can have a opinion but everytime u give one its invalidating its very discouraging to hear and it hurts me alot im telling u it hurts me but why do u keep doing it i dont want to listen to ur opinion life has been hard for me im struggling here with uni and my feelings i am human i have feelings but the car is more important i am like a robot to u to wash the car and go to school while pushing aside my emotional needs dad bloody i bought the car with my blood and sweat its my money ofc i have an opinion on this car u dont talk about feelings when u disrespect me u called me idiot for being computer illiterate he didnt know how to log out my account in the family pc instead he deleted all my chats permanently but he uses whatsapp for years already now u called me fker too i wanted to clean my room the day after tmr as i was tired but he didnt respect it instead he forced me out embarrassed me infront of my sis and took away the mattress i couldnt sleep i felt violated and i turned violent and started cleaning the room despite feeling tired doing what he wants not what i want living my life for his like i dont matter i hurt my limbs but i still cleaned the room with all the pain he yelled so loud when saying that i was so scared he would hit me as i was driving the car i thought i would die there and then me u are giving me reasons to disrespect u u think i like being like this saying nasty things u brought this to urself u only care about urself and invalidate me so how can i still respect u we argued more and i left him to the station i told him im not coming back home his birthday was days after our fight he told my aunt and uncle his brother that i didnt come back home for his birthday dinner his brother called me and urged me to come back home as my aunt cooked lunch for me and it will go to waste my aunt gave me and ultimanium that if i dont go back she wont cook for me again i went back home reluctantly i got to know my dad told them i give him a hard time they told me to apologise and wish him birthday or they wont talk to mewill beat me during the dinner i didnt wish him at first they got upset and gave me the stares to wish and apologise during cake feeding ceremony i did dishonestly my dad was happy i felt disgusted of him i lost respect for him i didnt want to see him he gets away with everything i dont blame him entirely his environment is filled with enablers to boost his ego he looks like a narcissist to me i wanted to go back to uni so badly after the party i didnt look back at him after the whole incident i decided that i dont want the dental treatment he is right i am leeching off from him its his money he can do whatever he wants with it but i dont understand why he agrees to spend for me when he is reluctant why cant he say no i feel disgusted living from his money i hate myself i am applying for part time jobs now i learnt that he is not happy seeing me happy the hard way he is in victimhood he wont take accountability nor address his part i had to apologise to him for feeling invalidated and for having my own feelings and not in favour to his feelings i have to play the bigger person altho he is years older than me his whole environment thinks that way too all because he has money and he funded my life i feel so disgusted on how u can get excused because u have money even in fatherson relationship i dont want to build any relationship with money as a basis i want genuine feelings of connection and respect i have rights to be respected as a human being that is taken away by my own family,Positive

one of the many things that makes me fight or put me in situations with my parents is when my dad calls for me and i cant even ask why he just expects me to obey without hearing the reason its always been something that annoy me and an hour ago it happened again but this time i didnt budge and my dad came up to me and hit me while saying that when he calls for me i should just obey without question i genuinely dont know if im just a stubborn dumbass or im right,Neutral
when i yo was a teen i lived with both my parents and both were abusive my dad was much more explosive than my mum yo and it was so difficult to cope that i became cold angry and antisocial with my parents when i look back at my teenage actions and behaviours a lot of them were shitty i used to criticise my mum a lot for things that were invalid like the music she used to listen to or how she dressed and i think some of it was learnt behaviour or resentment as she used to ridicule me as a child i still struggle with reacting in the best and healthiest way but i have come a long way since then my actionsbehaviours have improved and im a different person to my teenage self now she has always had abusive behaviours but its been getting much worse these past several months i dont think she even realises that this is a likely reason for why she behaves so poorly towards me,Neutral
kinda just a rant this is only the tip of the iceberg to what my father did to me but as i get older i see more of how fucked up this is naming a kid jezebel the amount of times ive had people look disgusted upon hearing it call me a slut as a year old ive had people laugh in my face when they heard his excuse was he heard a prophecy that i would reclaim the name jezebel but like seriously you didnt think that through not only am i not a slut im fucking ace if youre reading this gabe fuck you,Neutral
really long ass post i dont remember much about my childhood for some reason my brain did the opposite of a defence mechanism and deleted most of my happy memories they only come to my mind when others tell me about it or similiar experiences i remember most of the bad stuff tho my mother has always been aggressive to me im f and my sister f she hit us often i remember a couple of times her grabbing us by the hair and dragging us around my sister was definitely more in trouble than i was since she didnt study this was happening in elementary school she hit us if we made a mess mess could also mean not making the bed right leaving toys around accidentally breaking something exc she hit me when i talked about things i wasnt supposed to when i was yo i talked at the dinner table with my uncle about my grandma not knowing that they had an argument later i asked my mum if she could come with me to the bathroom and when we got there she hit me quite often during functions she would take me to another room to scold mehit me hitting usually meant slapping in these superficial situations that one time who stuck with me the longest was when in third grade i didnt finish my maths homework and the next day when my mother found out that it wasnt done the teacher didnt even see it she grabbed me by the ear dragged me to my room where she slapped me bit me pinched me pushed me to the bed where she continued to beat me up for a few minutes i dont remember her leaving any bruises or if she said anything at all she then locked me in my room for the whole afternoon she used to do that a lot she would also scream at us and call us names stupid and stuff like that sometimes she threatened us to kill us and other times she threw stuff at us i remember her hitting me in the neckhead with a wooden spatula while i was in a fetal position she mostly stopped hitting us at about yo btw nor me or my sister ever threw any tantrums nor asked for things we were really polite and never talked back i also remember her forgetting me at school birthday parties or other activities sometimes shed pick me up two or three hours late she still does that she used to put a ton of academic pressure on me if i got an a so even if i made one mistake shed tell me that i should study more and that im lazy exc also she is really contradictory sometimes shed say that the most important thing was me to get perfect grades sometimes that it was to clean around the house sometimes shed say that i didnt need to clean around the house and that i just needed to have a clean bedroom once i mentioned this to her and she said that i had to be perfect in everything all this made me develop sh and suicidal tendencies i also attempted multiple times this happened from to over the time she became less strict but the damage was done and i was obsessed with perfection she found out about sh in srry i cant remember and never mentioned it to me in she made me cut contacts with my bestfriend bc she wasnt popular she made me hang out with the popular kids in elementary and middle school but they hated me and spread rumors in i was tired of the daily suicidal thoughts and my mother was well aware of them i distinctly remember that after an argument about an unrelated stuff while i was going to my room she said yeah right go cut yourself in a sarcastic manner she never apologised for anything at all shed buy us clothes instead anyways in i begged my mother for a therapist she brushed me off in august i called cps they didnt do much but now my mother was forced to bring me to a therapist after about a year i was diagnosed with severe depression and ocd when the therapist suggested antidepressants my mother refused and didnt take me there anymore so i dont have a certificate for ocd nor depression but i know i have it my parents and i had a huge argument when i called cps and i still kind of regret it and feel guilty about it but id probably been dead for a while now if i didnt call them to this day i hate my mother she doesnt tolerate mistakes from september to june she lived in another city for work reasons and only came in weekends my sister isnt any better tho theyre the same my sister sometimes hits me and she said that im ruining her life my sister and my parents are aware of the diagnosis but they dont believe in it nor acknowledge it most of my friends are sorry for me but at the same time my generation me included is really weak and always talks about trauma i also know some people who have really strict parents like taking phones and stuff my parents always let me hang out at any time and have very few rules btw im slowly getting better so i dont need any advice and even if im the one exaggerating i plan to go nc with her but my mother never asks me if im alright she tells me to stop crying if im crying and sometimes she doesnt even notice if im crying beside her still i know other kids who had it wayy worse than me so i feel a little bad,Positive

i have never thought of my parents as abusive before they argue with me and my sister quite often and love to pull the were your parents we have the right card a lot whenever they do something we dont like but until last night i would have never considered the word abusive last night my sister let her phone die while she was out with her friends something they have been very clear about not wanting to happen we have life meaning everyone can see everyone elses phone battery percentages at all times my mom was upset and called my sister after she had charged her phone she raised her voice a little bit and sorta berated her in front of her friends she was in tears the whole drive home and she later said that her friends spent the drive talking to her like she had abusive parents when she got home my dad asked what was wrong and she said she would talk in the morning but my dad kept insisting so my sister snapped and started yelling she went into her room and was bawling my dad was trying to talk to her she was having a panic attack which she told my dad at the time my mom then came in and started yelling at her for her behavior and spent upwards of fifteen minutes standing in front of my sister and demanding she hand over the phone my sister refused she wanted to call our aunt and go over to her house for the night but our aunt was asleep my mom kept asking and she kept refusing this escalated to my mom following her around the house when my sister tried to get away threatening to call the cops if she didnt hand the phone over and eventually splashing a glass of water on my sisters face out of anger she claimed it was to calm her down and never apologized even saying she would gladly do it again she accused my sister of drinking she is and spent a fairly long time yelling at her about how disappointed she was she heard the comment about her friends thinking she was abusive and responded by saying that she should find a more loving family if they were that bad like i said before i have never considered my parents abusive but i am starting to rethink that,Positive

things he did didnt get to write all of it but its the things that i still remember refuses to give me a key for the apartment always yells at me to get out of the shower even if my hair is covered in shampoo and if i dont hell switch off the lights and shut down the water completely wakes me up in the middle of the night to go clean up my cats litter because he gets up to pee during the night and hes the only one that is affected by it destroys my stuff food related i made a protein smoothie drank some and left some for my sister he went to the kitchen and let it flow down the drain to the very last drop also happened once with coffee he poured it down the drain in the sink after i just finished making it because i replied with you too at his awful comment that he made about me takes my stuff away that i paid for so its basically stealing took away my laptop charger my amazon alexa echodot the charger for it my phone charger i had to go to look for it individually around the house in order to find my own stuff again the amazon alexa i still havent gotten back and he refuses to give me it back he even threatened me that hed destroy it calls me names multiple times a day slurs and tells me to go fuck myself talks shit about me with others brings me down emotionally all the time i ignore all of this because im not at that low of a level and position pushes me out of the way every time he gets i almost got my fingers stuck in the silverware drawer because he pushed me into it while i was trying to get a fork out pushes me out of his room forcefully whenever i try to talk to him doesnt let me have the stuff that i bought with my own money in my own room i bought a new printer because the old one he bought it broke it could be fixable but i cant do it and i doubt hell do it for me so i decided to buy a new one since i need it for school and other stuff threatened me not to move the old printer from there and not to dare put the new one there hits me occasionally i threatened to call the cops on him and he got incredibly mad and slapped me on my face and proceeded to call me names and curse at me for dont you dare scare me off even though he scares us off all the time and threatens us to do the stuff that he wants every time hits my family too he once got into a heated argument with my mom proceeded to hit her so hard her entire arms were fully covered in big blue bruises we took pictures of it but sadly the pictures got deleted as we were forced to factory reset the phone as she had forgotten the password to it takes aways my moms stuff as well her own stuff that she bought its her phone most of the times so she was forced to buy another phone that would be kept secret from him in case he would take it away from her he used to take my own phone away as well my mom bought it for me so its not even his over the stupidest things ever he used to take it away as a joke and id have to kiss his ass to get it back say please like times and kiss him on the cheek wtf he forcefully pushed me out of the way when taking something out of the fridge he tried closing it while my arm was still inside the fridge and so crushing my arm then yelled at me to get out of the kitchen while i was still making food for myself because i was hungry after work considers i always owe him something at all times and if i couldnt fulfill his demands right then and there he would take my phone away and proceed to yell at me angrily even if i would be busy doing something else destroys stuff around the house when something doesnt go his way he took some bar and hit the light on the ceiling with it and it proceeded to break and crumble into glass shards everywhere all of this because we wouldnt turn off the light when he wanted to my mom wanted to have the light on too he almost destroyed the clothing drying rack because it was in his way overall very destructive and with serious anger issues always listens to facebook reels or youtube or the tv on basically full volume and gets mad whenever someone tells him to turn it down a little this is especially true in the late evening when i try to sleep or when my mom is trying to get my little sister to fall asleep also disregards any remark about him turning it down calls my mom fat all the time brings her down emotionally calls her names gets incredibly angry when she doesnt pick up the phone after the first time he called he always has to be begged to do something even to come eat my mom has to beg him and kiss him and stuff like that like wtf someone makes you food and you even want to be begged to come eat it always takes very long to do something that we asked but expects us to complete his demands immediately note that most of this has happened ever since i stopped talking to him after i expressed my opinion on everything i thought about him and how unfair he is treating us about months now i live in berlin germany any advice would be pretty helpful im pretty stuck here i dont have nearly enough money to move out i can move out in about a year when i move in with my boyfriend in belgium after i graduate high school but i dont think i can handle this treatment for another year its draining me emotionally and physically and ive always been too scared to call the police because im afraid things may take a turn to even worse my mum cant really do much about this either ive told her multiple times to just get a divorce but she keeps saying its not that easy and shes just scared to raise kids on her own well more like two because im pretty much independent now she hates him just as much but still takes his side sometimes like today when i asked her if i could have the money the state gives me a month to find a room to stay in she said that if she was me she would let her guard down and go apologize thank you for your comments,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i f come from a conservative mexican family i would describe most of them as judgamental hypocritical and nosy to some degree but my mom takes the crown ever since i can remember and the stories i have heard from other family members she has had anger issues and likes to lie manipulate and cause harm if she doesnt get her way shes a drama queen who never apologizes or even recognizes her wrong doings the worst part is that i seem to be the only one who sees that and wont take her shit so therefore im the problem my dad and sibling enable her and wont do shit to defend me or even themselves when she goes on a rampage some examples of what she has done during her little outbursts besides the obvious yelling of obscenities threw and broke a set of china and a lamp ripped apart a cupboard door almost smashed my phone and the incident that led me to seek solace here but before we get to that have some context around her behaviour she has looked through my belongings read my diaries and conversations a couple of times taken away all my devices despite my age and me not having even raised my voice given me the silent treatment threatened to call the police on my friends for harassing me because she didnt want me to hang out with them threatened to cut me off and kick me out threatened to ask the rest of the family to not support me financially anymore i heavily rely on them because my parents wont give me more than a few bucks for public transport called me lazy a whore and all the variations of idiot made backhanded compliments and passiveaggresive remarks to sum it up shes a bitch and a control freak she also has to have my location at all times or else she will freak out once i was out and about without my location on and she called me six times sent ominous texts to worry me and when i picked up my dad told me she was having a heart attack and she wont calm down until she sees my location and if i go out with friends i have to share their full names and phone numbers at the very least i know its a safety measure but i cant stand it anyways to the incident in question ive always wanted to be in a rock band to perform and make music but my mom and dad have never been fond of the idea mostly because they dont like the scene the environment the weird people and the affiliation to drugs musicians have which i can understand i am in a band now and while they dont like it they sorta support me or that was until what happened some days ago the band had the ohsowonderful idea of accepting an sponsorshipcollab with a guy who sells pot and my mom caught wind of it to say that all hell broke loose would be an understatement my parents said that while they trusted i dont smoke anything or even drink they dont trust the bad people i am surrounding myself with and began yelling about how im not safe there that im going to get myself killed that if cops ever came around one of our shows i was going to end up in jail and blemish my record even i didnt do anything that a cartel would send hitmen to kill everyone thanks to that one guy selling pot that im going to get kidnapped that i was stupid naive and careless for trusting my bandmates and the people around us and a myriad of other messed up stuff in all honestly while i understand where theyre coming from i think most of that shit is borderline ridiculous and very extreme my mom told me she would have failed as a mother if she let me hang around places like that meaning the seedy bars and venues in which we host our shows and that she was going to save me before it was too late and demanded i quit the band in that instant i refused the argument and her reactions kept escalating until she took my guitar from my room and put it in her bathroom i laughed at her feeble attempt of keeping it away from me and tried to take it but she quickly got right behind me she tried to rip it away from me and a physical fight ensued she said she would destroy it if i didnt quit and did as she said that i know shes capable of such and threatened to throw it out the window and run it over with the car she kicked the guitar a couple of times and tried to rip away the tuning keys mind you my dad was right in front of us just looking at us with a lost stare didnt do shit besides telling my mom to calm down at this point i know i am alone in this i let go of the guitar and told her to do whatever she wants and locked myself in my room some minutes later i hear her locking the guitar up in the car its been days and im afraid of the damage the heat and my mom may have done to the guitar my mom no longer leaves her keys on the table besides the entrance this is something i need to solve asap as i have an event with the band in some days but i dont know what to do i feel like everyone is acting against me even my own sibling is telling me i should let her win or shell make my life miserable i feel like i was backed into a corner i cant go to the rest of my family for support because they are just as messed up in the head as her and will try to tell me shes right and convince me that i am better off being normal behaving and acting like a lady they want to fix me i think its all bullshit i dont know what to do or say that will make my mom change her mind everything was fine until that stupid collab i know i should have put my foot down and not let that happen but i didnt want to come across as a goodytwoshoes anyways i cant change the past but i dont want to leave the band any advice take into account im a college student living with my parents with a whopping bucks allowance per month and that if i runaway or move away right now i will most likely recieve horrible backlash from my family what the fuck can i do or say or compromise to make her change her mind and see how ridiculous she sounds,Positive
this happened years ago but im only just now realizing how fucked up it is so about years ago my mother who neglected me for years showed up and stared being a part of my life again only to announce that she had cheated on my dad was pregnant but didnt know who the father was at the time i was btw i didnt understand and was just happy to have a sister however when my younger sister was born i discovered something terrifying the first thing my mom pointed out to me when i met my half sister was that we have the same name we dont have the exact same name but in the original language the names are derived from they have the same meaning my mother thought this would be a way for us to bond however i realize now how terrible that is my mom abandoned me when i was and didnt contact me for almost years missing a large majority of my childhood in a way i felt like she did this because she saw my half sister as a replacement or a do over child for me it still hurts now because she devotes all her time into being a good mother for her and gets to watch her grow up meanwhile my mom hasnt been here for me at all since she didnt come for my birthday left early at my graduation and wont bother to see me before i leave for college but will constantly post her other daughter online often and spend every day with her on top of that my half sister is a brat because my mom lets her get away with everything and i have to deal with her exhusband my dad who manipulates and abuses me verbally because he thinks that just because he stayed and my mom didnt that makes him a better parent than her maybe its just jealousy but sometimes i just feel straight rage and i wanna scream so theres my story time lol,Positive
he can be extremely nasty one day and very nice another when hes mad at me he says really hurtful things even accused me of being an animal abuser ive never abused animals and said im the most selfish person hes ever met as a kid he told me things children should never ever hear from anyone he told me people like me get bullied when i felt anxious after encountering a middle school bully hes threatened to beat me up multiple times and he was a martial arts champion he even gets verbally aggressive with my cats over small things however he pays for most of my things and says he wants to repair our relationship i dont have much respect for him but when hes nice i feel guilty about it also my family gives me crap for assuming the worst from him how do you guys handle thing sort of relationship,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i f dont know if my parents are abusive and i was hoping the ppl here could help me find a definitive answer my dad used to scream at me and my brothers when we did something wrong this generally meant that if we were annoying him he would start shouting at us even though we were very young one time that i remember because of what he did afterwards i think i was about making my brothers and i was being sulky and in response to him saying i needed to do something stop fighting with my older brother i think and i said okay in a disrespectful tone and he without warning shouted no it is not okay i think this wouldnt be too bad but when i was i lived alone with him for some months and when he would laugh or raise his voice as in speak slightly louder than before when he was on work calls despite him being downstairs and me being upstairs in my room my heartrate would rise noticeably and roughly once a week i would pause what i was listening to to listen to him to make sure he wasnt angry so i knew i was safe i still get scared sometimes when he clears his voice bc its a similar sound the reason i remember it is not okay is because while he was screaming at me he threw a plastic tub filled with wall plugs boxes of screws etc at me breaking it and making the contents spill out while he didnt hit me when it broke part of the plastic scratched my leg i dont recall any other times when he tried to hurt me but i think he mightve broken a cup in our living room when he was angry my memorys fuzzy and my older brother said that he used to hit us specifically our younger brother but i dont know if thats true i dont remember any of it if i was too young to remember being hit when i can remember as far back as my th birthday my brother who is yrs younger wouldve been incredibly young the reason im not sure if this is abuse is that i think there needs to be a pattern and i only remember him trying to hurt me once since i was he has improved a lot and he hasnt shouted at any of us since and is just a regular shitty father now for my entire life my mum has made me feel like theres something wrong with me and nitpicked my behaviour while also being quite neglectful she has threatened and once has stopped buying food for me and my brothers she doesnt let us eat her food we were never taught how to cook my older brother has eds so might not be able to walk to the nearest supermarket and back i am agoraphobic to the extent that i cant use public transport without being told a week in advance and my little brother was at this point and i wouldnt trust him to not just buy sweets for himself although this lasted for less than a week she stopped doing her job as a parent who quit her job to take care of us bc we were backtalking to her she also makes very odd comments abt my body and has since i started puberty as an year old talking abt the pajamas i wear she thought the shorts were indecent to wear at the dinner table when ur sitting down my older brother regularly wears underwear at the table but she doesnt complain about that and humiliate him in front of the rest of us my figure and my weight loss in a way that if a boy did i would think he was trying to flirt and failing badly she has also called me attractive when i was and i have asked her to stop commenting on my body multiple times bc its fucking weird but eventually i stopped asking since i know it wont stop her i asked one of my friends if she thought it was sexual harassment and she did but take the words of a yr old girl with a grain of salt ive left out some details of their behaviour bc its pm where i am im tired and i dont think they amount to abuse any more than what ive already described so yeah i think a lot of this is grey area stuff but id really appreciate some input from this subreddit,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
f living with m abusive father he has been physically emotionally verbally and psychologically abusive my entire life im at a point where i dont know what to do any more i just had a son months ago and i feel desperate because while i was pregnant i got fired from my job already sought litigation and got some money from it but i am now working part time again need the money to save to cover expenses like food and bills since my partner isnt working because we have no help with childcare partners from out of state and has no family here and im from where were living but i have no family because they consist of abusive people and have hated me since i spoke up about my cousin inflicting sexual trauma on me when i was a child because we are not financially stable were living in the house i co own with my dad and he has always tried to say hed help me and be there for me and do anything he can and i stupidly kept believing it because hes literally the only family i have and i would have no one and so the hope that he would change went over the logic of reconciling he wont and i feel like im losing my mind two weeks ago my dad was shaming me for creating boundaries around being able to touch or pick up my son my dad is constantly out around so many different people from where he works and i only asked that he wash his hands before touching my son and he says this thing of get over it or dont worry about it and when i tell him hes my son and i have a right to ask that people not touch him after touching surfaces that random strangers touch all day and that my dads complaints of having diarrhea or a stomach bug dont make me feel any better about him not washing his hands he tells me i have too many boundaries and i dont need them i get frustrated and say the conversation is annoying and id like for him to just leave me alone he responded by threatening to slap me because im a disrespectful little bitch and hes my father and i dont respect him and he goes and does it he attacks me and hits me and then im trying to push him away and keep him away from me while also trying to think about how to keep my son safe and im screaming for my husband while hes inside making a bottle and cant hear me then my dad hits me in my face and grabs my shirt and rips it as he lifts it up and exposes my breasts and stares at them im humiliated and he still isnt letting me go and i wind up screaming for help and essentially going feral trying to bite his neck because im so afraid and feeling unsafe i called the police and because hes a retired officer himself the cop just said okay well you should move out yeah no fucking shit i should move out if i had a place to go or any fucking money to do it i would be gone i would have been gone but im stuck here and cant fucking leave and my family all knows how he is and just tells me to call the police but they dont help i am at my wits end and i am in a state of fight because i am so tired of being afraid that he is going to attack me again and hurt me or rape me or kill me in front of my son and my husband wouldnt even know until it happens and might find me we have no where to go and no one to help and im supposed to be starting school again so i can get my degree to be able to move my career across state so that i can finally go no contact i feel so fucking alone and hes done shit like this to me my whole life and i truly dont know what to do because now its extending to my family and it feels like its my fault because hes my dad he keeps saying he doesnt wanna fight and he loves me but then he threatens me and my husband and just walks into our home without an invitation and then responds by telling me i need to get over it i know most of you will say get a restraining order in the process of doing so call police done that already several times and filed police reports or move no money and cant uproot my career because it would set us back financially even more im more so just venting about all this because i have no one to talk about it besides my partner and hes exhausted from dealing with my dad too so its not like i can expect him to be there for me when hes feeling shitty too i dont want my son to be subjected to this and seeing his mom feel and look crazy because im responding to my abuse with an intense reaction i literally have no patience left no grey rocking method left in me no accessing my inner cilian murphy because i am so fucking tired of being gaslit and dismissed and shamed and told because im someones daughter i deserve to be small and not have a voice and shouldnt speak up because only bad people have boundaries or defend themselves i feel like im fucking going crazy and im so tired of feeling unsafe and im so angry to the point where im yelling at my father to just leave me alone and go fucking die because hes a useless abusive piece of shit but because i cant keep it together because im so mad and reactive from him hurting me my entire life that i just look like the crazy one i dont know what to do i just wish i had someone i wish i had a friend i wish i had a place to go to and feel safe and i wish i wasnt born into a family that uses me as a fucking scape goat just because im the cycle breaker and i let people know of the generational abuse in our family ive blamed myself for their treatment of me so long because i started to believe that i must be a terrible person if my family treats me this way right i must be a piece of shit for my father to rip my shirt and stare at my breasts and slap me and for my aunt to call me a year old promiscuous slut because her son raped me right if i wasnt a piece of shit then why would they treat me this way and now ive gone to being angry and thinking you know what i dont deserve this so im just gonna traumatize him right back but honestly aside from fucking yelling and crying all the time i feel like hes gonna wind up killing me or vice versa i dont know what to fucking do the loneliness makes me want to kill myself because it feels like ill never escape,Positive
im f and have been out of my parents house for about years now since going to college and moving away as soon as i graduated basically my dad was very verbally abusive growing up screamed and berated me constantly and my mom only enabled his behavior and never stood up for me would use the classic im telling your father threat my dad rarely talks to me now so i dont have much of an issue with him i think he understands i dont want to be close with him my parents and i never once talked about my awful experiences growing up and i have a very estranged relationship with them i live about hrs away in another state now with my partner the issue im facing now is particularly with my mother she texts me every single day and freaks out worrying when i dont respond shell call me on the phone and go on about mundane things its just becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with this act of talking all friendly with her knowing i cant forgive how she treated me growing up she never once apologized i dont even know how or where to begin to address it and i feel terrible sometimes for feeling this way because shes so friendly on the phone sometimes just chatting away about whatever it just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth because i know how she truly was to me growing up these conflicting feelings are really whats affecting me the most i guess what i want to ask is how can i set further boundaries with her im not comfortable texting her every day especially knowing she will panic when i dont respond i cant even understand why she acts like that because we have not been close since i was a young child could it possibly be that shes afraid or expecting me to fully shut her out i really dont know and if i even attempt to set any boundaries she will probably cause a huge scene and guilt trip me she would definitely drive up to my apartment too hours from her i just dont even know what to do can anyone relate to this situation,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
so in the many arguments my parents have had my mother would bring up the fact that my dads actions his abuse would lead to me sobbing about wanting to end my life this is true but i have never been able to fully go through with it always too scared today my dad was picking out clothes for me as i have a college visit at a very prestigious university tomorrow morning i didnt want him to go into my room because its a depressive mess right now and i know hed only make snide remarks to make me feel bad about myself but he didnt listen to me and went upstairs anyway for some reason this just made me crack and i fell to my knees and started silently sobbing my mom was upset that i was stressing her out my brother was instigating to make me feel worse and my dad was just being himself i tried to go downstairs to breathe and be alone so i could recollect myself but my dad ordered i go to my room and help him when i did he just started complaining that i have no nice clothes he doesnt buy me clothes and i just started shaking because his wave of insults and stupidity was only just starting he later started rambling asking me what would i do if i lost my memory and he was the only person i remembered i dont know what i was thinking but i lost it and said id kill myself i gave him details telling him the exact way i used to think of doing it and he told me to stop talking he got quiet and ended up leaving me alone i dont know if he cares i dont think he ever will care but what i do know now is that i hate this crazy family college couldnt come any sooner at this point and im sick of waiting,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
this is weird ive never posted on reddit but i dont know where else i could even begin to ask these questions how do you even begin to get a foot in the door in your life bit of backstory back when i was a child my father lived with me till the age of im now my father was abusive sexually physically mentally and emotionally until he had to move out from a restraining order along with my brother at the time because they were found out for sexually abusing me and siblings along with cp they moved in so its been awhile i should mention my mother was also heavily abused so this next part makes any sense after my father and brother moved out it was just me my mother and little sister and immediately my mother fell into depression as you would but ever since things have honestly amped up and shes became the abuser my mother isnt half as bad no sexual abuse very limited physical abuse like she may kick me once or twice but the emotional abuse is insane she gaslights me everyday over stupid things then says im gaslighting her some examples where did you get the toilet paper from mum the one on the handle me there isnt one on the handle mum well there was me youre lying you got it from the basket no i didnt youre gaslighting me mum or shell scream at me that i dont care about her and how im a manipulative psychopath because she asked for a can of coke so i gave her one instead of pouring it into a cup thinking she wanted the can of coke as is and when i tried to communicate and ask her to specify next time so i dont mess up again she screams at me and accuses me of being just like my father she takes it so far to say outlandish things like youre intelligence is too low to be able to do insert normal thing you had a part in your childhood rape with your father youre hiding something from me about your father youre secretly running me down to all your friends youre manipulating me all the time just to get whatever you want youre planning on running away everyone at your university hates you all your friends mothers hate you everyone is going to leave you once they see how abusive you are and the list goes on im not saying the worst of it because if she ever finds this shell deny it anyways it even came to the point where i told my mother about the k fee on my uni considering im and have no job due to me not being allowed to have one even tho ive begged she said shed pay it before i even applied then when i applied she said she refused to pay it she made me forge her signature i have proof of her texting me to do it she made that loophole so she didnt have to pay because she didnt sign she held it over my head and refused to pay until last minute and proceeded to scream at me that she never said she wouldnt pay it and im gaslighting her even though both my psychologist and boyfriend witnessed her saying she refused multiple times i called her at uni stressing because she refused to pay and made me sound like a gaslighter in front of everyone on the phone and even now she says that i manipulated her into paying the k and i never even told her she had to pay it before i applied i have audio of this shes attempted to kick me out multiple times and then gets mad at me when i leave and guilt trips me saying how sad ive made my sister the most recent time i went to my friends now boyfriends house for awhile and it was good but i eventually always have to come back and face this abusive shit again im also very much blind need glasses to see of things and my mother promised to get them fixed for me theyve broken in all ways they can and shes too depressed to help me ive recorded many many audios of her screaming and my friends have pointed out she sounds slurred in her speech and isnt making much sense and i agree i dont have my own bank account im attempting to open one i cannot fix my glasses and i am in extreme need of glasses to do much of anything i have untreated health issues and practically no form of escape does anyone have any tips of what i may be able to do ive been thinking about just sticking my head into uni and im trying but shes taken away my uni work at points and ive been talking to my psychologist but i havent told her all of it because im scared of what may happen ive had friends recommend doctors and social workers so i am looking into that but does anyone know any tricks on how to make my mother not blow up about random things its honestly so crushing every time i have to go home from school or friends places its been years now of it and im turning next year i know once im shes kicking me out for good so im preparing to go overseas for uni im an artist should have mentioned that art uni ive been thinking about commissions and getting paid for those or talking to teachers at uni and getting extensions on work so i have more time to get my things together the shitty part of this is shes my only parent left and ive watched her go from abused to abuser and its horrifying thinking about my future with her or lack there of because i cannot exist near her without her blowing up i have many pets i adore and refuse to leave behind so i know im well trapped for many years to come and my friends have warned me there is no way of stopping the abuse only escaping i just really need a foot in the door to fix things cleaning the whole house is never enough being kind isnt enough being successful in school isnt enough nothing is enough for her she refused to care even when i was struggling with self harm to the point of my muscle being visible nothing works she beats down my self esteem so much so i cant leave your friends hate you theyll kick you out so i feel extremely uncomfortable reaching out for help she lies to my psychologist so i feel odd trying to express myself there shes drowning me in all this shit and i need help,Positive
the title is pretty self explanatory my mom and i had the typical fight which led to her yelling about how awful and painful her life is all because of me being an over demanding bitch cue a long fight later she couldnt name one thing i demanded i didnt demand any food or drink i requested something once in june and she happily agreed because she liked the food product i specifically was ready to quit therapy despite trying to work on myself because i cant drive yet and she was yelling at me for wasting time on therapy she doesnt pay for it i just cant understand why have a kid if youre going to throw a tantrum every time said kid needs something i get its annoying but again thats the fucking point this is ignoring the fact that throughout my childhood she didnt let me even act like a child i wasnt allowed to be loud or messy or even have hobbies she didnt approve of and to this day she still judges and insults my hobbies sorry for the post i just needed to rant badly,Positive
im not really sure what to do anymore i still live at home with my narcissisticalcoholic mom and its heavily weighing on me mentally to the point that i feel stretched extremely thin and about every week she gets super drunk and says the most nastiest thing imaginable getting in my face and occasionally getting physical pushinggrabbing etc when i was younger my dad was extremely verbally abusive not to mention extremely narcissistic this has caused a lot of issues for me and im still trying to work through it thats why when this happens with my mom it triggers me even further i cant afford to live anywhere else at the moment and with each argument she raises my rent price i word two jobs and i am in my last semester of college i work extremely hard and push myself because i know i deserve the life i want to live my mom knows this and still threatens making me homeless if i dont do chores to her pristine liking no one knows what im going through besides my boyfriend and he helps as much as he can always listening and opening to his doors in the nights that it gets so bad that i have to leave i guess all im really looking for is some type of community so i know im not alone i dont know all i know is that i am really hurting ive called the cops on her before didnt really help much and im just at a loss ive tried complying and not talking back when she gets like this and to no avail ive tried to just not engage and then she gets upset because she feels like we dont have a relationship anymore,Neutral
before i go and type away my thoughts i would like to give a trigger warning as this pertains to my experience with sexual assault rape abusive relationships and victim blaming id like to preface that im not much for lying im bad at it and i think it rarely serves a purpose if this isnt a mindset that makes sense thats fair im autistic also as of writing im f i apologize that its so long i wanted to give full context and honestly just talk about all of it today i decided to go to mcdonalds with my mother she had been bothering me about how late i stay working at the desk and wanted to go out with me hungry i obliged while inside we noticed a rather uncomfortable situation a mother with her two daughters and a man that we assumed to be her partner or possibly her childrens father this man was all over her and seemed generally unhelpful despite the mother dealing with her children his posture was one i later called the broke baby daddy stance if you know you know once we had finished eating and left the restaurant my mother commented on how she didnt like when men relied on women to pay she specified that although men dont need to pay for anything she finds this weird i would like to clarify that my mothers opinions are not automatically my own i went on to recall how my exboyfriend who i dated when i was months did this to the point that the day he dumped me he had made me drive us to mcdonalds pay for our food and drive back to his parents house before he broke up with me he was broke not really and unemployed i told her how when we first started dating he would pay for everything leading me to believe he was more welloff and more generous than he actually was its hard to remember the exact unfolding of the conversation but she asked if i really was staying the night in a guest room when i stayed at his parents house and i admitted that i had lied about that for context my mom is a conservative catholic woman who believes sex is strictly for marriage she then interrogated me asking what his parents thought they didnt care and what kind of example i was setting for his younger sister she naturally assumed we mustve been having loud sex something i do find concerning as i feel she frequently sexualizes me in unnecessary ways this led to the topic of how in that relationship i felt pressure to have sex early on i told him i wanted to wait i had felt used before and wanted it to feel right this didnt matter and he was persistent my mom asked why i didnt just leave after all i had a car she said its not like he would have forced himself on you that is not something i know after all he didnt seem particularly against coorsion something that happened frequently while we were dating she told me how she taught me to say no and to not be pressured i disagree if that were true maybe we wouldnt be here i mentioned how i feel as though i never learned how to set boundaries properly and that i never felt comfortable saying no we then discussed how she adamantly didnt like the man i dated before him he was when i dated him i was im not a fan of him either he was equally manipulative and didnt do well with boundaries my mom mentioned her fondness for the man i had just broken up with he was and a very sweet person on the surface but just like the others he was manipulative although perhaps not intentionally and i was tired of feeling like i wasnt being listened to when we pulled into our driveway i mentioned how i may choose to only date women after this failed relationship im pansexual i mention how i am scared of sex and intimacy and being with women these issues can be more easily navigated she asks if ive ever been forced and i dont answer she asks this because in her mind that could be the only reason i fear intimacy now despite what ive just told her when i choose not to answer she begins guessing who it was until i tell her it was the yearold man i dated at she asks how and why i didnt tell her and i say it was at a party i wasnt supposed to be at she continues interrogating was i high yes who was there him and his friends why didnt i yell scream get someone to intervene i dont know i think i was too scared to tell her i didnt really know what was happening i was high and confused and maybe to me it felt like the closest thing to love in a while so when he threatened to do it anyway if i said no i didnt fight it i didnt fight his hand on my mouth as i made noise from the pain i was a good victim she mentioned that maybe i should talk to my dad about this he might have some perspective i wasnt looking for advice or perspective though i was simply answering the questions she threw at me at this point she gave a couple this is why i didnt want you staying over and other i told you so like remarks she eventually gives me a somewhat unwelcome hug and i carry on with my work in the presence of my cat fast forward to later this evening i am called down to eat and as to not upset her i abandon the movie i had been watching as i finish eating my mom begins in front of my dad mentioning how now on im not allowed to have any sleepovers with anyone i would like to remind you that i am a full adult who has been living with the trauma from my mistakes for up to years now because as my parents are currently unaware of my brothers best friend assaulted me when i was this wasnt my first experience with assault or harassment but it was the first that was deeply traumatizing my mother said that if i disagreed with this i could move out i currently live rentfree with my parents while i go to university and although i do appreciate this it doesnt give my parents the right to control my life outside of the home in my opinion also these exact rules are what got me in trouble in the first place the night i was raped when i was i wanted to call someone the night had started with a lighter assault him touching my breasts inappropriately while i was very crossed weed alcohol i wanted to leave but i was more scared of my parents reaction to me being where i wasnt supposed to be than i was of what was happening i stayed adamant that being assaulted wasnt my fault but although she agreed she said it was my fault for getting in that situation and being high ill admit that it was stupid i was naive and honestly just excited to be seen and wanted the way i felt like i wasnt but i also mentioned that i didnt learn comprehensively about consent my mom said i was trying to blame her and my dad and the truth is part of me does if i felt safe talking to them about things maybe i would have reported maybe it wouldnt have taken me so long to realise what happened was wrong she said that she hates seeing me hurt and thats why shes being like this but she didnt see me hurt i made myself heal and get better on my own she wasnt there for any of that and no she didnt teach me to set boundaries since she has been violating mine constantly the fact that she even brought up the issue to him without even asking me proves it i guess i just want someone on my side i have therapy tomorrow but im not sure i can wait that long to get this off my chest please someone just tell me im not crazy,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

this is long sorry using my throwaway for obvious reasons i lived with my mom growing up were nc now and have been for years i knew she was abusive and thought i remembered a few particularly horrible things shed done but wasnt sure if they were real memories because they seemed too extreme ive been nc with her whole side of the family for the last years but recently got back in touch with one of her brothers i remember liking him when i met him as a kid but i only met him about six times in total weve ended up in similar jobs and we connected on linkedin got talking and decided to have a zoom call hes been going to therapy recently and has been processing a lot about his childhood i asked what had happened to him and he described his mom doing to him the exact same horrible things id thought i remembered mine doing to me so either both of us have independently come up with fd up false memories or it all actually happened and my mom got it from hers then he told me his mom had poisoned him several times she was a pharmacist so is mine so knew what she was doing she apparently mostly just made him really sick but one time nearly killed him and his stepdad saved his life by rushing him to the er where they confirmed hed been poisoned this was a lot to take in so i was debriefing with my best friend from childhood over a gt a few days later and she went moll i hate to say this but remember all those weird suddenonset illnesses you had when we were kids that stopped when you left home and i was like oh shit we looked up the symptoms of poisoning with the specific things we knew my grandma had used on my uncle and the symptoms all match the mysterious illnesses i had as a kidteenager anyway tldr my mom picked up a bunch of severely abusive behaviours from her mom and did them on me ive just realized she probably also poisoned me throughout my childhood dunno what the point of this post is really just in a bit of a,Neutral

background f and my f sister have had to deal with a severely abusive mother and an abusiveneglectful father mother has tried to villainize us in front of our dad and vice versa which is why he never took our side when she verbally physically and sexually assaulted us current situation we thought it would get better after we graduated because it would prove to our parents that we were capable things were initially okay but quickly deteriorated in july and we have been trapped in our rooms since our mother makes up scenarios to villainise us to our dad and our relatives we try to avoid her to minimize conflict which means we get to eat only at odd times whenever she locks herself in her room she hasnt been cooking any proteinaceous food so we have been losing weight and have constant brain fog which is worsening every day she cooks food we specifically do not like is too bland or too spicy which basically means we dont ever have a full meal she has called us cancers she keeps urging our father to have us kicked out our father doesnt take her side and thinks we are provoking her to behave in this manner we just want out but we dont have uae currency to get a way out and dont have that many rupees to securely start our life in india our health is deteriorating i cannot focus on anything i live in constant fear of her pulling some new trick or barging into our rooms i am hyper aware of every sound she makes because if she goes into her room that means i cant go drink water or eat something i cant live like this for too long we need to know what our options are considering our age and situation we only have money in rupees because we have only earned in india our father only tries to keep the family together to keep up his image in society no one interacts with us if we leave authorities will have to be involved or we need to run away without most of our belongings our aim is not to present a sob story to get money out of people we need to know our options we need to have a plan what are some things that we shouldshould not do,Neutral
this is going to sound stupid but im not sure if my parents are abusive or just conservative with some mental health issues sometimes they call me a liar and irresponsible and talk about my body negatively theyve slut shamed me in the past and even called me an attention seeker after i fainted at the dining table they belittle me call my partner prettier then me and say i express myself as poor to get peoples pity once theyve even yelled at me in front of a hundred or two students after the school called them to pick me up because i was sick with strep and mono but this isnt all the time sometimes theyre nice and gift me things and do things for me theres good moments and because of that im not sure if theyre abusive id really like to know if this would be considered abuse,Neutral

i have a trans autistic sibling whos in th grade and i actually feel so damn bad for him hes and our mom is he ordered a binder at some point since hes more developed than other kids his age and wanted to hide his breasts for obvious reasons when he got the package my mom pressured him to open it and then she interrogated him and then said that she cant let him wear it and that he needs to accept being a girl and refused to let him have the binder that he paid for with his own money she yelled at him and hit him over it before this when he cut his hair and felt so happy he felt like he looekd good just for our parents to scream and him and just ruin that small bout of joy he had now ever since the binder incident when he was forced to come out to her shes been making comments on his breasts or butt sometimes she just outright tells him he looks fat and he feels horrible this actualyl fucked him up so goddamn bad he genuinely hates himself he has really bad memory and forgets things that our mom tells him to do just for him to be screamed at and feeling like he cant do anything right like he doesnt even deserve to be in this house he feels like he isnt deserving of food or water because he forgets to pick up something as insignificant as a bottle cap or a paper towel and just stopped eating he feels like he doesnt deserve to be clean and outright stopped showering he thought of overdosing on his risperidone because he believed he wasnt even deserving of life not to mention at some point our mom got so mad at him that she called his damn middle school and made sure he wouldnt pass as an all bstudent she even changed his plan to sit close to teachers even though he told her feels extremely uncomfortable around adults because of the way she touches him and told him that maybe hell learn his lesson she even calls him the r slur because he doesnt talk to others and she just overall does things that make him feel like a piece of shit i want to help him so bad but i dont know how,Positive
this is really strange i started crying about it unexpectedly and cant tell if im being overly dramatic which i might beive always had a flair for the dramatic i was scrolling through my moms facebook account and came across some very old pictures from around or of me and my parents i looked so happy especially with my father i dont remember having any good memories of him growing up theyve all been overshadowed by yelling fighting and beatings yet in those pictures we looked so happy i dont understand why and i dont recall what our relationship was like back then we just appeared so content together when i got home today my dad was speaking harshly about me saying how disappointing ive become i feel like a disappointment and he has every right to be angry i just wish i could have my dad back i wish so deeply that we were different people with different lives and then maybe that way i would finally be able to love him and he would love me as well just now my mom told me to go to bed because my dad seems very angry with me and it feels like everyone downstairs is having so much fun without me theyre literally watching wolverine knowing i love marvel more than anyone else no one even asked for me besides my baby brother and theyre about to order dinner while i havent eaten anything but a turkey and cheese sandwich my grandma gave me it just seems like things would be so much better if i was gone,Positive
so im f i have had to cut out all family i have my mom dad step mom brothers and sisters i am literally the most dogged on one my dad and step mom take my half sister and brothers side of the time for instance my sister got pregnant at by an almost year old after accusing my dad of assault mind you i was actually assaulted by my father and never got the chance to stand up while my sister dropped her charges against him and said she made it up my step mom use to put me in cold showers to punish my rebellious behavior but its like a lets stay by them because they are their kids my mom has been a constant abuser i remember so many things from my childhood with her such as smacking us in the shower so she didnt leave marks standing us on the wall while the family ate because we spilled glitter etc she continues to do it in my adulthood by calling me hateful and a bunch of fuck yous when she doesnt like something i do and even downs me as a mother her son my other half brother that she praises is also an abuser of mine but according to her i made it up to play games but i have vivid memories at my point is im losing all hope as a person and a mother i feel like im constantly the problem unloveable and dont understand why out of all my siblings and with my parents why im looked down on i raised my siblings was essentially a maid for both parents and had my own kids at and have done nothing not even asked my parents for a penny since having my children sorry for the ramble and there is so much more but in this can you answer am i the problem if not why did they choose me to abuse,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i just watched the movie big fish for the first time because my girlfriend loves it we just ended the night with an agreement that we needed to stop discussing the movie because i was getting too upset its okay my gf is great we just couldnt see eye to eye on the movie and i took a hard hit to the feels spoilers the movie culminates in an adult child basically in my opinion playing into his fathers selfegrandizing fairy tales as his father dies my girlfriend saw this as him healing and recognizing his father always loved him even if he was bad at showing it all i saw was a child yet again accommodating their narcissistic parent his father never apologized for the fact that he was rarely around he made every event and situation about him boosting himself with his tall tales i couldnt see this as a narrative of reconciliation rather one of a child adapting for an absent parent again and again my mother died in may i hadnt spoken to her in years because she was a narcissistic abuser and wasnt safe to keep in my life she entered end of life and it took nearly a week for her to pass after ish days of declining i chose to go see her because i felt that she might need closure to move on so i sat with her played a favorite song of hers i told her i loved her i told her the good things i was doing with my life so she could know that shed at least raised kids who put good out in the world these were all true they didnt mean i had forgiven her but i had enough love in me to try and give her that peace so she could move on she died about a day later im proud of myself for doing that because i think it helped her and it felt like the right thing to do but i didnt owe her that and i deserved so much better i watched this movie and i didnt see the parts where this grown child grieved that their parent had largely abandoned them i didnt see him get an apology i didnt see him rage about the worthlessness it instills in a kid to know their parent considers them an afterthought at best i just saw the forgiveness of this asshole who never once acknowledged that hed always been focused on himself his story his grandeur and wouldnt you know hed been something of a hero for the downtrodden cool my mom worked for years with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and was quite lovely to her clients she was still an awful mother so watching this movie all i could think was what about being a hero for his fuckin kid what about expending that effort and energy at home its less exciting to be a hero to your kid admiration earned is tastier than admiration owed i feel bad because my gf loves this movie and i feel like i shit all over it i know she understands my perspective but i also feel badly that i couldnt just enjoy a damn movie its frustrating and i feel simultaneously silly and sad and hurt its been a rough night thanks to anyone who gives this a read just needed to vent,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hello i am and i really need advicesince i was a child my mom would abuse me mentally and physically she would constantly call me a cow and keep making me feel bad about my ageat the ages from she would always mention my weightand compare me to my other cousins and how they are skinnyshe would always be so abusive towards me and until this day i keep having flashback of myself getting hit for only wanting my mother to help me out on my school projecti still remember every single time she hit me what pisses me out the most is that my siblings never got treated the same way as i did she still hits me and i am the one that gets abused physically and mentally between my siblings but now she would hit for being depressednot wanting to tell her whats going on with me and for not cleaning the house properly while being depressed and now she just hit me cause i have been sick and couldnt get up and clean i really dont know what to do i am so sick of getting slapped,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
so i f have been abused by my mum pretty much as long as i can remember mostly neglect and emotional abuse but i have been hit by her before luckily not for a few years and shes a massive hoarder that refuses any help and shes been offered a lot i cant afford currently to move out and dont have family i could move in with i am working on it but i never got taught any skills required in adulthood or in general tbh by her and everything ive learnt outside off school i taught myself so its probably taking me longer to be able to move out plus i want to know for sure once i move out i dont have to go back problem is of course is that it is getting increasingly hard to cope with especially as ive gotten older and ive realised more how badly ive been treated and how stuff that id consider an unobtainable luxury currently having a fridge and an oven not having to shower at the gym having a cleanish comfortable space is just normal for the majority of people and not something theyd even think about as ive gotten older ive become quite conflicted on one side i recognise that my mum was abused by my dad quite badly and that shes got mental and physical health conditions thatd make it harder for her to do certain things but on the other side i know how much help shed been offered but had refused in the past and i know how easy it is to do some of the stuff she just never does and the fact that she acts like shes done everything for me but like i have barely any skills the few skills i have i taught myself and when she talks about how she shouldve aborted me or put me up for adoption all i can think is yeah you shouldve youre the last person who should be a parent how do i keep calm while i plan my slow escape both for my own sanity and to prevent the emotional abuse from getting worse because the second i get mildly annoyed by anything i get insulted and belittled so badly,Positive
im f and i have been suffering from financial verbal and emotional abuse for the past months and i dont think i can take it anymore my life got turned upsidedown overnight and i was not prepared financially emotionally or in anyway i spent the next months clawing out of this dark hole and the first step of gaining my freedom was to get a hold of my finances once more after job searching for months i finally landed a job heres where my dilemma comes in my parents know that the only hold they have over me is finances therefore while they did allow me to find a job to support myself they limited my job search to niagara falls which is where they live they did not want me to find a job in toronto which is where i was prior to coming home finishing up my first year of medical school because they know that finding a job far away meant that they wouldnt be able to control me anymore i have to preface that i do not have any siblings or extended family and i have exhausted my friends for the past months with my issues they cannot support me financially because they are also all broke medical students with their own issues when i finally landed a job i realized it was in toronto and i knew that they would not let me attend my first day they made it very clear that if i go against their wishes that i am no longer welcome in the home and that i am on thin ice with them i really dont want to end up homeless and while finding a job in the city that i want is promising i do not have the immediate finances to allow me to move there now im too scared to initiate my no contact my problem is that this job starts in days and i am scared to go its in toronto which is almost hours away and my family is crazy i thought about telling them that i landed a job in niagara so that they allow me to leave the house but knowing them they might choose to show up to my pretend job in niagara whereever i tell them it is and demand to see me immediately the danger here is that the only way for me to attend my job in days is if i lie and say that i am going to work a job in nf because there is no way i can reason with them but if they catch me in this lie then i am officially homeless i want to leave dont get me wrong but i want to arrange my ducks in a row so to speak before i leave i need to ensure my financial and housing situation and i really need this to work out i thought of contacting another job that i got in niagara a while back but stepped down from for the mississauga and ask them to vouch for me in case my parents decide to show up but i think thats crazy i didnt do it i just thought about it they probably would not want to be involved in my situation anyway so my question is how do i attend my first day on the job on monday without them knowing where i work and how do i convince them that i am working in niagara so they leave me alone is there a service i can call to help me properly arrange my escape plan is there a smarter way of going about this that doesnt involve risking homelessness there is not enough reasoning in the world that i can use to try to get to them they are dead set on only working in nf or get out any advice is appreciated please be kind to me im very emotionally fragile,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i have spent years questioning why me why are they screaming at me and abusing me even more than they did with my brothers god bless them it is just that the difference is huge and weird what did i do wrong i am the polite one who listen and smile and dont insulte them nor scream so why i had several ideas about the reason those last years but i think thats it i am their punching bag my mom screaming at me yesterday morning and not talking for the days and now when my brother did it she is coming to me,Neutral
i f am finally realizing that my mom may be abusive but im not sure and i could just be dramatic for one im black and ik black parents discipline their kids differently but if im a parent in the future im sure id take the more gentle parenting approach she would say i brought you into this world and i can take you out when i was young like she would hit me pretty often when i was around that age as well yelling that im too used to to the point i dont even remember i would wear diapers until i was because of bed wetting unsure why and i was like or and forgot to throw it away once i think and left it on the bathroom floor maybe i was in a rush and she shoved me on the floor and made me put my face in it like a dog gave me a black eye once in the morning before school cause of something to do with my laundry forgot what it was would destroy my ipad for being on it all the time which is understandable i guess but my stepfather would always be at work plus i didnt like him and my mom would always be sleeping too tired to spend time or working and i didnt really have friends so i spent my time on my ipad which wasnt all wasted i loved looking at animation and art which is what i like to do my stepfather iswas also a horrible person and i spent like years begging her to leave him even though she always agreed cause she didnt like him either but we stayed for fucking years caused me alot of unnecessary trauma and stress cause they would always physically fight and i was young and didnt want anyone to get hurt so id try to put myself inbetween them says im selfish but im just neurodivergent and clinically depressed like for example sometimes shell tell me to turn the tv on for my baby sister and i do but walk away and forget to turn up the volume to go back to what i was doing this is because i have adhd and kind of have trouble following directions or doing them correctly if she said turn on the tv and turn up the volume id do it cause thats what she ordered but since im kind of on airplane mode i just take it literally and do exactly that hard to explain but i dont do it on purpose and shell yell at me and call me selfish for not helping her clean the house when its literally a executive dysfunction nightmare and i can barely find the energy or physical strength i feel weak most days to clean my room or bathroom and i know to her it looks like im sitting on the couch all day in my phone but im not and my mind is constantly thinking about how to get better and other things like that but its rlly annoying because if she did research on adhd and my condition shed understand but she never does and judges me like im completely mentally fine when my psychologist had to warn her that i had plans of suicide at one point feel like i dont really want to talk to her or anything to do with her when i had thoughts of suicide i put off telling her for months and she had to hear it from my school counselor just cause subconsciously i have a fear of telling her anything i just hate telling her stuff called me obese for the first time under pounds at the time im a while after i told her about my weight insecurities and thats why i dont like telling her things one morning she saw i had took a poop in the toilet and it wouldnt flush so she got mad and plunged it but spilt poop water everywhere she started beating me and made me fall into the water and then cause i think i forgot to wipe my hands after cleaning something when i cleaned my bathroom that day she hit me again think i was maybe or when my grades were slipping and i had to get them up she made me sit in my room and do my work all day understandable cause i had alot of missing work and my adhd adhdd though we didnt know it at the time and i couldnt focus so i wanted to take a break so i went onto youtube for second i think i was in th grade but she came in and saw it and started beating me she was months pregnant at the time and started saying if she went into labor cause of me its my fault says i have nothing to be depressed about and that im a spoiled brat cause we live better than most people and i act like a victim she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and says my disabilities are no excuse and that im soft for being depressed all the time cause she went through it too her whole life she doesnt have a adhd diagnosis but shes like literally twice my age expresses regret for having me and my two year old sister when she gets mad sometimes calls me the b word and a narcissist and says f you calls me a slob and a bum and also dumb and slow cause my neurodivergent brain has trouble registering sometimes says i always whine about my disabilities when i rarely ever bring them up once again i hate telling her things and jokingly said she would take away my adhd meds which was kind of weird says my disabilities dont define me when im struggling which makes me so mad because she doesnt understand at all also doesnt really take my mental health all that seriously clearly but going back to the weight im trying to lose it but she keeps buying snacks despite knowing about my binging and just says excercise and burn calories but thats not how i work with my urges and then later gets angry at me for eating alot of the food and shames me for my habits saying im a user and im like a bottomless pit shell also be empathetic ab my disabilities one moment and then shame me for them the next when she gets angry oh and also acts like i cant have mood swings not diagnosed but i was recommended for bipolar when i got diagnosed for adhd were waiting for the appointment whenever i have them which is most likely cause of the depression and im a teenager if were going off of diagnosis shell get really mad as well despite her literally always having an attitude i remember when i was obviously dissociating at the dinner table and she was just badgering me with the usual shaming and telling me that i was a narcissist cause i had a blank look on my face when i was really just not all there at the moment and not in the mood just insensitive to me in general like shell sing to the top of my lungs in the house but i feel like i cant tell her to stop despite it hurting my ears and getting overstimulated or shell say i can touch you if i want when i dont want to be touched or im feeling overstimulated or angry and then jokingly berating me for it and saying i dont love her anymore and i used to be so sweet shes rlly odd with her parenting and blames me for not knowing how to do things despite not teaching me them for example she blames me for not knowing how to do my hair when she did it for me growing up and says why dont you look on youtube and learn how to do your hair but i dont have any interest in it i dont know why she expects me to one day just be interested in learning how to do my hair which i admit is maybe a little spoiled but i dont know what else to say or how she blames me for not getting into the kitchen and learning how to cook but once again its something she did for me growing up so im not gonna randomly one day be interested in it unless she forces me into the kitchen like an actual parent i told her this because i may not be motivated all the time and she just got mad and said so you want me to be violent is that it ok she even jokingly said tell her to let me do her hair mom to my grandma and my grandma just side eyed her lol she also makes fun of me alot which is maybe me being sensitive but it hurts cause shell jokingly compare me to my baby sister and say shes more interested in cleaning and helping her than me and stuff like that tells me she doesnt know how i think anyone can love me if i dont love myself and im stupid for wanting a relationship not something i crave but just a human want i mention sometimes and on the topic of me being suicidal she said to just go ahead and keel over die then im kind of counting down the days i can get out of her house and even look forward to going to college far far away but i feel a little dramatic or spoiled because i know its probably not that bad despite all of this like this only happens sometimes atleast now she mostly just screams and yells at me but she doesnt rlly hit me anymore and i know this list is just the bad but i mean shes a good mom for a good amount of the time to me and my sister most of the times and she says im her best friend and we do happen to be really close with the fun stuff but i do wish i could run away sometimes i dont know everyone else that isnt in my house says im a really sweet girl and i try to help everyone but sometimes i wonder if im a bad person maybe i am and i want to try to fix it it does make me happy to help people for example i used to help my ex boyfriend with his panic attacks and comfort him and how i stayed up late to help my friend who was going through spiritual psychosis and she said i saved her life or even how my friend thought his friend committed suicide at the time and i spent most of the afternoon helping him feel better and he said it worked but i guess i should do more and maybe even if i am selfish the reason i do it is to feel better about myself i guess i dont know im really tired,Positive
just thinking here after my dad tried to guilt trip me a couple of nights ago he mentally emotionally and sometimes physically hurts me but pretends hes just playing around it makes me sick to my stomach to think ill have to come back from college and live with him once i graduate i dont have enough money to live on my own yet im wondering if i could get away from him by checking myself into a mental hospital i never hear good things about it but if its to get away from him i want to keep my options open,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
trigger warning mentions of abusephysical violence maybe this will help someone a letter to my inner child i think for me the saddest truth that set me free was that deep down there was always going to be a part of my father that wouldntcouldnt like me because he didnt like himself and that that hashad nothing to do with me i think there was a part of me that loved my dad when i was a kid but there was a part of me from a young age that always felt mildly uncomfortable around him like i always knew that there was something wrong there were a lot of demons he faced and this has been shown in multiple physical cases that occurred throughout his life he beat the shit out of his first wife because he caught her cheating also i do believe that there is a high chance he was sexually abused from my deepest inner knowledge my father didnt molest me but there was always something off about my dad i also believe that my father was made to believe that he was worthless and or stupid at a very young agethroughout his life i also believe that my father did indeed do a lot of stupid and somewhat morally indecent and nasty shit my father has and always will have a nasty violent streak to him that had nothing to do with me my father is and was a physically abusive man with a christian spirit the true definition of drjeykll and mr hyde there is a sick or hopeful side of me that is wants to be grateful that he tried while i also know that that was unacceptable and not good enough i was always good enough i was deserving of a love that i did not get im grateful to have found a way to give it to myself i never deserved who he was and any of the things he did and said his actions were the reflections of his own extremely diminished sense of selfworth my father has a christian smile and demeanor that is responsible for deeply hiding the bruises that hes left on the hearts as well as the bodies of several different women myself included my father has issues with women and that will never have anything to do with me i also believe that he went through other horrific violent hardships that his neurodivergent youngminded soul had no chance of fighting against therapy wasnt a thing for black people in the ss and that also was a huge era of crackcoke usage and being from the projects im sure my father was lucky to get food on most days i have to hug my inner child and tell her that these are not excuses but these are facts and that she cant argue with them i also tell her the truth that he will never fully be able to love her and that this is not never was and never will be her fault she deserved worlds better but her parents were two somewhat broken abused and deeply traumatized people joined together in a codependent relationship with christ who attracted each other and due to religious judgment probably felt that they couldnt get a divorce even though my dad physically abused his first wife and then my mother and would later on go ahead to physically abuse me their religion was incredibly strict about divorcesmy grandfather was a deacon again a fact not an excuse also when my father physically jumped on me my mother protected him and my grandmother protected him because in their religion black men but more so fathers active fathers at that are seen as holding almost the same importance as god my grandmother would often piss me off by saying you dont talk to your father because you hate him or its not like he molested you did he molest you which translated to me as be grateful that your father didnt molest you she would also tell me you have to excuse him deanna he didnt have a good father he didnt have a good upbringing and that sentence alone assisted in me suppressing years of anger and deep pain that i am grateful to have now dealt with through therapy and time i love my grandmother dearly i always have and i always will but there was a part of my love for her that was dead for a very long time im grateful that this love has been resurrected shell be years old in a few months and she now has dementia im grateful to have deeply forgiven her even if i have my days where forgiveness becomes a daily or hourly choice that i have to consciously decide to choose all over again she was a woman from the south who had a father who loved her a husband who loved her she was never going to be able to understand she loved me maybe she thought i could protect myself because i fought him back that one thanksgiving i was a maybe a police report would have made my father look bad my mother blamed us both her words were you both embarrassed me in front of my mother i was a child my father was a yearold lb man ive forgiven my mother shes been dead for six years grief and acceptance and the acceptance of immortal grief with softness rage and beautiful sunrises and rainbows in between my inner child and i pray for peace for my father and for my heart to continue to choose in an act of selflove and in the spirit of deep healing and specialized selfcompassion the acceptance of facts forgiveness comes and goes and thats okay im grateful that he is far away from us we breathe easier now well forever have healing to do and things to learn deep introspection has become a friend to my loneliness ive developed a deep level of selfcompassion that for the longest time i didnt realize existed that i didnt know i deserved i continue to learn selfgrace i continue to learn selflove i have cptsd im grateful for the level of healing and selfacceptanceunderstanding that i have developed because of that i am returning to myself im grateful for the gift of solitude im also grateful for ouid and for my goodhearted cousin that sells it i am grateful for love i am grateful for strength i am grateful for boundaries i am grateful to have been given the knowledge help love and divine assistanceguidance that has gotten me to where it is that i am today i am grateful for the force that has kept me mentallyemotionally sane for the most part im grateful to be able to afford therapy im grateful for medication i can breathe easier now we know we we as in me and little deanna deserve true supportive honest and fun love from someone who will deeply love care for and cherish us we know we do not deserve to ever settle the man for us will be the one who will be fully invested in being a friend a partner and a lover he will be safe he will also be the one to naturally allow the protection of love for myself ive fought insanely hard to build accept and hold on to it will be an honest joy as i deeply know that it is already a joy a joy that i deeply deserve that i have always deserved until then i am grateful to hold space in my heart for the creation of my own joy,Positive
this didnt happen to me or anyone i knew but if say a mother hits a child repeatedly and the child one day hits her back is it allowed or is considered morally wrong ill censor the parts that include violence just in case it isnt that horrifyingly violent just some hitting and grabbing and some threats so lets say theres a girl named susan susan is a thirteen year old girl and her parents most specifically her mom gives her a lot of academic stress and would hit her a lot regarding it not when she gets a bad grade but when she wasnt trying hard enough or if she got a question wrong she would throw whatever textbook not the big textbook but the a ones with the thickness of maybe pages it was at her or would hit her head with it sometimes she would pull her shirt and hit her head sometimes she would threaten her that she would kick her out when she one time slack on her homework she had thrown bags at her to she could leave the house and die on the street susan also had a brother and was fully convinced that the brother was the mothers favorite she one day also told her that right now he was more important and that he was way lovely and cuter most of the time susan defied her mother and sometimes talked back one day her brother was constantly pestering her with weird and somewhat perverteddances and was kicking her despite her telling him to stop so she hit her brother on the knee then the mother started telling her to stop and walked towards her and raised her fist telling her to dont hit her brother she complained that her brother was keep pestering her and that she had every right to hit him on a regular basis susan also hit her brother sometimes without or with reason as normal sibling do her mother told her that she had also seen her hit him without reason as well and that susan should just ignore him because he was just joking around susan then told her that she had told him to stop multiple times before and that he wouldnt stop so the mother also told him that she would hit susan when she hit her brother the mother than hit her and susan blocked it she also tried to hit back and gave a small kick very very little since it felt wrong the mother exploded and screamed at her about what a foul creature she was are you a creature hitting your parent like that theres kids on the news that kills their parents and hit them you wanna go on the news of course this made no sense to her because to her eyes her mother was also a monster who hit her was child abuse not on the news then susan then told her that she had every right to hit her brother when he kept pestering her even when she was telling him to constantly stop after a while arguing about that the mother than pulled her shirt once agian and told her to get out of her house because she was scared that maybe susan would kill her when she grew up she then asked susan if she wanted to experience being beaten up so bad until the brink of death and that it was very possible for her susan was pushed to stand in front the front door and took two bags out of a closet nearby she threw it down at susans feet and told her to pack winter and summer clothes so she could go outside and die susan by this point knew that it would be hopeless and promised to maybe hit her back when she was a little bit older when she had more power so she apologized took a few threats and went into her room so based on this story was susan wrong for doing that or was she defending herself thanks for reading my loooongggg post,Positive

i will choose to stay anonymous for this post in case a family member or someone i know finds this im currently nb and have been starting to break away from my parents and their control and it feels amazing they finally somewhat respect me but only because of their selfish reasonsi choose to ignore it and continue on with my life when i was i discovered i could express my gender in ways outside of what i was told i could i was online a lot in elementary school but not to an unhealthy amount i just really liked minecraft that evolved into being on tiktok and all that junk when i got to middle school the influence of tiktok and the internet helped me realize im transnb i came out as trans when i was it is an understatement to say my parents hated me once i came out i hung out with other translgbt people which my parents did not approve of at all my parents didnt monitor my online activity so i easily got into things i wasnt supposed to they tried isolating me from my queer friends they took away all my electronics even my headphones for months this was devastating i have autism so removing everything that was comfortable especially my headphones was extremely detrimental to my mental health i had to keep my door open except for when i was changing and sleeping and i wasnt allowed to see my friends outside of who my parents approved of which was very little i basically had no friends and was extremely depressed to the point i attempted suicide at my parents argued with me about being trans and how they wouldnt support this illogical thinking they were so desperate to control my life that they tried sending me to a christian high school slight side tangent im heavily into music and band this high school did not have a band program they knew this and wanted to put me into that school anyway what were they thinking my dad once even told me he almost sent me to a military camp i was how could you say that to your teenage child im doing much better now they claim to have done those things in the name of my wellbeing and protecting me from what they believe is bullshit my parents are just hateful and completely unhinged i truly dont understand their reasoning this was mostly just a ventrant but is there any logical reasoning to their actions i dont understand edit grammar,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
in this post i will confess shameful and also peculiar aspects of my life combined with actions that continue to haunt me before i do however i plead that all those reading attempt to sympathize with my upbringing first ultimately i know that this also falls into my own hands and that i must first accept that before i can rid myself of years of selfinflicted harm all i ask is that your judgment which i am sure will follow at least considers my reasons first no matter how childish they may seem hello for my privacy i will not reveal my name and it is worth noting to all those reading that this is most likely being posted through a burner account i am posting this as not only a confession but also as a means for gathering advice while i still can to put it simply i am turning this year but i believe my life is already ruined and it is mostly due to my own actions when i was my mom transferred me to an online school program based on my unpopularity at school i was being bullied at school and she felt it was necessary to enter me into an online school to combat this issue at first i went along with this decision but a few weeks before starting i swiftly began to change my mind however this did not deter her and i found myself enrolled anyway prior to being an online school student i would say i was an average student and half of the time i received good enough grades this all changed when i was entered into the online academy that i am still unfortunately forced to attend from the beginning my family has offered little to no counselling when it comes to the work found within this program as long as i do my work on time and on time means in a period suitable enough to not have child protective services called on us then they are pleased in the first few years of being enrolled i of course happily took advantage of this instead of learning or prioritizing my education i instead spent all my time playing games or slacking off on my work soon enough it got to the point where i would have hundreds of overdue assignments piled up against me by the end of every semester when this time came i would have no choice but to knock them all out in a timely fashion thus i began to cheat which is incredibly easy considering you can find entire unit answer keys just by googling one question online in doing so i soon became reliant on cheating i had not enough time to learn the material and my parents seldom wished to help me if they did they constantly complained or berated me for my stupidity i know that this is also my fault but i beg you all to see that i know this unfortunately this is a notion that has only come to me in the past few years one might wonder where are your friends or peers well that is another issue my parents are overprotective and overdomineering as one might find it is also worth noting that they are both mentally ill they do not show much interest in my future or career yet they claim to only want the best for me by practically isolating me from the world we are also living off flimsy disability checks and struggling with transportation issues i have not a single person i can call a friend outside of the digital world and i now find myself struggling with social anxiety and depression i would say about two years ago i began to realize the gravity of my situation it has gotten to the point where i have forgotten almost everything i learned in the years i spent in public school and i continue to cheat on my online work if i were to stop cheating after years of relying on it i am most certain my future would be ruined beyond repair for subjects like english and history i would eventually find my footing however for subjects like science math and other things i feel the years of education and experience i have missed are crucial to my work and therefore i would fail miserably i realize my mistake i cannot stress this enough im blinded by it i would do anything to go back in time and reverse everything ive done in the past years of my life but i do not possess a time machine and i am soon to be an adult i have cheated for the past years of my life on most of my school work yet i have no intelligence or experience to show for it to the eyes of future employers i am a welleducated individual but i know now that i am nothing but a childish crook who has forgotten everything in math besides the most basic forms of addition the worst of all however is that for years i have implored my family to let me go back to public school before its too late to tutor me or to find me a tutor these pleas have been ignored time and time again and in some cases my family has even encouraged cheating just to silence the teachers who threatened to call cps i have reached the point where it is too late years of vital knowledge and experience i do not possess and i cannot simply start doing my work in certain subjects without possessing that very knowledge how can i a person who can barely remember their multiplication tables do high school math and succeed keep in mind that to make a living and receive decent enough job prospects in the future one must possess a formidable school record if there is one thing i can say for certain i only have myself in this case once i am an adult there will be no family to rely on when financial aid is needed there is only one way given my isolated situation and that is that i must find it in myself to learn and succeed outside of my online school this is what has led me to make this post i ask you all to give me advice on what to do and i beg that this advice is suitable enough given my circumstances i have access to a library although not terribly often but it works but what books do you suggest i check out readers keep in mind i not only need years of knowledge but also years of refreshment on knowledge i formerly possessed i do not possess a job or a means of transportation at the moment but i am actively attempting to solve that issue in the past year of my life i have slowly but surely built up a habit of reading classic literature and studying the books i read this has been of great help to me but this is not enough for the next two years of my life i need to relearn everything i have forgotten and then promptly learn everything i have missed when i have graduated i absolutely need to get into college and get the farthest away from my entire family as soon as possible i have the internet but what websites and apps do you suggest what books readers tell me everything pretend as if i am a caveman who needs to learn everything in two years in order to integrate himself into modern society in truth that is what i feel i am these days i take responsibility for my actions and the possibility that i am too late has dawned on me during many restless nights however i still have two years and possibly more during college please help me there is no going back to public school requesting the help of friends i do not possess hiring a tutor or escaping my family this is all on me and me alone but perhaps i can scrape by,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

ive been with my boyfriend for around years now and its been apparent that they heavily abuse him were in a long distance relationship but i have met up with him one time in real life even before then i knew they hated him because he was gay while they were heavily christian and wanted him to have a girlfriend i did my best to protect him when i visited but their controlling behavior is something ive never seen before many times theyd force him to spend time with girls around our age and force him to try and get in relationships with them and when he refused theyd get angry and take some belongings away after my first visit they decided to not allow me to return or him to visit me unless i came out to my parents so i did which was hard but then they changed the conditions to when i was which i recently turned once again they changed it to once my bf moves out as you can expect thats been really hard on us but we can work through it its only what happened recently thats broken our faith for some unknown reason his parents got upset so upset that they took allhis belongings away everything this includes his phone too they are doing everything they can to force him into being what they want that they are isolating him from me earlier today he got just his phone back and told me that his father forced him into a strip club got him so drunk he was blacking out and proceeded to force him to have sex with a stripper honestly when i heard it i was violent and angry just at his father my boyfriend has done everything he can constantly to appease their insane expectations and try to make peace but this just is too far ive already made plans to work my ass off until i can steadily give my boyfriend a place to live somewhere away from them but man this is really hard to just experience i love him so much and our relationship is one only seen in romance movies haha theres that unbreakable bond but his parents just constantly abusing him and breaking him down i just needed to vent this somewhere because i feel really useless and doing everything i can to find solutions or help,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
from another reddit but i feel like i posted it on the wrong one i have made several posts like this on reddit so feel free to read some if you want further context i f have a mother who has recently turned to conservatism and christianity i came out to my mother multiple times over the past years i was met with acceptance and she even bought me pride merch and offered to take me to pride we watched queer shows together she even told me she wanted to go to a drag show at one point now for the past year she has been telling me that im not gay and that im only saying i am for a sense of community this started in argument about how she hated trans people i told her she was being hateful and transphobic somehow i came out in the midst of everything the next day she told me she doesnt believe im lesbian and forced me to watch conservative youtubers talk about how the left is wrong and too sensitive then a couple days later i told her that what she said was hurtful and it hurt my feelings she said and i quote name i know you i know you better than you know yourself im right and youre wrong this shocked me and didnt make me feel any better months pass and this conversation topic pops up again this time with christianity in the mix she shows me videos of exqueer people turning to jesus and saying theyre done lusting after people of the same sex or having homosexual tendencies more recently she forced me to watch a candace owens video conservative youtuber talk about how the drag show at the olympics was a satanic ritual against jesus it was about a greek god but ok afterwards she makes me go in my room close my door as talk to me about the truth she tells me being queer shouldnt be my identity ridicules me and gay sex random she tells me she cant save me when i die and says that my girlfriend cant save me either in the end i broke down and cried in her arms not out of safety but i truly broke down at that point this was me surrendering but not to her now every chance she gets she talks about jesus and god and forced me to go to church and receive a prayer at the end of sermon which i told her multiple times i didnt want to receive she makes me listen to conservative christian podcasts about how people left witchcraft and the lgbtq community to love jesus and god forbid i look at my phone because she tells me to put it away and says its satan trying to make me stray away from god its truly suffocating and no one else in my household knows it luckily my parent are separated so i can stay at my dads house and far away from this seriously what do i do ive been told my mothers behavior is abusive or even narcissist but im still unsure,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i dont know if its considered abuse or something else but my mom is over yrs old and i was a later in life child of hers ever since i was little she would get into arguments or realize she was wrong about something and she will go completely mute she stares off into space and will sometimes wring her hands or twirl her hair into a knot against her head or bite her nails silently its almost like her eyes get really big and glossed over and her lips turn dark pinkpurple she usually rocks back and forth when this happens too then out of nowhere she will shriek at the top of her lungs its more like a roar and she will try to pull out her hair and sometimes clench her fists and swing her arms around she doesnt usually speak any words occasionally she has screamed run away or i cant stop while these fits happen the longest one was about forty five minutes and the short ones they happen more frequently are usually about ten minutes again this only happens if she is in the wrong for something or makes an obvious mistake that she realizes after the fact when shes done with these fits she has said she doesnt remember anything except feeling very angry and she will laugh and call it just blowing off some steam she has said she does not have full control of her body sometimes during the fits one time i had to call an ambulance because while she was having a fit she was clearly having trouble breathing it didnt stop her from doing the entire fit though they tried taking her vitals and one of them wasnt compatible with life i think it was blood pressure so they wouldnt leave until it came down because when they tried to get her to go to the hospital it got worse and she was fighting against the feeling of being sick during the fit too she has type diabetes and it has only recently started to get controlled after a fit that was more recent and her blood sugar was around ish she refused to go the hospital for a while though and when she got there about half an hour or so later it was she had been having these fits since an instance where she was raped by my dad in front of me i was about five years old im twenty eight right now that is just from my own recollection her sisters said she did this as a kidpreteen too her behavior has always seemed erratic and extreme and she cant sit still ever her family has a history of severe mental health issues and about three generations back all the women in her family were hospitalized andor institutionalized at least twice my mom sees a therapist who is very passive she is nice but not exactly like a therapist and more like a friend she says that her behavior is probably just a temporary thing she is going through and in regards to the fits she just has a lot on her plate right now but only has generalized anxiety and depression i have adhd probably aspie too anxietydepression and ptsd my moms diagnosis has never made sense to me or anyone i know she tries to sugarcoat and lie to her doctors but her therapist saw her have a fit once and actually initiated that an ambulance and police get sent to our house to help her from her end it was a video call what can i do my mom has likely suffered a ton but she refuses to speak about things and when she is frustrated she lashes out at me for her doctors not helping her she is very keen on scapegoating me from a young age and im aware of that part but i currently have no housing options outside of my parents house due to newer medical problems and occasionally my mental health issues still i dont think i can get through to her but i am frightened about what she may have i plan on going low andor no contact with my parents once i leave but im afraid of having a child of my own and potentially passing down something genetic or being a carrier of something myself her older sister has a rare form of dementia induced from trauma or medication and she is almost exclusively non verbal and in a nursing home does my moms behavior match anything that would show up on a genetic test or something had anyone else witnessed behavior like that from someone i dont really know how to come to terms with all the things ive seen from her sorry for the long post,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

long story short my girlfriend was sexually abused by her own parents for years when she was a child after that she went to a foster parent when she was so its really fked up when i found out i was crying for what feels like hours later i tried to talk to her i asked simple questions about how she feels about all of this after years she gave me very avoidant answers and she said she is fine and doesnt want to talk about it ever if she did she would probably break down and be depressed for months if not years after it of course after this i respected her decision and didnt push the topic i know i cant fix someone who doesnt want to get fixed but is there any other way to help her other than blindly accepting that she is fine as someone whos very close to her i know she has some serious problems in her life and in our relationship too that doesnt make her a bad person of course but it seems like she doesnt see any other options other than coping with avoidance,Positive
escambia county florida has unveiled a horrific tale of parental betrayal that can only be described as a nightmare straight out of a horror film meet christopher turney a former deputy who was supposed to protect and serve and his wife leandra turney who have turned their home into a house of horrors for their own children these two are not just bad parents they are monsters in human form arrested on charges that are nothing short of gutwrenchingchild cruelty child neglect and contributing to the delinquency of a minorchristopher and leandra have reached new lows that should make any decent persons blood boil what makes it even more infuriating is that christopher once a deputy sworn to uphold the law has now become a disgrace to the badge the nightmare began when deputies responded to a call at a church on mobile highway where a brave child revealed the harrowing truth this innocent victim had been subjected to physical abuse at the hands of christopher who allegedly unleashed punches to the face and choked the child until he gasped for breath let that sink in a man who once wore a uniform designed to protect is now the very embodiment of terror in his own home but the abuse doesnt stop there this child hasnt seen the inside of a classroom since being adopted in instead of getting an education he was forced to mow lawns and hand over his hardearned cash to christopher for groceries what kind of sick individual exploits a child for their labor its absolutely infuriating these two have taken the concept of parenting and twisted it into a grotesque parody treating their children like personal servants instead of nurturing them and as if that wasnt enough to make your blood boil deputies also spoke to another child of the turneys who claimed she was homeschooled but her version of homeschooling is a complete sham working on assignments for just hours a day under leandras socalled supervision is an abomination this poor girl didnt even know what grade she was in and had never been evaluated by a licensed teacher its a blatant violation of basic educational rights and these two are getting away with it to top it all off during interviews deputies noticed the girls teethblack with decay when asked about her dental hygiene she shamefully admitted she didnt even have a toothbrush and christopher in a shocking display of utter negligence claimed he was saving up money to buy her one are you kidding me this is a classic case of parental failurea blatant disregard for a childs wellbeing after their arrest the turneys were released from escambia county jail like it was a mere inconvenience with christopher walking out on a bond and leandra on picture them strutting out of jail as if theyve just won the jackpot completely oblivious to the outrage theyve caused in their community now lets take a moment to acknowledge the legal systems favorite phrase innocent until proven guilty while its a cornerstone of justice its frustrating to see it applied to a former cop who has betrayed the very principles he was sworn to uphold while we must allow for due process the allegations against the turneys are so grave that its hard not to feel a wave of disgust at their actions their next court appearance is set for august and its time for the justice system to step up and deliver a swift and harsh punishment to these heartless individuals they need to face the consequences of their abhorrent actions and understand that no child should ever have to endure the kind of torment they inflicted in conclusion christopher and leandra turney are not just bad parents they are a disgrace to humanity we must demand justice for these innocent children and ensure that the turneys are held accountable for their heinous actions its time to raise our voices and say enough is enough,Neutral

im just writing this so that i can hopefully stop being so angry tonight was really bad and was honestly the kick in the teeth i needed to form a plan to move out of my mothers house i have been since may nd of this year so not very long and i have been living with my mother to try and get my live together since my abusive father refused to treat me as anything other than a maid without pay i wasnt allowed to see doctors or anything of the sort tonight however was bad i plan on calling cps but my year old sister was being verbally attacked by my mother so i jumped in to try and calm everyone down and diffuse the situation that was a very bad idea instantly my mother and grandmother started screaming at me and then my grandmas roommate jumped in too all of them screaming at me saying im acting like my father calling me fathers name jr repeatedly with my grandma even acting like she was going to hit me almost after this i said i was leaving and i meant it though of course im going to form a plan beforehand my grandma told me i should go sleep in a ditch and that id never survive out in the real world on my own i dont think i have enough words to properly explain how fucking angry i am all i tried to do was help and i was verbally abused i was screamed at by three grown ass women who then proceeded to follow me into my room to continue the harassment after i left i cannot put into words how tired i am of being yelled at by an ex druggie my mother an ex convict my grandmother and a mooch her roommate i am tired of being the punching bag and then my mother tried telling me that i triggered them because i was acting like my father refusing to acknowledge that she was letting two elderly women verbally attack me and only focusing on how hurt she is of course i wouldnt be harping on the drugs and being an ex con if they werent abusive terrible fucking people ive even tried explaining to my mother that her behavior is abusive and she does not care of course why did i bother i really really do not like the people i live with i feel very guilty for saying this because theyre family or whatever but there is nothing more exhausting than literally screaming at the top of your lungs and it falling on deaf ears and im sure people here will be able to understand that better than anyone else and after all of this i was told to clean and sleep on my plans of moving out any tips for a plan to move out would be appreciated i did not leave my my fathers just to be screamed at by elderly women who only know how to complain about others and bitch and whine when someone has a different opinion i will not be attacked like this anymore tldr living situation bad need advice on plans to get the hell out,Positive

okay so im and i have a probably abusive dad but i just turned out so much different from my siblings and they all say its my fault who are and btw i cant lie and say i was a good child because i wasnt i was good in school excelling if you would but at home i was problematic like i would talk back not do stuff and i got beat for it and shit but because i acted out my siblings say its my fault i got it worse even though i was a child was when it was the worst and they were older than me and didnt tell me what was wrong or right and let me get shit for it now i dont talk to my parents as much and they obviously arent happy about it and expect me to just forgive and forget but i wont and as soon as im im leaving but my siblings wont and they want to stay and help and they say i need to too and the beatings and yelling was all my fault i dont think it was and i never really have they were the adults and i was a stupid child but my sisters really have me contemplating it and i dont want to dwell and start believing them but im just so unsure it makes me feel sick that i could be the product of my own mistakes,Positive
sometimes i find it hard to relate to some peoples stories my parents never withheld food or physically hurt me which makes it difficult to explain the wrongness of it all currently im my stepfather was in the military leading to us moving to places before we moved i personally thought things were idyllic my mom was a single mother but gave us a good life nonetheless she enrolled my sister and me into an international school to provide us with experiences she wasnt given as a child and give us good memories i obviously dont remember much of this because i was under she constantly tells my sister and me about the school experiences and vacations she gave us at such a young age when something is brought up like it completely trumps everything we said she was formerly a social worker meaning she saw extreme child neglect abuse etc she uses these as a comparison to our experiences which isnt fair to the situation its hard to think she doesnt know this i might be all around the place when i talk about some of these experiences bear with me please my mother had us around friends frequently and one time her friend undressed in front of my sister and me because she had a mental breakdown my mom put us back around her after a few months she told us she had a moment and she was okay now when we first moved my stepdad was barely home my mom was there but she wasnt very present if that makes sense she was completing her masters while taking care of two kids from th grade i had to make my lunch or i had nothing at school she never helped me but the food was there before this she packed my lunch daily i wasnt given too much guidance so sometimes i packed it and other times i didnt this led to me getting into really bad debt with the school i was so ashamed that i hid the notes until i joined an afterschool club which allowed us to eat after the activity i ate and they directly called my mother she was upset and told me not to eat after school or she would leave me there i didnt eat after school again i did end up getting skinny and bony but my mother would tell the doctors there was food and i ate all the time and nothing else came of it my sister had very poor grades during this time she would always have bad grades in general but she would punish her in very odd and cruel ways she would make me spy on my sister and see if she wasnt doing her schoolwork and when i reported back to her she would punish her one time she called her downstairs and asked if she was doing her work and when she lied she shoved her off of the chair and broke it in the process i dont remember anything about that event after that middle school ive moved again and im a bit of a problematic student im in a scholars school but because my home life is so bad my grades also suffer im not a class clown or anything but if anyone was paying attention something was off with me i never got into fights either i was just loud angsty but popular i was in cheer which was my only outlet other than school i kept my grades just barely above being on probation because this was the only thing i had but my mother didnt like bad grades by any means this meant i constantly had my phone taken and other punishments i wasnt a stupid kid i just couldnt focus at home i remember having a powerpoint due and i was on my computer trying to finish it then my parents got into an argument this wasnt out of the ordinary by any means then she poured water all over his computer he got up yelled at her and called her a few profanities then slammed the door leaving the house all of the while i was at the dining room table i looked up twice and went back to my work i guess someone noticed my behavior because one day i was called to the guidance counselors office she was kind a little weird but she cared i would look forward to seeing her and id tell her about my day and other things one day my mother was gone for a work trip and my stepfather was home i hated being at home with him he would drink all of the time and he wasnt nice he would always say im not an alcoholic they drink to get drunk i dont get drunk i was telling her about something and i went back to class apparently something i said was of concern because she called cps when my mother and stepdad got wind of it they were furious they told me if i wanted to leave so bad i could go and they would never see me again they then told me to never talk to her again or else after that i hated her i felt she had gotten me in trouble and i never spoke to her again i was depressed after a while i would never leave my room unless it was for food or maybe the bathroom i told my stepdad i was depressed because i thought i could trust him when i got home i realized he had told my mom she was angry and told me that if i wanted to kill myself do it and she pulled out pills and a gun from the bedroom and told me to take my pick i never confided in my family again years later i would get my answer as to why she did that her exhusband used to use suicide as a way to manipulate my mom and her immediate thought was that was what i was doing thats why she did that her explanation i hit myself in the head several times in anger causing myself to get a concussion but i lied and told them i fell to cause it years later and a bipolar diagnosis later ive been in therapy several other things have happened but i just never thought about it until sometimes when im just thinking itll come to me moments without remembering and it appears out of nowhere i tried to talk to my mother days ago about the lunch thing i thought that wasnt very fair and kind of neglectful she apologized and said she was in a loveless marriage and was going through things but apologized nonetheless fast forward to today she calls me upset she and my stepdad are on the phone she asks if i get a kick out of bringing up things from the past then she switches to i gave you food shelter and you never had to worry about the lights never turning on maybe you didnt have a bad enough childhood and now youre looking for stuff i put you in the international school most kids dont have that raising kids doesnt come with a handbook and when i get upset at her just calling to argue im disrespectful and if i was so horrible why am i still here most people would cut off their parents its moments like that where i cant even feel like im valid in anything and i rarely find stories like mine,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom was abusive while i was growing up i didnt really realize that she was abusive until a few years ago i knew that she abused me but not really that she was abusive if that makes sense i thought that abusive parents were abusive of the time but my mom would pretty much just constantly go back and forth between abuse and lovebombing in the last few years she hasnt been abusive anymore and still lovebombs im now and trying to fix myself my mom is always wanting me to spend time with her and the rest of the family and i feel really bad about it but i am pretty uncomfortable around her and just dont want to most of the time she was the only one that was abusive to me i would fight with my brother but we were kids and that was normal i feel so bad for avoiding the rest of the family just because shes there i also feel bad that shes the one i talk to the most i guess im comfortable calling her on the phone it does often worsen my mood but she answers the phone and i dont really have anyone to talk to so i call her i would like to go to therapy but ive been to so many and they were either useless actively made things worse or moved away after a few sessions i had to go to therapy growing up to but it wasnt ever really for me my mom would go sit next to me and do all the talking until i was and able to go alone idk really even where im going with this i guess maybe im just trying to vent but if anyone had any little bits of advice or can relate at all it would be nice thanks,Positive

he constantly finds ways to berate and nag them he insists that theyre weird and need to be fixed he regularly invades their personal space and bombards them with stimulation he constantly demands they work more hours even when they work full time setting impossible expectations he makes payments with their card without asking he frequents fox news and rants about wokeness hes even occasionally attempted to take their phone and see who theyre talking to for years now the rest of their family also deals with his mania and threats to some extent but so gets the significant brunt of it whats even worse is my so suffers from severe ocdsuspected which forces nonstop intrusive thoughts about death time passing and growing old among other horrible things it even emulates their dads ramblings overstimulating them and forcing them to dumb down their thoughts and essentially succumb to insanity their dad just sees it as them being depressed and doubles down on the stimulation while refusing to let them pursue medication or counseling because again he frequents fox news you figure that one out this has been going on a long time and while the severity fades in and out yesterday it reached a boiling point seeing the state so is in now i feel like i cant sit idly by anymore im nearly in a position where i could get a place with them even support them on my own income but the problem is hes so deeply entrapped that its hard to know whats the best way to extract him finances have been tight for the family especially with how he struggles to hold down a job so it feels like theres this expectation that they need to stick around indefinitely and continue supporting the family with their modest income so theres the potential concern that without so the family may struggle further or at least their dad could use that as leverage hes made threats to divorce before and theres fear among the rest of the family that he may do so or perhaps disown so if theres significant pushback but then again he has yet to make a severe decision like that and it seems its only the threat of that that keeps the rest of the family in line plus he doesnt know about me yet so theyre worried that dropping the news could enrage him but still it feels to me like so and their family are kept in check by fear when in reality theres surely something they can do to put him in his place and stop the insanity im just not sure how to go about helping it happen without potentially setting him off in a bad way,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi so im an international student at a uc university i grew up pretty privileged tbh the only thing was my physically and verbally abusive mom and emotionally absent and egotistical father essentially i have been going though turmoil and i just completed my second year of university as a woman in stem my gpa is currently at a b average which is not too bad but given that i was a straight a student i am capable of doing really well the issue is that my gpa is not good enough for my father and he is now refusing to send me back to university mainly because the money is my grandparents from my trust fund and it hurts his ego to ask for the money because he believes it is his duty to support me he is putting his ego before his daughter and i dont think i can ever forgive him for this even my mother believes in me just not my father the issue is that i wish to take on student loans to complete my education and im not sure it is worth it will it financially cripple me for the next years i believe in myself and i know i can do well on my own but are student loans worth the risk,Neutral
i have been raised in a broken family with a lot of mental and physical issues i have been beaten more than i can remember and sometimes it even left me with fractures but it is not the most traumatizing part but rather the incidents where i saw my father abusing and assaulting my sister and my nanny can someone please help how can i move on and get on with my life and live a normal life,Positive
my mom was both physically and emotionally abusive towards me as far back as i can remember until she threw me out of the house at she threw the newspaper at me and said that i had days to get out i had no car no money and only a parttime job since i had no car i asked her if she would take me to see a few places and she refused weve never had a relationship since to her i deserved the punishments as she liked to call them because to her i brought them on myself i am the black sheep of the family none of my siblings will speak up as to how she was anyways i never moved back home and only rarely spoke to her i just found out she had a second stroke from a family member i never knew she had a first stroke the thing is i dont feel sad or worried for her and i dont really care when i think about the fact she could die then i get sad but i wouldnt even go to her funeral if she were to die how can i not care about her yet be saddened that she might die she doesnt even know that im aware of her situation because in her words im dead to her has anyone experienced something similar is something wrong with me for not caring am i just a cold person,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my parents beat me not extremely often but when they are upset with me yesterday my brother came into my room and scared me crawling on all fours in the dark so i screamed because thats a normal reaction to being shocked it just so happened that it was around an hour before my parents had to get up and get ready for work because of the scream my mom woke up and got mad and told me i would be going to work with my dad since i wanted to keep people up i didnt want to go because its a very long boring day and they took my phone which i barely ever even have so basically once she realized i wasnt going no matter what she began beating me first with a wooden back scratcher and then an electrical fly swatter i was also stripped naked before this because she was planning on force dressing me since i didnt want to go so basically i was getting beat naked part of one of my braids was ripped out aswell my back had her hand print on it and i couldnt fight back because i was trying to also cover my body with whatever i could she slapped me multiple times it was humiliating i told her i didnt want to get dressed in the living room since it was uncomfortable i even explained why i screamed and she didnt care my brothers punishment was to clean his room which he also did not do she favors him over me and my other brother this is not the first time my brother has done something and gotten away so easily this happens all the time i am and my friends are suggesting i come with them or call police but my parents tell me cps will just tear our family apart and that i will get adopted by rapists my mom took all my money out my credit card and my phone i have no idea what to do edit thanks to everyone who is giving me advice i still do not have access to my phone but they havent hit me since i am hoping they change because the next time this happens i will be moving in with my friend and her mom,Positive
im simply here with questions as im not so sure if i should stay in my current family so since ive started life my mother has constantly said that id never get anywhere with my attitude and that im lazy or how if i wasnt born shed be doing much bigger things constantly compares me to others and insults me and my father daily this happens at the slightest of thing eg if i forget to wash the dishes or some other chore at the same time she says she does all that because she loves me and if i try to pull away from her emotionally and physically then she says im like the children who leave their parents and dont appreciate their efforts i was constantly beaten as a child which i though was normal until another relative who also participated in the beating talked about how beating traumatizes the child my father didnt want anything to do with me when i was born he has gotten better but i still doubt him someone in the family tried to commit but no sympathy was given instead the relative was insulted i live in a christian family and im not comfortable with their view on others who arent christianim an atheist somehow there are other matter but i would say these are the main issues i cant say this hasnt impacted me as i dont wish to live anymore but im simply wondering if im just spoilt,Positive
this is a lifelong healing process and i need help i am losing my mind processing this on my own when i f was a baby my dad molested my older sister who was at the time i didnt grow up with him but he would call every day and he would send money for child support i thought he was okay but didnt really understand his role in my life my mom told me what he did when i was about years old but she wasnt delicate about it in the slightest my mom has a lot of mental issues and is a chaotic person mind you she told me coldly with no emotion casually one afternoon i was shocked and i cried my sister was there too and she just kinda shrugged it off i was so perplexed at how my sister and mom could be so casual about it and of course not offer any type of emotion to me a year old finding out her dad is a pedo so that was traumatizing and fucked me up my family never wanted to talk about it so i held it in i even asked my mom to take me to therapy and she did take me to one session where i swiftly told the therapist wtf had happened mind you i was but we never went back why did i have to push for therapy for myself at age my mom always buried it and made it an after thought she never liked to think about it my dad would text and call often and i never ever replied for years and years the only thing was that my dad lived with my grandma he was her caretaker i loved my grandma a lot so when i was i went back to his house to visit my grandma then we didnt speak again my mom and my sister were very aware of my suffering my sister the victim literally told me that it was in the past and that i should have a relationship with him if i wanted same with my mom my sister even empathized and said he probably was abused when he was a kid then around i moved to la and my dad told me my grandma was sick and maybe going to die soon so i came to the hospital and his house then we would get lunch and started talking and thats when i went into denial and compartmentalizing i stored away the knowledge of that and wanted to get to know my dad for the first time turns out we got along really well and we were really similar this is what i am so ashamed of how could i have veered off path like this for a second and not have held the boundary my grandma being sick was the catalyst then i needed a couch to crash on and i crashed on his for months my grandma was sick and i was living in this delusion or maybe not a delusion just different side of my dad i wanted to have a dad and we got along well this was for about two months and again i am so ashamed of this even though my sister and mom were happy i was having a good relationship with him fast forward a year i had long moved out and i finally finally wrote my dad a text telling him i know what he did and that hes dead to me and i blocked him but it seeps in my mom speaks to him she said she and my sister forgave him long ago but hes never apologized to me or acknowledged it my mom and sister are obsessed with not living in the past aka denying any mention of past traumas maybe repressing my mom also told me he was very regretful and found the church after the incident apologized to my mom and sister but again none of this has been explained to me formally i feel like offhanded doesnt count my aunt his sister and i are close and i think she knows and also doesnt acknowledge it i have no idea if there have been other incidents but i get the vibe hes pretty reformed especially since he became more and more his moms caretaker full time but maybe thats just wishful thinking i seem to be the only one affected by it anymore its like impossible to cut ties completely it feels like because hes in the life of family members in my life and idk who knows and who doesnt and it fucked me up so badly to have to say i dont get along w him and wonder that its so so so so awkward aside from that recently my grandma died his mom today was the funeral my mom came down i fixed myself to go i loved my grandma i tried to mentally prepare myself for weeks ahead to see him no idea what i would do or what it would feel like today the day came i couldnt sleep last night nothing to do with my grandma completely to do with the torture of my dads past actions i cried the entire way to pick my mom from the hotel and i saw her and told her im not well and i better not go she kind of understood but then she gave me a talk about the past defining us and i told her im not over this and she has to respect this besides she hasnt really been there for me she either pushes it aside tells me to get over it or randomly decides to be upset about it in a very chaotic way i would say at me not with me and like i said my mom has problems of her own none of which as grave as my dads but shes been verbally abusive probably has bpd and has often used youre crazy like your dad as a deep jab at me during particularly heated moments anyway surprisingly my mom kind of respected me but we got to the funeral and i decided to give it a try i saw my dad and we were in front of his mothers urn and it felt too awkward not to hug so i gave a light hug and he started sobbing into my shoulder wtf it was so loaded hes never expressed emotion like this before it was so awkward and fucking weird then he tried to talk to me casually how dare he then i fucking left and said i was sick now im in my moms hotel room with a pounding headache after sobbing for a while ive been in therapy for years about it and im still so lost i feel gross and shameful for some reason how could i have ever spoken to him again after i knew how can i let anyone let him live in peace am i an enabler aside from that incident i actually feel bad for him for the other circumstances of his life being alone and estranged daughter i actually felt bad for him crying in front of his mothers urn even tho at the same time he fucking deserves it im the first one to say kll rpsts etc but when its your dad god does it fuck you up how is this my dad is it horrible that i still care for him a bit despite this am i a pedo sympathizer i have no idea how restorative processes work for these situations i likely may never ever speak to him again it fucks with my sense of self i dont know what to say can someone help me process this fucked up clusterfuck of emotions my friends say they are here for me ive told a couple but i honestly i feel ashamed when i do its exhausting and scary to disclose like they will look at me differently for feeling conflicted in some ways or handling it differently than they would or for not just closing the door forever but it feels more complicated than that cuz it would feel like id have to close the door to our mutual family members context im from a latino family its very emotionally incestuous and guilt trippy a sort of collectivism i suppose i definitely feel ostracized for not accepting the status quo im gonna continue living with my boundary but spiritually how do i deal with thishow do i live with myself tbh how have yall dealt with this why do i feel such a heavy shame i am gonna get therapy again but yall know thats a process just help im fucked up,Positive
hey guys just some general context about myself im yo living with my parents making my own money have siblings and consider ourselves living decently lebanon and its financial crisis if you know the thing is i have a small issue with my parents and how strict they are with me and potentially with my siblings cant judge since theyre much younger than me but somehow somehow i get a rejection from my parents whenever i ask them that i want to go out with my friends mainly from my mother my father is chill about that but i still receive some words now and then this shit been happening since i was in school had to come back home at pm then or else my mom would start panicking now theyre lenient more about it but at am i gotta be home at max no i dont do parties probably because its not my thing and i also understand them checking up on me but it comes out from them aggressively every time i politely ask my parents that i wanna go out most of you will say wtf this guy is and still asks his parents to go out yes i do because theyre my parents and i have to respect them the answers i receive are no need to go out stay at home tell them you cant make it etc i consider myself an introvert because im not a very social person my friends circle is very small and during my time at uni i made friends and cutoff my contact with my school friends which made me spend around years at home isolated nobody to talk to just as my mother thinks is right and normal every time i go out without the ok from my mother which is always the case lol we stop talking and she starts to ignore me as if im not her son and as if im not living with them and everytime i have to back to her like a dog and apologize knowing that nothing is wrong about what i did i have already explained to her eno im doing nothing wrong my friends are good people but she disregards all of this she just wants me to stay at home and do nothing moving out is not an option as i cannot buy a house what do i do its super affecting my behavior and its draining me from inside,Positive
i fem no longer live with my family but my younger sister still does we have been texting and she has been telling me about the things our father had been saying to her and i would like to hear your opinions if this is inappropriate because in my eyes his attitude and the things he is telling her is unacceptable my sister is vegan and already has mental issues such as depression and an ed which comes from her always taking blame on everything and thinking problems start because of her i used to think this is just an unhealthy habit she had adapted but im starting to think it is my dads fault she texted me a couple days ago telling me that he has been telling her that she spends too much money on herself and should be ashamed he said this knowing about her medical history of therapy about taking too much blame on herself causing her to sh for context my family is currently on vacation in america this is the only time she can buy things out of europe and go to shops she had never been to she is also a teenager who is interested in beauty and fashion this might not seem too bad but this is not the only thing he has been saying he has also been blaming financial struggles on her even though our family is well off he has been telling her that he will throw away all her belongings so she stops spending time on herself and do all of the chores instead she does to chores when asked and this is a teenager who wants to spend more alone time he has been telling her shes a waste of money and complains when she needs bucks for one outing every month she saves most of her money and only goes thrifting she also is a vegetarian and cannot eat meet since when she tries she feels guilty and pukes it out our dad even then gets mad at her for not eating it and pressures her which makes her take blame therefore she then start refraining from eating anything thinking she isnt worthy of the food and should starve herself she is in a terrible situation i would like to know if i should force my father to have therapy since he is clearly not trying to improve thank you for hearing me out i am sorry about my grammar english is not my first language,Neutral

tw mentions of suicide self harm my mom is not all mentally there she suffered from encephalitis a few years ago and her brain has never been the same since now whenever we have a slight argument she starts screaming about how she wishes she died in the hospital today i needed to use both my arms and grab her because she was mere inches from the knife block she regularly informs all of us about how she fantasizes about killing herself in my room so i remember it she told me today after our argument that even though dad hid his guns she is going to find other ways to do it i dont know how much longer i can take this right now shes sobbing and screaming to my father about how much shes been planning what can i do,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i f am very close to my mom f now but i absolutely hated her growing up she was both emotionally and physically abusive i somewhat understand why nowshe was going through a lot and was essentially a single mom raising not only her kids but also my sisters kids we lived in a small house she was making much less money etc however some things i just cant get over and i get so angry about them theres one specific memory that i just dont understand the only reason im thinking of it now is that my husband and i want to redo our yard anyway my mom had a row of small hedges in our front yard with rocks underneath randomly she would decide that my sister and i had to remove the tiny fallen leaves from the hedges out of the rocks she would make us get up super early in the morning while she went to work stop us when it got hot and then make us go back out in the evenings one time the fair was down the street so people would park on our street and walk by us and we had to watch them with envy i really feel like she did this to torture us because i dont see any other reason to have your elementary daughters do this leaves fall why have rocks somewhere if you dont want leaves in them even if we made it perfect leaves would fall right back in i understand that teaching your kids yard work is good i know she had to do yard work growing up like pulling weeds but doesnt this specific task sound insane and cruel was she trying to make us as miserable as she was this may not be abuse but its something or am i just being a crybaby though were close now i cannot even mention the way she was in the past because she immediately gets super defensive,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
trigger warning suicide emotional and physical abuse im at a loss as to what to think or do or how to process this my abusive father who had not spoken to me for years killed himself on my birthday there are two options one is that he didnt know it was my birthday likely as he rarely remembered or he knew and i dont know why he wanted to hurt me im on an emotional rollercoaster but im also not sure what do i tell my kids my siblings have had contact even though it was challenging for them so the suicide and all will come out i just dont know what to say to a and year old who didnt even know him but they will hear stories so i need to address it with them,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i literally cannot do this anymore i hate my father i hate him so much i always have i hated him when he would deprive me of lunch until i was able to speak i hated him when he would make me choose between getting beaten with a brush or a belt i just cant man i cant live like this anymore everyone says move out when youre eighteen but where would i go i have no family in state i have no financially stable friends and i dont see my mom getting a divorce anywhere in the near future i know he knows i hate him i know he knows my brother and my mother hate him as well i just dont know why he wont leave i literally think in the near future ill genuinely hurt him or myself if one of us doesnt leave,Positive
he has cheated on her wife beated me insulted my intelligence yelled at me forced me to be a sports champion which being genuine to you i didnt enjoy until i got away from sports as a whole he treatened me with an enrolling in the military the country i live has awful military tactics he always belittled my trophies he insulted me while being both at the top of my class and an academic genius according to my teachers only because he thought i should be what he never was a soccer player which is to me a boring sport i began to have some feelings that lead me to hate sports as a whole in comparisson to sports i think are cool mostly boxing and mma even when i would never practice that profesionally sometimes i wish my mom married that korean bussiness man instead of the politician jerk my dad is is it somehow wrong to just want to stab him even when i am aware i wont do that due to my values and laws being against it,Neutral
i have a very emotionally abusive mother who is very manipulative and has made my life very hard she wants me to go with her on a road trip and i dont think i can handle the pressure of being with her for multiple days on end i know if i dont go she will either go alone and never stop making me feel guilty for not going with her or she wont go at all and make me feel guilty because she didnt go on vacation someone give me advice,Neutral
got woken up yelled at made to feel guilty and reprimanded by my father today for having the audacity to sleep at an hour that he doesnt think is normal for the record im an adult and i have huge sleeping problems and some nights i barely get any sleep so my sleeping schedule is really difficult and i had finally fallen asleep for a bit in the afternoon before he woke me up and it was to be rested for something he needed me to do no less anyway it made me think about everything and it just made me realize that i trust any random stranger more than either of my parents i would not trust either of my parents enough to tell them what i am currently sharing here i would not trust them to share pretty much any of the stuff ive shared on reddit there is i think not a single person that i trust less than my parents to share my feelings with hell i wouldnt even trust them enough to share the fandom stuff i post on here decent chance theyd criticize make fun of or denigrate me for it might get angry im doing that instead of something better of course its not hard to tell why i dont trust them to share my feelings my father will throw my feelings back in my face dismiss them reprimand or denigrate me maybe while yelling at me if he feels like it that day my mother may sometimes act somewhat understanding to my face at least when shes not in a yelling mood or argues or throws a tantrum but even then will either do nothing or use them later to try to manipulate me behind my back recently i talked to chatgpt about some of the stuff thats happened with them and then i had it list what the longterm consequences of that might be on a child if they experienced that during their entire childhood the ai listed low selfesteem anxiety depression trust issues difficulty setting boundaries social problems learned helplessness perfectionism and fear of failure emotional dysregulation physical health issues such as headaches and avoidant behaviours which is just yeah i pretty much have all of those except trust issues with people except my parents and these things are basically the root of every single thing that has made my life miserable for the last ten years ive struggled with my mental health for a long time and for a long time i just thought i was kind of fucked up in some fundamental way but over the last few years ive learned that no probably not i was probably born as mentally healthy as the majority of children but i was just broken down completely by parents who constantly yelled at insulted criticized emotionally manipulated etc me throughout my entire life and if it wasnt for that id probably be living a happy productive life right now instead of severely depressed unemployed alone and barely able to go out due to anxiety its a bitter realization though it does help put things into perspective,Positive
my parents have given up on me according to them they i remind them of everything they failed at as a parent and they no longer want me around they cant kick me out so now theyre trying to get me to end it myself they did this in the past and were close to succeeding they find every little thing im doing wrong and they knit pick and dont stop until i am diminished to nothing they left me a card on the table and im pretty sure its something about how the will no longer be funding me at school and how much of a failure i am im just tempted to throw it out or open it then end myself im closer to ending it then i ever have before i have nowhere to go no friends and strong kick in the ass asholes i hate them so much i dont understand why me being a live is to much of a privilege,Neutral
i f have been contemplating this for some time and not sure if this is a correct term to say my dad is a narcissist i will be using fake names just in case if this happens to show up on youtube or facebook during my childhood my dad never really spent time with me at most it was forced by my mom and usually it was out of necessity rather than wanting to as early as i can remember my dad never spent time with me as he did with my older siblings abigail fake name and luke fake name when they came over my dad was neglectful at most i would do things on purpose to get in trouble because to me at the time it was a way to get some form of attention from my father rather than none at all as a child we struggled financially my dad would spend every dime on my two older siblings i suppose to make sure they had a good time with my dad many times my mom stole food from the jobs she worked at so we could at least have a proper meal growing up my mom and dad had martial issues and at most it was usually when my dad spent all of the money on my two older siblings while we mom myself and little sister struggled there were times she had to ask my grandparents to assist her in getting diapers and groceries for us i guess my mom had a hard time trusting my dad after he cheated on her when i was months old so that may have been part of their issues the water was turned off around that time because my dad again would spend our funds on my older siblings and we also had no heating cps came to the house because of it and we were nearly removed from my parents care until my grandparents moms parents stepped in to help my dads family didnt like my mom per of what my mom told me but im not really sure because i cant ask her and i refuse to speak to my dads side of the family at the age of we all packed up and moved to ohio my dad mom myself little sister and my baby sister my mom was basically a stay at home wife and tried her best to do the best she could she had postpartum depression maybe even severe and instead of my dad getting her help or at least being a supportive husband he cheated on my mom with his coworker at the time now mind you my mom had her suspicions he was cheating but could never catch him until one night they got into a huge fight i dont remember much of the details because it has been years however that night my dad brought home his coworker and how the house was set up there were three bedrooms upstairs and a bedroom in the basement the bedroom was directly beneath their room and my mom could hear everything i didnt find out these details until much later on in life but it opened my eyes to things i didnt really know as a kid that following weekend my dad took us three girls to his coworkers house and we all stayed the weekend there at the time things were really fun and we all enjoyed ourselves his coworker had three children of her own and we all become friends rather quickly when we came back home i wanted to stay again over the weekend and asked his coworker if i could but i had to ask my mom my mom was washing dishes and i asked her if i could stay in which she told me to pack my sht and get the fck out again i was at the time so it hurt and i didnt understand what i did it blew up into a huge fight in which my mom grabbed a knfe and my dads coworker grabbed the baseball bat my dad told her that if both of them got arrested he would bail out his coworker before he would bail out my mom in which my mom left the following day years later i found out from my mom she had left a letter for all of us but we never saw it much less knew of it existence until my mom told me during the divorce myself and my little sister had to stay at my aunts house for the summer and it was fun probably the most fun i had during that time it changed once my cousin saed me there are some things i remember that night but some things are a huge blur i still dont know to this day how i was back in my bed before my aunt got up my aunt wanted to adopt my little sister and me but my dad said no and took us back home the first two years with my dads coworker yes he was still with her deedee real name because she doesnt deserve to have a fake name were good she was my second mom though we didnt do much things together but my mom was basically mia so she filled in where my mom didnt over time things started to change she would treat me differently compared to my siblings accuse me of stealing money forget to feed me and left me in the care of her mom while my siblings got new things i was given hammy downs or things from goodwill her mom didnt like me at all she would say mean and hurtful things to me once while she was babysitting me she forced me to stand in the corner just because i got off the couch to get a glass of water im not entirely sure how long i was standing in the corner but i asked her if i could come out she told me if i asked again she would whoop my bottom some time went by and i asked her again if i could leave the corner next she lifted me up and threw me across the room thankfully there was a couch pressed up against the wall otherwise i wouldve been thrown out the window i told my dad and for once he actually cared deedee and my dad got into a huge fight about it and her mom never watched me again however the treatment toward me never changed only got worse from that point on my step siblings and my bio siblings were able to do whatever they wanted while i was still being accused of everything under the sun given a nickname teresa jr told i was going to end up like my mom i would never amount to anything i was worthless and no one cared about me in which suppose no one did because my dad allowed it to go on for years i was cinderella the only difference was i didnt sleep on cinders during this time there was a moment i stole from school which how are you stealing if its given to you for free the school i was going to in ohio we were given free lunches and i would take home the orange juice cartons from school my siblings were doing it as well so i figured why not but in hindsight i shouldve known better i was struggling with my homework and being able to do it because i was also caring for my step mom perfectly healthy and my siblings my teachers looked through my book bag and found cartons of orange juice which i guess you could say i was depressed and they called up my dad and step mom when i got home they kept yelling at me and asking if i was stealing i swore up and down i didnt steal my dad threatened me and told me that if he found out i was stealing he would have something waiting for me when i got home the next day i spoke with the lunch lady and apologized for stealing she didnt understand what i was apologizing for since it was freely given to me and i could do whatever i wanted with it somehow my dad and step mom found and when i got home later on that day there was a stack of rulers waiting for me brand new and sitting on the table wooden ruler with the metal stripping wrapped around it and spanked me with it if one broke the others were there to be used as well my siblings were also taking things from the cafeteria but i was the only one who was punished for it i was grounded and was forced to go to bed early every night until my dad said i was off punishment my siblings would rub it in and laugh at me for it there were many things that were questionable and maybe cps should have been involved which they did when i got into highschool things were ramping up with my step mom and she would accuse me of being sexually active because i didnt have a period most months i would have a period and some i wouldnt i nearly died twice because of me bleeding for months at a time my dad never questioned it but would still get me female products my dad at the time left her and i thought it was for good but he brought her back for a time she noticed i was extremely pale and wouldnt swim with the others for once she cared and scolded my dad for not noticing and they rushed me to the hospital turns out you can die from losing too much blood from your monthly they needed to do a emergency blood transfusion and god did i hate it but knowing all of this and being there for me she still accused me of those things in highschool i had an accident during my monthly the school called her and she didnt pick me up until after school and berated me all the way home she told me that she didnt pick me up from school or bring me a change of clothes was because i had done it on purpose and that she was going to let me suffer my dad was selective when he cared and yelled at her for it yes they did get married and yes they were way too toxic for one another she started accusing my dad of cheating in which he was and gifts he received from his job she would destroy it they got a divorce some time later and we moved to florida with a friend my little sister started bullying me some time after that ive always struggled with my weight and my little sister was allowed to get away with it sisters will be sisters or shes just teasing you grow up she was never scolded for this behavior and would continue on until we moved to indiana and there after suppose it was because he had his doubts if my little sister was actually his a story for another time and so she was also allowed to get away with things dictate who my dad dated if he drank etc basically being like his wife which to me is weird my dad and i was never close after that despite trying to act like he was my savior because of a dream he had in which he has told other people a different story why he left his ex wife i was forced to work a baby sitting job because my dad refused to buy things i needed for school while as he handled things for my little sisters new clothes new school supplies etc i wasnt allowed to have a formal job which is understandable because i struggled with school but never got the help for my school work my dad always had an excuse but was more than willing to help my sisters with their school work there was a time in high school when i was looking of colleges because i wanted to better myself and do something with my life my dad saw i was looking up colleges and asked why are you bothering with that when you can barely pass highschool i was absolutely torn and stopped looking up colleges at that point i realized back then that nothing i ever did was good enough even when i was doing very well in school ohio i had a gpa but changed from the constant moving and needing to take care of my siblings i was barely home and preferred to stay at my friends house rather than go home because all i ever got was abuse and neglect from my family i told my grandma dads mom i wanted to be a police officer really a forensic psychologist and my grandma laughed in my face and told me i was too fat to be a police officer i had no support from anyone neither side of my family and my dad along with my siblings made life worse for me and complicated it was hard to make friends in school most thought i was weird but usually had a very small group of friends during this time myspace was widely known and i added my older sister as a friend i tried everything i could to be closer to my older sister but she wanted nothing to do with me one day she tried calling up my dad and she couldnt get ahold of him im not entirely sure why but she contacted my grandma about me being bisexual i wasnt ready to come out to my dad yet adam lambert was my idol and i looked up to him because he was my inspiration although i still wasnt ready but i was going to tell my dad however my grandma beat me to it on my way home from school my dad called me and yelled at me and told me i wasnt bisexual and that it was just a phase my dad refused to speak to me after that for months i told my mom and i expected her to be the same as my dad however she wasnt in fact i will always remember these words until the day i die no matter who you fall in love with you will always be my daughter no matter what and ill welcome whomever you fall in love with open arms man or woman i cried over the phone with my mom and told her everything she was disappointed with my dad and i stayed with her over the weekend my mom wasnt in my life much but when she was it meant a lot to me my dad met someone new during this time though she was already with someone but thats a story for another time and they started seeing each other as i mentioned my mom wasnt always in my life but when she was it meant a lot however the times i really needed her she was never there or would come up with some form of an excuse as to why she couldnt be there my step mom sat in my moms seat during the day of my graduation and im very grateful for that because it meant a lot to me however my dad kept trying to push on to me that she was my mom and i should call her mom ever since my dads ex wife ive not been able to view another woman as mom because of the abuse i went through for years while my dad allowed it to happen until he got tired of the treatment put on to him we would fight about it until i cut contact with him i moved to florida after i graduated highschool to be with a boyfriend i met online not all relationships are like this but the last two before i met my husband they were abusive cheating on me and other things when i needed help i couldnt depend on my dad and still cant my dad has told people who were going to help me she got herself into this mess she can get herself out of it so they would leave me until i was able to get myself out of it and anything was better than what i was dealing with when i moved back to indiana and moved in with my grandma she thought i was using her because of my older sister decided to put into her head that i was just going to use people i was trying to rebuild a relationship with my dad and fix things however she kicked me out and told me to get the fck out to this day i havent spoken to her my dad and step mom were trying to put stipulations on me friends i could hang out with being online etc and i moved in with my best friend at the time however things werent going great and i asked if i could move back in of course my step mom had to say something and told me what makes you think you can move back in my dad would rather put me in a homeless shelter rather than help me but he has helped my other siblings than me and no as far as i know im my dads child so the ill treatment is beyond me during covid my mom passed away and it was hard for me extremely hard my husband has told me i was basically in shock i lost most of my hair because of the stress and i just couldnt be a human most of that week is a blur and i couldnt go to my moms funeral because of funds and vehicle issues my dad told me during that week if your mom didnt have the issues she had we would still be together im not sure what he was trying to gain from that but it tore me to pieces when he told me that he has a habit of painting himself out to be a victim will wave his masters degree in your face but not use it i went nc with my dad step mom siblings and his whole side of the family including my moms side of the family my moms side of the family is for another day i gave my dad another shot nearly years ago and wanted to meet up for a family trip my husband doesnt like my dad but wanted to give him a chance for me i told my dad i had quit smoking during that time and he asked me if he makes me feel anxious which i was honest and told him yes he did he decided to tell me well i hope we dont cause you to smoke again i hung up and didnt speak to him until years ago my husband and i were having marital issues and hoped he would let me stay with him for a time but he told me he couldnt because they have no money and he would have to ask mary fake name i knew where it would lead and havent bothered to call him ever since and yes hubby and i are still together and just celebrated our year anniversary there are times i want to call him and just talk to him tell him about my day and tell him just how things are i think it stems from losing my mom and how much we would call and talk to each other before i cut contact with her before she passed away however talking to him about past things has got us no where at the end of the phone call i usually end up in tears because he just tells me im sorry if you feel that way when i told him about the sa from my cousin he told me i dont know what to believe and what do you want me to do about it along with his wife get over it so im asking you reddit is my dad a narcissist or am i putting a label on him that is now becoming a common label for many people should i try giving him a chance i apologize for the long post,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mother has given me permanent anxiety and paranoia since theres a door blocking the ground floor and the little area housing the door to the backyard and the stairs to her apartment in the basement and i live on the ground floor she will rapidfire bang on the door and will yell at me if i dont open it in seconds and that gives me anxiety that any little small and insignificant bang is her at the door which its not her i cant listen to my favorite songs because the drums give me anxiety and paranoia thinking that its her at the door i have to live in complete silenceapart from the ambience of the town i live inso i can listen to hear if she bangs at the door so i can run and answer it my grandparents are control freaks and its their house so that door has to be locked at all times so i have to keep it locked because they are letting me live here for free so i feel bad for breaking any rules and try to follow them to the best of my ability but my mother is driving me crazy it feels like i have to get up to open the door for her every other hour,Neutral

im a year old boy in north carolina with a younger sister my parents have been scolding me for no apparent reason and often put me down they say that i have attitude when i speak even if im just saying no to something they make me pay for my cloths i make money by mowing the lawn and threaten to take away payment if i dont comply also they say that im spoiled and should be greatful for what i have and i am greatful but they dont seem to get it my sister recently broke her ipad and instead of making her repair with her own money which she can afford they buy her a brand new one also they bought her a new chromebook for no reason and she didnt even need one for school or home reasons i know if that happened to my phone they would laugh and make me pay for it my parents also act very kind and friendly to guests but when they leave theyre back to normal but on the other hand they have given me a phone and taken the family on trips so im no sure if im being abused or im just overreacting and sensitive,Positive
im a year old female in college and im back home for the summer i have always felt that my mom has always been controlling and emotionally abusive growing up my parents supported me through my first year of college out of state i didnt get into the university in state that they wanted me to go and i transferred back in state for my upcoming sophomore year throughout my first year of college every time my mom called me she would remind me about how expensive the out of state tuition is and that i needed to transfer back in state for my sophomore year no matter what she also threatened me that if i didnt she would force me to break up with my boyfriend and that i would have to pay for the tuition by myself fyi my mom was the one that made the decision for me to go to that out of state school because she thought that if i couldnt transfer back to the in state school that she liked at least that university is better than the community college or other in state schools that i got into throughout the entire year i was very stressed and anxious because of her constant calls to complain about her expenses and threats as many asian parents do she constantly compares me to other kids she knows and recently since im back home for the summer it has been about me not being independent enough one example she gave was how her friends daughter found her college apartment herself and how she works so she barely has to ask her parents for any allowances but when i wanted to go tour apartments with my boyfriend she demanded that we brought her along because she thinks we dont have enough experience to make a good decision as i mentioned before she doesnt like my boyfriend because he wasnt very focused on his studies in high school and he didnt get into a good university in her opinion at the start of our relationship she constantly said that he wasnt good enough for me we have been together for almost a year now doing long distance and she has been waiting for the relationship to die out since about a few months ago she has transitioned to saying that he will most probably dump me when were doing long distance and she said that shes saying that to prepare me mentally she also said that she is okay with me dating him but not is i marry him and that i want to marry him she will kick me out of the house and not support me she has also introduced me to a family friends son and jokingly said that i should date him instead because his family is wealthy my dad has always enabled her behaviour and just told me to accept who she is and ignore her and not get mad i know he just doesnt want to start a fight with her but i dont understand how he can always watch me always get hurt by her and not do anything about it i know she loves me and that she wants the best for me but i have always felt hurt and angry towards how she raised me and how she is continuing to control and dictate my life im scared to have children in the future in fear that i will turn out to be like her sometimes i tell myself that asian parents just parent like this and i should just accept it and move on but i have also never seen my friends or other asian parents as extreme as my mom i honestly dont know what to do and i dont even know if this is considered as emotional abuse or just asian culture parenting i have recently thought about moving out and cutting her off i just really wish she didnt always want to make decisions for me that will impact me for the rest of my life at this point im just ranting to make myself feel better feel free to leave any opinions or advice as im feeling very lost rn,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi there reddit im not accustomed to this website though i could spend hours scrolling through texttospeech stories id never thought id be here to write out a story but here i am id like to get some advice as im stuck between two possibilities for my future all advice is wanted without further ado heres the story itll be a long one i f have lived with my mom fs and dad ms for my entire life my childhood up until about is a blur to me but ever since then ive been dealing with a lot of conflicts most of these issues come from my mom its hard to describe her in a word but i feel as if emotionally abusive would be one i hear tossed around when shes mentioned in a short summary will expand on later she mocks me for my interests weight and general likeness she puts me down a lot is extremely manipulative and has her thumb over me even now at im going to be turning soon which is important to this story ive had a lot of conflict coming to terms with if im the asshole or not i cannot say im a perfect child as ive had a track record of lying to her about being on the internet lying has become second nature with her since i was ive been infatuated with the people i meet online they provide me a lot of comfort in friendship that i cant find in real life i find people with common interests share my art and overall enjoy speaking with them ive been fairly careful though reckless as well my mom however believes everybody on the internet is out to kill me partly that may be true but after a certain point you can trust certain individuals she has been known to go through my messages search history google drive etc etc etc she has been very watchful of me but apparently not enough as ive been avoiding being caught for a year or so now either or she is protective of me to the point it is suffocating this is one piece of many things that build up to my current situation another large piece is her tendencies to put me down as well through my studies through my entirety of school ive been a straight a student with exception of a few bs i have a very poor motivation factor which leads me to be lazy frankly and i skate by a lot by doing things last minute she puts me down for my grades however even if its an a she and my dad ill dive into him later believe i dont do enough with my life despite having a job for about days a week and juggling classes i just finished a few online college classes and even then they both seemed apprehensive to tell me id done well for getting as it baffles me how they seem proud over other kids achievements when they have rarely ever expressed their appreciation to my work i find myself compared to other kids around me a lot because they are in sports and cheerleading and yada yada yada ive played a sport my mom played when she was growing up until i opted to focus on my job least to say she also wasnt pleased about that she made it all about competition and the fun was taken away when shed yell at me from across the fence to try harder on the topic my self esteem is crushed because of her i am an overweight girl and i can admit it i am not proud of who i am let alone can i love myself because of her comments to me on a daytoday basis shell make snide remarks about how that shirt doesnt look flattering or oh so you cant wear these pants anymore because you put on weight youll have to go up another size i cant say im morbidly obese but im not super thin either ive been told by people i look nice but all hopes of believing it has vanished with her making fun of me at the dinner table she has placed the blame of me not being able to make friends on not taking care of myself i can recall an instance where i had a breakdown at school about how i felt alone i get home ask if we can talk and she starts lecturing me on how if i tried harder and conformed to other peoples likes id be well liked i started zoning out and she got upset saying i couldnt take the criticism and was just like my grandma i get compared to her mom a lot she had a hard childhood growing up with an emotionally absent mom who also commented on her weight she didnt have it easy but surely it isnt an excuse for her behavior i cannot say ive had a rough childhood through possessions during my life ive been given a lot of nice things i can admit im spoiled even now and i have a lot that most dont we arent rich but we are well off with my dads job theyve done a lot of nice things for me as paying for my cars insurance so i only worry about gas about half the time ive been paying for my own luxuries since last september when i started my job but that doesnt mean i dont buy them dinner a lot ive become the busboy to pick up their dinner sometimes on my own accord ive been told by my mom i can come to her with my issues i come to her with my problems and she beats me down for them ive learned to avoid her with my personal issues and she becomes upset with me for being distant there was a time my grandma moms mom outed me to my mother saying that i wasnt sure if i liked girls my mom sat in the restaurant we went to and sobbed holding my dads hand and calling me a disgrace to the family i remember at years old she told me shed kick me out if she found out i was gay we got home after a silent ride home and told me to get out i began to walk to the nearest town as i live in the country before my dad came and picked me up id had to throw my exfriends long story under the bus and say they influenced me for her to get off my case she isnt a churchgoer but adheres to christian values ive tried to run away many times before but ive never gotten farther than a few minutes away she makes me feel very guilty about my now dead grandma dads side by using her as a figment to make me feel bad about my actions if i do something she deems irresponsible or bad she will tell me that shes looking down at you disappointed or she never wouldve liked that my mom forgets to mention how she also neglected my grandmother in her dying years and cries about how she misses her when she never helped her my dads mom was my biggest supporter for awhile and losing her took a toll on me my mom using her dead presence as a threat gets on my nerves now the biggest piece of this apprehension toward her comes from yesterday wed gotten into an argument when id snapped at her under stress of finishing a college class she told me id be getting my car taken away and stormed off i went to get ready for work and as im walking to the bathroom she begins to rant she talks about how i walk all over her and that i treat her like the dirt on the bottom of my shoe she mentions how i only care about myself which i believe im caring to others and my dearest cat and then drops a bombshell ill be paraphrasing as i cant remember the exact words my love for you is unconditional but theres a breaking point it turns into resentment and then hatred i raised my eyebrows for the longest time her scoldings and verbal beatings made me numb id stand there listen and have it go in and out of my head her arguments were always the same about how i was an ungrateful brat who never did anything for them but this was different she responded yeah i hate you some days my mom admitted to hating me never ever had she done this the lowest she would get is refusing to say she loved me after this i began to cry silently as she told me at if i didnt have my shit together id be kicked out with nothing to my name in my mind id already checked out i knew i couldnt do this anymore id called many close people to me before crying about her and too many times shed act like nothing happened she has broken me down so much that i feel worthless just as she describes ive done to her ive contemplated things because of her words because of her apprehension to me she has no friends and always told me im all she has aside from my dad she has told me she wouldnt live on without me i hate her i hate my mom a lot she has ruined my trust issues and my overall wellbeing over the span of years now enter two people who have changed my perception dakota f and rose fs have changed my life a lot in many positive ways dakota is my best friend and i spend a lot of time with her and her mom rose weve gone out together and done things as a group especially after a trip to another country we went on earlier in the year rose is one of the sweetest ladies ive met and while her english is a little hard to understand she has a massive heart she has treated me better than any adult in my life has up to this point and since that trip she has been a big support for me dakota and i go to the same school though we live in towns about minutes away and are also very close she knows about every detail of my family and has always been there for me for about two years or so after the episode with my mom the day prior id called dakota to report whatd happened weve talked before about me moving in to her house though it never seemed like a possibility last night we talked about the chance and how it seemed plausible given a few sacrifices on my end it gave me a spark of hope but nothing concrete however today was like a beam of light i was at work again during a hour shift when rose and dakota show up to my workplace with two bags of food from a party theyd went to yesterday i nearly burst out crying when rose had mentioned there was tres leches my favorite dessert in the bag she told me she loved me and missed me wanting me to talk to her more we plan to call tomorrow after this an hour later i called dakota while working in the lobby cleaning up this is when a bombshell was dropped that her dad would be okay with me moving in i had to ask her if she was serious and she was plus id be able to bring my cat if i wanted to since i worry for his wellbeing in my current house i wanted to sob because the love theyve shown me is incredible and its made me rethink what real love feels like rose tells me frequently that she loves me and is proud of me and how she doesnt understand my mom i was also informed by dakota that i am referred to as her daughter by rose additionally my mom seems to be jealous of her shell get eerily quiet whenever i talk about her and my dad says that she only likes me because she has no expectations of me it makes me uncomfortable when they downplay the people in my life if they arent them nor their friends this is where i feel guilty after the life my parents have given me with all of my belongings and a secure roof over my head and food i want to abandon them for dakotas family i cannot determine if my mom is truly abusive or if im the problem and ive never been able to figure out an exact answer to that ive never been able to go to therapy as my mom said i never had real problems to stress about and that i needed a psychiatrist instead to figure me out i cant tell if im to blame for some of the things that have happened as ive been resistant to her for a few years now blame it on being a teenager but im almost an adult should i still be hesitant with her in short i have a chance to leave this life behind and move in with dakota for awhile ive felt at home in their house while i feel like a stranger and cleaner in my own im worried about college as i dont have the funds for it myself and i wouldnt have a car plus i also worry about my mom seeking me out with malice intent i need advice as im at a standstill for what to do so reddit please tell me am i in the right for wanting to leave my manipulative mom after years of her torment to live with my best friends family instead add should also preface by saying that i have been struggling with undiagnosed issues for years yet my mom only wants to call me depressed and stresses the importance of a psychiatrist versus a therapist id asked about getting a counselor and she never followed through finding one i need help but i can never receive it adequately hence why dakota knows so much about her behavior bless her heart for always listening to me ramble add my mom also has a hard time connecting with her side of her family she gets uncomfortable and angry with them a lot yet they havent wronged her except her own mother id called my aunt one day to tell her about something my mom had done which was threaten to make me pay rent and she never realized how bad she was my mom has virtually nobody i cant help but feel guilty for likely pushing my aunt away from her though it gives me a peace if mind to know my aunt would always love me and care for me if my mom didnt,Positive
while mom is out of state visiting her boyfriend the mother says its ok because the oldest is although he is rarely home because he goes to school then works so the year old is basically home alone most of the time mom rarely answers her calls and texts when her kids try to get ahold of her when she is out of state with her boyfriend,Neutral

i am m as a kid we were sometimes hit and threatened not the normal stuff parents say like threatening to take something away or the normal creative threats that black parents say i am black and for whatever reason in our culture borderline abuse is normalized i got threats yelled at me like i will break your legs if you move again and sometimes they acted on some of these threats and sometimes my parent would tell me how we are very similar people we are both charming and we both are good at taking advantage of others for our personal gain this stuff has served to make me a liar and a manipulator with a messed up imagination i have been lying and manipulating since i was young and have a very bad habit of it i have gotten very good at it and it is like second nature to me i lied for stuff as simple as food im not looking for pity i already know that i am not a great human being but i am quite honestly afraid of myself i hate myself for what i am so much i want to change i am trying to change sometimes it hurts and the guilt weighs heavy on me at times interacting with other people is extremely difficult too because i am physically incapable of some of the emotions they express and being attached to them because i dont seem to need that connection as much as they do but i still crave it it is complicated for me i come across as cold and i really dont want to be this way anymore i dont want to hurt people i really hope my parent dont find this i have parental controls on my phone,Positive

so my dad has been kind of aggressive his whole life hes been a good dad for most parts but when he got mad i was just scared of him its been like this as long as i can remember i dont have a lot of childhood memories abt his and mine relationship together but the ones i do have are bad so bad i often have nightmares abt them my best friend knows but no one else does i dont know if i would be able to call my dad abusive as he can be a really good dad its just when hes mad that he gets physically aggressive he has never straight up punched or beaten me but he has pulled my hood of my hoodie making me choke and done things like grab me really tight and shake me around he also has lashed out on me on multiple occasions and then he grabs my arms and forces them in a wrong position or he just lays his hands on me in a painful way but not in a way i would call punching me the problem is that hes never straight up slapped or punched me but he has hurt me and he has made me afraid of him and his temper i often stand up against him when hes mad at my sister making him hurt me so he wouldnt touch my sister its been like this as long as i can imagine and i dont know what to call it i dont want to call it abuse bc i know other people have it way way worse than me and hes never actually straight up punched or slapped me but my friend does say its not normal to be this scared of my father when he gets angry does anyone know if this could be a type of abuse or would it just be called normal as he is my parent and kind of like my boss also i might add that bc of his temper and the things he has done to me my love for him has definitely lessened and i dont know how to feel abt this as i cant do anything abt it and i know i actually cant feel this way bc people who actually have an abusive father are still able to see the good in him and i cant and i think thats my own fault,Positive
i dont remember much of my childhood because of childhood trauma i dont bring it up anymore or try to get help because every time cps comes my parents and sister act like nothing ever happened and whenever i bring up my grandmas abuse she says it never happened too and everyone else says that too i havehad bruises all over my body as well as being lbs at because my mom constantly body shames me and says that she will put me on a diet and that she doesnt was a fat kid mind you my bmi was twelve point five my parents dont allow me to go to the doctors so i had to get better on my own ive gained alot of weight but my mental state has gotten worse my dad step he hits me takes my favourite things away for at least six months just for crying as he tells me how he wishes i was never born he wants a better son im an asshole and that hes gonna kill me my parents also lock me out of the house or in the cold dark basement for hours no matter what season my cousins touch me and still no one believes me is there something wrong with me do i deserve all of this i dont think i can take this anymore i need help but im scared my only safe place is the hospital or with my friends because they truly care,Neutral
i stopped fighting i was going through a dark period and i was on the verge of ending it all and i just gave up i stopped yelling back i stopped fighting the blatant abuse and comments i just became a shell of myself i thought that once i became a target they would push me to the point of getting the courage to finally leave earth for good than something really weird happened they got super angry and more flustered and frustrated then ive ever been able to get them to be or have seen them they are constantly throwing things my way and the minute i shut down its like they literally cant comprehend for once that im not fighting back ive become a literal human posseum of just shuting off and playing dead now i feel strongly so much better then i have in a long time it feels like i actually can laugh at stuff and i can exist without feeling totally useless anymore i know this is probably a super unhealthy way to deal with this but i just wanted to share and see if anyone else has had this happen and if so how did it end up for you,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i have been been a gentle kid from my childhood i dont like anyone being rude me nor i like to be rude to anyone i have always done the best i could in studies in the relationship with my father and my mother they were always with me no matter what i do and however i performed after th grade though my mother had stopped doing such things altogether she would just correct me when i am wrong and is still to day as my friend she is very support and understanding while my father since that time has been more and more abusive and ranting i know i didnt cleared the hostel school exams i didnt want to i didnt knew anything about them nor did i really wanted to go anywhere even though all of this i still did my best and according to most people thats what matters right not to him every time if i only score then that is earned by me i am happy with it i dont want anything more and anything less than i work for i dont want to meet any unrealistic expectations that he has any day when he sees me watching my phone even though my youtube screen time is less than hour nor do i go play outside nor do i watch sports or movies on the tv anything i do exept studying triggers him if i draw and sketch to relieve my stree he still interrupts and scolds me with cuss words at every result he has the same sentence to say to my teachers even though all of them says i good at studying hes just on his phone all day and doesnt study like ok if that was the case who tf watches youtube all day and still is a high performer man each day i am feeling mentally exhausted yesterday i was crying on my table because of it everything hurts i dont want to even live in this family its just that my mother is so caring i cant imagine her when she hears that i have hung myself or something she is the only motivation i have please suggest me anything you may,Positive
f since i was little my moms displayed emotionally and physically abusive behaviour however she alot of the time genuinely acts like a caring mom she will feed me hug me kiss me try comfort me and now i just reject it all i rebel as much as i can i dont do what she asks i just feel angry around her but then i feel copious guilt whenever i do shes pregnant right now and that makes me feel worse for being mad at her she hasnt taught me to do many chores and im struggling with my health so all ive been doing is sitting on my pc all day like always she does everything but then she screams that i dont do anything even though i genuinely dont know when and how to do some of the stuff she always tells me when to shower and how disgusting i am but she didnt teach me proper hygeine either and its genuinely hard to catch on i can wash dishes and clean my room sure but thats all she complains that she does everything and i press her to rest sometimes and even now i get mad when she lies to me like example when i was really little i listened to her and stayed silent when she screamed i cried of course but i stayed silent when she was hitting or arguing with me or my other family but now im rebelling and trying to make her feel what i do but why do i feel so much guilt especially because as soon as she asks me to do something or comes in my room i want her to leave and tell her to get out or scream at her she comes in telling me i still have tuition this week even though she told me i wouldnt during summer it just triggered me so much and i kept telling her to get out and stop lying to me all the time i want to behave because i feel like a horrible daughter and i still love her and feel guilt i dont like going out with her or her coming into my room to tell me to get off my pc or clean my room i always tell her to get out and rebel i feel like the abuse isnt abuse and its my fault she acts the way she does soemtimes i feel like a spoiled ignorant brat i hate myself she told me she was pregnant and were moving house outside london and moving schools i cant deal with all of this shes so horrible yet so kind i feel like im mocking abuse because theres people who have it worst she actts like a normal mom mostly and alot of the time its my reactions that start fights or arguments when we argue i argue back and scream she hits and screams too its all my fault,Positive

ive been dealing with an abusive mom my whole life she and my dad divorced after years of her cheating they were married for one year before she started for context and has been taking it out on me since its a long story but to put things into perspective she didnt give the relationship a chance my dad worked three jobs to support us as i was born with a birth defect and medical bills were costly before they finally gave me insurance because it would never be fixed according to her this was too muchthey never got intimate and i guess she really couldnt wait since i can remember ive met countless men and have been forced to stay with them while she does whatever she wants i lied to my dad my whole childhood and he definitely took it out on me id get in trouble at school bad grades because of the birth defect which ended up leaving me mostly blind and hed jump on my ass and beat me to the ground living with his isnt an option every time i ask his wife and her kids tell him no i have nowhere to go im now heading off to university soon to finish my last two years as a transfer i cant keep doing this i feel bad sometimes like really really bad to hate her so much but just today she offered to get me a few groceries because she didnt get me anything the last time she went instead she bought a bunch of meat for the guy shes seeing and it sits there because he doesnt come over in the span of a few hours i took a nap and she came home and i didnt respond right away shes been ignoring me since she does this all the time i try really hard to let it go and ignore her i hear its called gray walling or something like letting a person whos narcissistic just talk to themselves so they feel better but its hard because i dont have anywhere to go until school and she threatens me constantly to kick me out im disabled my vision wont ever get better and i truly feel that she uses it to her advantage i cant say or do anything she doesnt like im afraid that the money i just spent to order the groceries she told me to get is going to be wasted i had to doordash for dinner and ive been spending money for school so i wont have anything let to be able to survive on the i had was from a program for school and she only let me participate so she wouldnt have to spend money on me she may not go pick them up and my dad is pretty absent i get a call and visit every now and then after he got remarried and the wife has younger kids im mostly fine ive hardened because of it all but i just feel like i blow things out of proportion sometimes crying over it feels so soft when i know that nothing will change i cant help but have hope even though i know better she got me like worth of stuff for graduation this past spring and shes pretty much bought everything for college for my dorm but then she does small stuff like tonight and other times and i feel fucking dumb i tell myself to not talk to her unless i absolutely have to and then the very next day im trying to show her something funny i found i feel like its majorly just yknow wanting a mom especially cause i have to live with her but i know better it fucking sucks theyre going on vacation thats the only reason i could get the groceries she doesnt even care to invite me the last vacation we had was a school orientation that we had to travel for i feel so resented a man who disrespects her constantly has more respect than me she constantly talks on the phone at max volume reminding everyone how excited she is for me to leave we live on the third floor of our apartment building and every time we go shopping she reminds me of how excited she is to not have to buy groceries and carry them up the stairs anymore there was a first floor available but god forbid anyone make any noise shes a classic karen too we got food yesterday and the worker asked the typical question of do you want to round for xyz and she felt it was necessary to yell at the girl for it its not just to me but i definitely think i get the worst of it the guys she gets with get it bad too i dont understand how a meal and vacations are enough to make them stay because i know they dont love her it feels like everything she does is her fault and i cant tell her that shes mad about the dishes but wont ever get the guy to wash them after cooking him a fivestar meal i leave one bowl washed and just sitting there because i forgot to put it away and she screams at me when i try to justify what i did working is the absolute worst thing to her she has a good job and quits because it requires a little bit of labor i fear well end of homeless sometimes with how hard she tries to avoid bills and taxes we dont need food stamps or food banks but she applies to everything we arent poor at all i honestly fear for my life sometimes shell tell me shell choke me if she sees something happen again i know theyre mostly empty threats but it worries me a lot im worried that school wont even be an escape enough from her i want to change my number after i graduate and just disappear she never put hands on me other than smothering me and hitting me a few times and i think thats why im so hesitant to feel like a victim cause

i grew up in a household that valued chores above everything else my chores were to wash the dishes starting at th grade and to help out with weekly deep clean of the house my father was always angry at us me and my younger brother for not doing the chores on time so as time went on he started to give us more chores as punishment for not doing the chores we already had to do by th grade my father got tired of me not washing the dishes on time so cooking dinner for the family also became my chore with the saturday cleaning he got tired of us constantly fighting over who does what so that also became me and my brothers chore he was a stay at home dad but most if not all chores were done by me and my siblings we never got allowances for doing them it was either you complete them by the time limit or you dont get to live in the house consequences for not doing chores were being locked out of the house sometimes over night sitting on our knees for extended amount of time spanking with or without objects and other corporal punishments my parents made it very clear that if the chores werent done on time i would be facing the consequences even then i would not obey by their rules i would get very upset at the thought of having to do them and would avoid doing the chore until i got in trouble after a certain point i never understood even as a child why i felt so strongly against doing the chores now as an adult who lives alone i enjoy doing chores since i live alone there is no time limit for when i have to complete them by and to be honest i do struggle to do them at times but they still get done at some point how do other parents teach kids to do chores bc the way my parents did it obviously doesnt work,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my dad was an absolute monster towards me and my family growing up and till my mom divorced him we left the day he kicked us out and once he left the house we came back to change locks and found a whole potential murder scene waiting for us if we decided to come back when he was begging my mom to come home its been since since then and last time i saw him was in court when my little brother passed away and my dad was trying to get rights over what to do with his remains even though he hadnt seen my brother once when he was alive after my parents split or even talked to him i see now that hes just living his life he looks happy he has a new girlfriend and it just eats away at my soul to know that he can just live a normal life knowing what he did to me and my siblings even my mom so sometimes i just cant help myself but comment on pics of him and his new girlfriend and just say the absolute horrible shit hes done and the hell hes caused i just dont ever want him to be happy especially since she has kids its like he starting over with a brand new family it just honestly kills me,Positive
im years old and i live with my mom its just us two as my parents divorced when i was a kid and my brother moved out my dad lives in a different city and so does my brother so i dont see them much my mom has always been verbally abusive she used to get physical but when i was about she stopped since then she has hit me a couple of times but i always forgave her the thing is she is very manipulative and she is always yelling and insulting me i have learned to ignore her over the years but sometimes i explode and yell back another thing is that she shields her abuse behind the fact that she is just asking me to clean up but what bothers me is not the cleaning part but how she insults me and manipulates me while i do it today i had my first day of a job and she wouldnt let me go because she wanted me to clean somethings around the house while i was cleaning she kept shouting at me and hit me in the back twice i exploded then and yelled at her to get out of my house its my dads house and told her to never put a hand on me again i tried to leave but she backed me into a corner and hit me in the mouth she didnt hit me very hard but hard enough to leave a scratch on my face then i snapped and slapped her in the face i feel very bad about it and cant stop crying after that i just ran out of the house and left in my car my mom bought that car for me and she told me that she wants it back i really need that car and without it i cant go to school or work i dont know what to do about the situation any suggestions or advice is appreciated,Neutral
tw child abuse description of an act of violence against a teenager im in my s now and i have for the most part moved past and have gotten over the majority of the abuse i received from my stepfather when i was a teenager for reasons that im not going to get into me becoming a teenager and going through puberty caused a huge shift in my stepfathers behavior this man started to absolutely hate me and i can honestly say for the most part i was not a bad kid and i did not deserve the things he did to me one day when i was my mom was in the hospital she has congestive heart failure as well a congenital birth defect in her heart and shes been hospitalized more times than i can count i absolutely hated the times she wasnt there because there was no one to intervene on my behalf when my stepfather would undoubtedly get pissed at me for whatever i did or didnt do that day this particular day i was cleaning my room and i decided to rearrange my bedroom furniture while i was at it well that was a terrible idea because i got my ass handed to me for not asking his permission to rearrange my furniture which turned into this circular argument of him asking me why i didnt ask his permission and me saying that i didnt think i had to and he would just keep asking me the same thing and getting angrier and angrier every time he asked me and after like the dozenth time of being asked why i didnt ask his permission i got angry and yelled i didnt fucking think i had to well that was the wrong damn thing to do because he then grabbed me by the throat slammed me up against the back door and started choking me im not embarrassed to admit that i actually pissed myself because i could not breathe and i was absolutely terrified which brings me to the statistic i mentioned in the title apparently if you are strangled by someone there is a increased risk of that person killing you within a year thats absolutely terrifying and honestly i can see that there was indeed a high chance that that could have happened because he had a shotgun in the closet upstairs and when he was on a yelling tirade one of the things he used to say constantly was how one of these days im gonna snap and i promise you when i do im gonna get that gun and im taking everybody out with me he absolutely would have fit the profile of the family annihilator that was the last time he put his hands on me and thats only because i packed a suitcase and ran away became an emancipated minor one last story about him when i was my mom asked me to come over for christmas just to stay for like an hour to open presents so he called the cops on me tried to get me arrested for trespassing cops made him feel like shit because of the absolute assholery of this and because my mom also owns the house and she invited me so there was no trespassing even happening so thanks if you read this whole novel if youre a victim of a parent strangling you please please remember the statistic and get out as soon as possible your life is legitimately in danger,Neutral

ill try to keep this story nice and short but to start off my early childhood was not the best me and my brother were raised in a single mother household probably because of how horrible our mom was and my half brother spared all the trauma by luckily living at his dads but we were beat for the pettiest things at home like getting one question wrong on our homework and wed be punished severely like dipping our fingers in boiling hot water or throwing us across the room and kicking our stomachs repeatedly this in itself was bad enough but i dont wanna get into all of it as we grew into early adolescence the physical abuse lessened and we got the opportunity to move in with our firststepdad i believe he was kind of nice although that wouldnt stop my mother from controlling primarily me at that point and turning me against him as she alienated me from him something ive come to see quite a bit lmao and getting her own house again there was still a lot of unsolved trauma though between me and my little brother overall in the entire family we didnt have the best relationship even to this day because our mother pitted us against each other numerous times things were quiet for some reason during this period none of us talked to each other just very disconnected but i partially managed to fix things with my brothers again now in my middle adolescence things are heating up again with yet another one of her boyfriends whos obviously immature and incapable but the thing is every man she dates gets worse literally a month ago her boyfriend flashed my little brother and moved out his house after we just moved in now letting him stay at our house wtf but its like shes finding the perfect deranged mother fucker to collide with and torment her own children i cant recall much from my past but can remember things years ago from school because at home chaos brews hell fire with the doors locked from the public eye my mother has taken away all of my things before but ive been playing it safe now,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom was very abusive towards me in childhood and i used to wish every day that she would love me and that id stop messing up she would scream and get mad at me for what i used to think were my fault but were actually things that didnt really matter like me spilling rice not liking her recent instagram posts quickly enough forgetting something inside the house and having to walk back in to get it they would be really angry outbursts and i wondered why all my friends got to have relationships with their moms while i always had to walk on eggshells at home my dad wasnt home a lot because of work he was usually nice when he was home in childhood and he never knew about my moms actions towards me the day after i moved to college my mom became super nice she buys me things and is levelheaded its like shes a completely different person shes the mom i prayed for every night as a kid but shes too late the night before college she got really mad at me and said i drove her crazy and her eyes darkened and she got mad at me like she always has its like a complete switch i know shes nice now and shes been nice for a year but i hate her i cant talk and i shut down in front of her so even if im talking with my dad if shes in the room i talk very curtly which i try to fix but honestly i dont feel comfortable expressing myself in front of her its ruining my relationship w my dad we have our own issues he is honestly kind of an asshole sometimes but i still love him but we still have some tensions sometimes bc hes so stubborn and he also hates when i get emotional but i dont hate him for it honestly im just confused i dont understand why i had to go through that and its hard to confront the fact that the abuse didnt make me more unique or special or teach me lessons it just happened and now its hard for me to live happily or express myself meanwhile many of my friends have learned to be confident and are growing into well rounded and amazing young adults coming from loving households no one i know understands this situation or having abusive parents my dad had an abusive dad and now he is married to an abusive mom unknowingly its just a lot for me to process i am not close to either parent because of the effect the abuse had on my interactions with everyone in my life what can i do how can i move forward how can i have a relationship with my parents even though i honestly dont want one,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i m still live at home with mom and her bf while i pursue my nd associates degree my parents got divorced when i was overall growing up was not ideal my father was physically and verbally abusive as well as an alcoholic and my mom not much better just more verbally abusive although she has laid hands on me and my youngest sister a couple times my older sisters and my grandparents practically raised me throughout the years my parents got divorced because they both cheated on each other the man my mom is with is the man she cheated on my dad with so theres some resentment there to begin with i currently am little to no contact with my dad due to actions postdivorce that i simply cannot forgive during the custody talks i basically was met with a decision of choosing the lesser of two evils when it came to who i wanted to live with so i ultimately chose my mother during the divorce my mom paid no mind to me she cared more about getting child support out of my dad as well as appeasing her new boyfriend she posted about it publicly on facebook and garnered sympathy the only person that ever checked on me was my oldest sister i admittedly still am not over the divorce because i feel as though i never got any form of closure from that point to now my mom has been one of the most shallow people ive ever known in my life even more than when she was with my dad she makes me feel like a burden to her as well defending her bfs questionable actions i believe him to be a carbon copy of my dad my mom has defended him when he was made downright awful statements sexual in nature toward my sisters as well as girls that i brought over in the years ive known him i recall a time my mom telling me i wish i met bf earlier on that way i couldve divorced your dad and you wouldve been a better student and a better athlete in high school i hear that in my head every night when i lay down on top of that my mom has this obsession with being skinny so she makes comments about my weight even though i have been told my body is perfectly normal by my doctor and others around me this got to the point it hurt me so much that ive started wearing shirts that are sizes bigger she says awful comments to me over petty things for example there was a sweatshirt on my floor this morning because i took it off after i got hot in my sleep and she tells me why cant you keep your room clean you cant seem to do anything right or if i leave a plate in the sink she tells me how much of a slob i am if something is not done to her specifications or the way she wants it i dont stop hearing about it until the end of the day i get told that im useless that ill never be able to live on my own or that no girl will ever wanna marry me today i reached a breaking point and left to go to my oldest sisters house my mother called me shortly after i arrived and continued to berate me over the phone telling me i dont do anything around the house and that im useless and that im just like my father maybe im not making it sound as bad as it is im a terrible storyteller but these last years with my mom have been nothing but a stain on my mental health i cant tell her how i feel because she tries to turn it around on me and make me feel bad ive always struggled with depression since i was a child and ive just kind of learned to live with it however as of recent the thought has been swirling around to just take my own life i firmly believe that i am not good enough for anyone or anything in this world that if i am not worthy of a mothers love am i worthy of any love at all its been years of build up and i just dont know what to do ive tried counseling and medication none of it helps im not financially stable enough to move out and neither of my sisters nor my grandparents have the room to take me in im making this post as a last ditch effort to seek advice or even words of encouragement thank you to all for taking the time out of your day to read this,Positive

sorry that this is long its complicated every time i share any part of my situation with my mother no one understands what im going through so im just gonna try to keep it short lots of my siblings agree that my mother is abusive and so does my father idk what started this whole issue but someday the peace that once existed within my family was absolutely destroyed leaving me with a life where my mother tries to take over the family with legal power and abusing the power of being a guardian ps she identifies as a christian and has strictly believed many things in the bible since divorce processes take a while especially when youre trying to manage a family business your wife wont put the effort into assisting in the way you have been in the past decade she has a lot of power against what belongs to who involving the kids the reason why i know so much about all this is because my mom starts drama about almost anything in front of us whether its about the kids or about the marriage im lucky that no one in my family thinks what shes doing is fair but she uses her legal right to control the family and my younger siblings struggle with deciding which parent to obey especially when they are afraid of what the mother will do if they disobey her unreasonable demands im more defiant thankfully shes out of the house most of the time because of everything thats going on ps she plays the victim a lot by using facts yet morphing them into points that dont make sense for the disagreement if that makes sense if she doesnt use facts shell just make her feelings the priority even when what should be the priority is logicthe point of the problem im living in hell when my dad isnt there to make things right though so ive tried my hardest to keep as much distance as i can when i need to things got wild the night that im writing this bc my mom has reattempted to take things related to the family and the love that once existed between my parents me and my siblings were there waiting for her to leave to the place she said shed go to the first thing she tried to take was a gift that she made for my father and her reasoning of why she should be able to take it was i made it myself and now i want it back my family agreed that thats not how it works but of course my parents arent officially divorced so she has legal ownership but it was morally wrong in short things got rough and my mother didnt seem to care about what we were feeling and she wouldnt stop physically trying to take a gift from my fathers hands when she cooperated she made it seem like she was forced to instead of her agreeing to bc it was the right thing to do it was a hurtful experience that i wish could be deeply understood without sharing too much info but this experience combined with many others has left me with the aching wish of her not living also because once the divorce process is done and things calm down she still lives life easy by relying on the money my father has earned by handling the business which is undeserved knowing what my father has had to go through these past months graphic ive imagined many things around the house in my hands as a tool to mash the side of my mothers head ive never remembered my mother suffering through any kind of injury so the thought of her suffering a lethal one after years of living an easy life was a comforting dream for me this is my first time sharing something like this at this degree and having it be so public but im doing this bc i have no one to talk to and i feel like no one understands believes or cares about what im going through other than my father sorry for making this long i needed to add context to the complexity of her ridiculous logic idk how views and impressions work on social media but if you read all of this and actually care abt what im saying tysm please respond and tell me if you think what im saying is stupid or if it makes sense and ig share your thoughts on it but yeah,Positive

is there some physiological reason my mom cries after screaming and hitting me and my siblings my mother is physically mentally and emotionally abusive she gets very mad very easily and tries to blame me and my siblings for everything that ever goes wrong or went wrong in her life its not like the physical abuse is happening is very day sometimes she lasts a whole month without hitting us but this physical abuse started happening when i was and and i am now about to turn my two sisters are and and even they cant escape from our mothers abuse even tho the physical abuse doesnt happen everyday there is not a day where my mother doesnt scream at us we just got out of a fight that included her yelling at us and attacking us for no reason even tho she swears its our fault and she started crying and now she locked herself in her room and is probably crying she has no reason to cry shes the one who is abusive so why is she crying why does my mother cry after shes done hitting us there was to be some physiological explanation for this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i just dont know how to cope with the comments that my mother gives me they are mostly negative in relation to my weight and appearance please be kind i grew up with my mother as my main parent for a lot of my childhood my real father was extremely abusive to her and we ran away i was forced to see him every fortnight by the courts and the memories of the things he did still haunts me as soon as i was legally an adult i cut him out of my life my mother herself will admit that she had a narcissist mother who would often be violent show little feelings of love or comfort towards my mother she would often not feed my mother resulting in my mother being emasicated and extremely unwell when my mother describes herself as painfully thin she often smiles about this and acts proud although not diagnosed with an ed she has always been heavily focused on calories and weight as long as i can remember for context she is very thin and is a size uk zero to she still often refers to me as the chunky one in the family comments on my legs being thick and wobbly she mentions often that she would like me to have children so that my belly can become big and saggy like many teenagers that grew up in the late s and early i struggled with my body image i would do anything to be thin i moved out early and still to this day have never received a phone call from her i make all the effort to plan things when we do talk or see one another she doesnt ask me anything about my life show any interest when i try to she will start talking about herself or change the topic entirely when we are in a group and i start talking she talks over me and ended up spending the majority of my s in an unhappy and in a abusive relationship i never felt anything good about myself i thought of myself as nothing my mental and physical health was the worst its ever been i was experiencing many of the side effects of having an ed i confided in my mother about what my ex partner was putting me through she convinced me to stay in that relationship dispute later telling me she hated my ex partner she is never able to offer me any worthwhile advice always blaming the problems in my life on my own actions the police where called by a neighbour after a paticularly violent incident and i was set free years of living in fear pain and violence all gone away the chance of a better life for myself although unaware of it at the time i was still suffering the effects of believing that everything that happened to me was my own fault i spent weeks of having crippling panic attacks eventually i learned to relive again i started secretly chatting and eventually dating to my long term crush i moved into my own bedsit i realised that they are a truly beautiful person they helped repair some of the damage caused we moved together fell in love and got engaged they taught me a passion for life and how to enjoy everything including food my body became healthy i realised what having that feels like i still struggle with body image and dismorphia i have a good support system in place i have been seen by a doctor who put me in a lower end but healthy bmi again just for context i am a uk size and ft she was heavily critical of every decision that i made while planning my wedding and was extremely negative i took my mother wedding dress shopping and she was unable to say anything good i choose the one according to my mother that didnt make me look big or fat she purchased a white wedding dress to wear to my wedding when i mentioned i was hurt by this she went on a tangent saying that i only want her to look horrible she didnt wear the dress due to the support of my family after i explained the suitation they politely explained that the dress just doesnt suit her we got married recently after a year of planning it was everything that i dreamed of i struggled with trying not to starve myself but managed to stay on track knowing that alterations are expensive and my dress fit well the day before the wedding we went out for a big family meal the only topic of conversation from her was about my husband looking nervous and regretting his decision to marry me she keep whispering in my ear things along the lines of he wont turn up the morning of my wedding i tried so hard to ignore the comments that she was making she did her best to job distract the hair and mua to prevent them from being able to focus on me i asked her to help me put on my dress and this i regret deeply she made a big issue of not being able to do it up she spent minutes commenting that i had put on loads of weight despite me being aware that my weight is exactly the same as when i tried it on when i mentioned this she tutted and asked you think so do you unfortunately after comment and negative criticism it did take its toll tried my best to put myself into the headspace of not thinking about my body and more on my beautiful husband when i was fully dressed for my wedding and ready to go i never got any positive comments from my mother she swore and shouted at me in front of all my closest freinds and family just before i was about to walk down the isle seeing my husbands happiness at the end of it made it better when the photographer was around it was hard not to think about how fat i would look in the photos being taken i felt unable to relax dispute the negative impact of my mother i did have a beautiful wedding and an amazing time but i cant look at the photos of myself and feel attractive i understand that a wedding is about marriage and me and my partner have a wonderful relationship where we have open communication i informed the wedding party about her behaviour and they where shocked from now on i believe the best way to live my life is to focus on my marriage i have brought up her behaviour in the past but as you can imagine it hasnt gone down well and its always been my fault i spoke about her behaviour to my stepdad who simply put it down to my mother having verbal diarrhea he explained that she is unaware of her words and the way they make others feel i wouldnt describe my mother as happy in her appearance in fact its quite the opposite i always thought that narcissists belive that the are greatest best and most beautiful amazing people ever however i dont know why else she would behave like this i heard of grey rock syndrome she also has strong emotions and the ability to feel things she appears to lack something however could it be that she is emotionally immature i would like to know so i can understand it better dispute everything i love my mother its difficult and complicated i have come to accept that she cannot listen and doesnt understand the impact of her words,Positive

my mom said that my dad can see my activity such as when im on my phone and what apps im on this has caused me so much anxiety as i have tiktok and reddit which im not supposed to have they havent said anything about that yet im also a teenager doing teenager stuff would prefer if my parents could not see everything on my phone i dont have a great relationship with them and hate them knowing things about me in general a quick google search and i found things like if you phone battery dies quickly or your phone lags or freezes a lot it could mean theres a tracking app installed both of these things seem to apply to my phone and im honestly really scared of them being able to see what im doing and when im on my phone ive looked through my settings and my ipod is under family there which is under my moms email i blocked it after that but didnt find anything else im not techy at all so i have no clue what to look for and where to look ive googled this to no avail i have tried telling her that i dont like being monitored and that its an invasion of privacy but she wont listen please help im sorry if this is the wrong place my parents are emotionally and somewhat physically abusive and i dont know where else to go,Neutral
when i was growing up and especially when i was little i idolized my father i thought he was a great role model and his presence made me happy when i was a teen we would occasionally get into arguments sometimes more severe and sometimes less but i still respected him and enjoyed his company overall these arguments were always verbal never physical except on one memorable occasion when he shoved me i wouldnt say these arguments were out of the ordinary for what i think goes on in most families and my father in many ways was a very good dad when i was growing up he was generous usually pleasant and easygoing he provided me and my brother with everything we ever needed supported us in all our endeavors and i related to him a lot as i felt many of our interests were similar we share the same birthday and he has often expressed to me that i was the best birthday present he ever received over my almost m young adult life my perception of my father has changed drastically as i have recently observed a number of verbally abusive behaviors from him towards me my brother and my mom while is possible that he has always acted this way to some degree and i just didnt notice it as a child i think he has gotten much worse over the years and my brother agrees i dont remember him acting this way when i was a kid when he gets angry he does these things he yells at all of us he curses he is passive aggressive or sometimes very directly aggressive he says things that are mean or derogatory i remember him calling me sensitive in a derogatory way in an argument last year things first got bad about years ago when he had a fight with my mom about a bag of fruit that she threw out not joking he had picked the fruit from the yard himself a couple days prior but the fruit was starting to get old and soft i wouldnt have eaten it at that point when he noticed it in the trash he fished it out tossed it at my mom and called her a b that was the straw that broke the camels back things had been pretty pleasant and normal before then not exactly as things were when i was a kid but similar but after that i was deeply shaken i should note that my mom does yell in arguments too and says some things back at my dad when they are arguing but she is never abusive like that now since then there have been a number of arguments between me and my dad we have talked these through and each time he apologizes but it seems to me like he is always making excuses to go along with the apology or at least thats how i see it he says hes just telling me his own perspective and explaining what happened and why and i usually take those as excuses but i wonder if im judging him too harshly and theyre not really excuses because isnt it fair to give someone your perspective or explain what happened after an argument anyway things have felt a little teetertotter since then ill often have a visit or two where everything is fine hes the same generous loving father i remember there are no arguments hes happy to see me he hugs me calls me buddy we do fun activities together he treats me to lunch etc and i feel like the relationship is healing but then the next visit we get into another argument and i lose a little more respect for him and i feel so awful so fast forward to today my dad and my mom moved this weekend and my brother and i went to help them with the move well last night a couple hours after arriving to their new home we got into another argument the house was very warm when we arrived and we switched on the ac immediately but after several hours as it neared bedtime it was still pretty warm in the bedroom and i was worried that i wasnt going to be able to sleep well so i expressed my concern repeatedly that was probably annoying i was just anxious because i really needed a good nights sleep then i walked around the house trying to make sure the vents were all open etc and found that my dad had left a window open while they were gone despite it being degrees outside and they hadnt closed them since arriving i came out and said maybe it would be cooler if my dad hadnt left the window open honest to goodness i wasnt trying to incite anything i was just annoyed and that is when it happened my dad said f you to me went into his own room and shut the door i didnt see him for the rest of the night i was deeply hurt i take responsibility for my own comment i probably shouldnt havedidnt need to say that but his reaction was so unwarranted for context i am a pretty calm and relaxed person the vast majority of the time this is not just my own perception everyone i know says this about me they consider my calmness one of my defining traits perhaps because of my innate nature or perhaps as a reaction to the very strong personalities in my family i have made a conscious effort in my life to process my emotions in healthy productive ways including my anger i never yell at my friends and especially never at my partner the cycle ends with me unfortunately however i find that i do yell at my parents and my brother i have found it difficult to change with them as they are so explosive aside from those three i find it is easy to maintain my composure and refrain from yelling so this morning he gave me a somewhat weak apology the same deal as many other arguments he said he was sorry and then started trying to explain what happened i said he was making excuses he started yelling at me and i yelled back i yelled at him that cursing his own son out like that was abusive and that i would not accept it he claimed that i was provoking him and doing things to push his buttons i said that was not my intention and all i wanted to hear from him was that what he said was wrong and that he wouldnt do it again after all i probably shouldnt have said what i said but what he said was much worse he said i had to acknowledge that i was pushing his buttons and inciting things and that his feelings were valid too i certainly would have acknowledged that in different circumstances but because of the context i saw that as more excuses and avoiding a real apology so i told him i had nothing left to say now we havent spoken more than a few words in a few hours so reddit i understand that i need to process this on my own terms and the way i see fit maybe i need some therapy but just as a gut reaction what do you all you folks out there think of this what would be an appropriate course of action is this able to be resolved should i apologize to him for pushing his buttons what do you think is the best path forward i dont want to react too extremely i do still love my dad and i dont want him out of my life that being said every time we have one of these arguments it is slowly but surely tarnishing a family relationship that ive known and cherished my whole life thanks in advance for your responses,Positive
hi so recently im a bit confused regarding an incident so to give context its regarding my mother who i believe isnt completely emotionally normal i would not go into the details as i have already in another post so it doesnt matter the thing is that a few months back i remembered an incident of when i was around or i guess my mother getting an episode or something as usual and she went to the kitchen threatening to kill herself idr exactly but i think i went inside ig and then she held my hand and tried doing it to me as well i somehow managed to get out of the situation but i remember she said something while holding my hand like yeah you come along with me as well idr exactly tho also this wasnt the first time she tried harming herself the second or third time ig theonly difference was she tried doing it to me as well this time but i dont get it why after all these years have a randomly out of nowhere recalled such stuff and its kinda bothering me now not alot just a bit also after all these years i feel like i am making all this up and it is in my mind like a bad dream or something idk what it is actually also as a kid i believed all this stuff was normal until i realised maybe not anyways have a good day thank you,Positive
i am years old and it was never easy growing up with my stepfather he abused me and beat me regularly when i was growing up but years ago he sexually assaulted me and tried to rape me several times my mom who worships him didnt leave him over those years i have built up a disgusting amount of anger for the past weeks i have been thinking of killing him every time he tries to hit my brother me or my mom i stop him by pulling out a knife i think its because he beat me up so bad weeks ago that i will never let him get to me again hes dirt and if he ever comes near me again i swear to god also my mother disgusts me because she keeps kissing and sleeping with him sleeps in the same bed even though i will always protect her i will never love her again how do i control this anger and disgust,Neutral

so i have an emotional abusive dad i dont really wanna go into the details but basically my parents had a horrible divorce and i was caught in the middle and somehow this awful man was able to get full custody of me probably through lies and manipulation he always would tell me things as a kid as fact like your mother is an abusive monster you dont really have a mother we are two peas in a pod im always there for you im your support system all of these things i realized was a way to isolate me and control me this dawned on me after my dad having a mood swing he always has mood swings where he makes and excuse that it was ok for him to treat me that way because xyz usually in relation to oh well i was in pain or oh i wasent feeling well or oh i was tired he called me bad dog for staying up late keep in mind im and completely able to do as i please as a legal adult and while yes i shouldnt be staying up late my sleep schedule is not the best because my mental health has been all over the place and im struggling with untreated mental health conditions im working to treat hopefully and if youre asking why is a year old still living with their parent im possibly disabled i say possibly because i havent been able to get diagnosed due to no access to medical care until recently and unemployed due to zero job experience and having physical limitations im hoping to get into collage soon but i just needed a break year for my mental health so back to what i was saying hearing my dad call me bag dog brought me back to all the times when i was a kid where when i did anything he didnt like or if i misbehaved or questioned him he would call me bad dog and how dehumanizing it felt i of course didnt know the words for it as a year old but its just shocking to me that he would do stuff like that and then turn around and be like im your only solid support everyone else is supporting you to but im your number one supporter and then belittle every other support i had that didnt fit his rhetoric i just cant wrap my head around why he would do that i mean i get that he wanted to control me but it just creeps me out and made me realize how controlling and possessive my dad really is over me and im just in a bit of shock and idk what to do i really want to get my own apartment and get the fuck away from him but im unable to do so at the moment and its terrifying im scared of him and now anytime he makes a movement im tense and i prepare myself to deal with his bullshit and ive gotten to the point where i cant take it anymore i just idk what to do or what to think id really appreciate some outside perspectives on this also just so its known this is the very tip of the iceberg with how awful and creepy my dad can be this post could be endless if i tryed to cover it all haha i just wanted that to be known cuz idk how this post may seem from the outside but its been a long time coming in my opinion,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
so my parents were extremely emotionally abusive and ruined my life as a young adult by lying to the entire community about me now im in my s and have gotten injured so much that i am basically completely disabled and i have no where else to turn until i can get disability if that even happens so i may be forced to move back in with them can anyone offer me any motivation or suggestions or anything i am feeling very lost and scared about this step in my life,Neutral
even though im a woman i wish i couldve had a real dad my lack of a real father figure genuinely bothers me i tf am a woman not a man ive been transitioned for a couple years now mtf and no having a weak father is not what made me trans ive had female inclination in my brain structure since i was like in kindergarten and no no one touched me either despite the fact that i am a woman i still spent years being socialized trying my best to be and being perceived as a man i used to look up to my father for his work ethic his honesty and his devotion to my mother i would harrowingly and brutally find out he was actually a liar an adulterer and upon reflection i realized he never really was there for me or my brothers i distinctly remember having to teach myself how to tie a tie before my first job interview using a youtube instructional video everything i learned about fixing cars not that that is an inherently male trait i learned either from my older brother m or from work experience as i used to sell and work with auto parts professionally now the car thing is understandable as i never expressed any interest in working on mechanics or in engineering i was always more into philosophy history art fashion political science nerd stuff like comics and books and cartoons things of that nature which are not gender specific things btw i learned how to fight which toxic as some may think is a genuine important part of being a man unfortunately from again having brothers having friends who studied mma and from dangerous street fights this last one sounds cool but was not i had to go through alot of therapy to undo some damage done to me from having these too young he taught me how to throw a ball i guess and i even was on a baseball team for a season as a kid and we were second in our division otherwise known as the team that lost to the team that would go on to state sports i always had a passive appreciation of and i did enjoy the experience but tbh sports were also not my forte now i have a cellular disease known as mitochondrial disease so i also spent alot of time in and out of a wheelchair as a kid i would get substantially healthier as a teen but i never had any genuine instruction from my father on manhood hell my brother gave me the talk before my dad did one thing i always respected about him though was his morals he would espouse to believe in the fact he worked alot and that when i had my first girlfriend he didnt objectify the concept he said just be sure to treat her like a proper lady and now im gay as a woman i mean transbian is what the term is which was one of the reasons i struggled to realize i was trans but again when push came to shove i realized post transition he wasnt really honest i knew it wouldve been a stretch to get him on board with my transition as hes a devout religious conservative however believe it or not im still a christian myself obviously more progressive in doctrinal understanding but i would end up going to seminary and getting several study certificates i am also now a legally ordained non denominational christian minister and currently study christian topics at yale online gearing up for a big showdown of theology when i first came out i was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find he said well i accept you umm are you a christian still not to be rude are you a full bore woman now asking if i had the surgery or not and i answered accurately not that its anyones business but i have not had any operations no at the time was true and i still believe in jesus yes some remarks here and there would be not fully pc but i would tolerate in patience he invited me to study the bible with him a chance i jumped on as im sure its obvious from my disclosure that im a minister but theology and biblical study are a shared special interest of him and i so i thought he was being genuine and naively let my gaurd down now he did this thing whilst we studied where he would accidently misgender me and or deadname me i would always just very politely correct him he would say sorry and then seemingly get better and try however there was a pattern he would do the exact same process of slipping in my deadname and old gender and i am not stupid so i asked him one day dad you dont think this bible study is going to magically make me detransition right and halfway still believing optimistically that i was maybe imagining the pattern i was promptly disapointed and honestly heartshattered when he said well i cant confirm or deny that i want what god wants son i held my wits and emotions together and corrected him again it would be daughter not son and i honestly dont think we should continue with the study i thought you wanted to reconnect and admit it or not you had other motives he apologized and simply said well the offer still stands barely acknowledging what he was trying to do i had gone on with an optimistic hope but a now validated reserved approach to my dad for further context if you are wondering my mother passed it was the spark that made me fully realize i needed to transition and mind you myself and my partner at the time paid for her funeral i waited until she was cremated and memorialized before coming out to the rest of my family i even gave them all one last christmas with the old me and as fate would have it the year i came out was the year the cincinnati bengals would go to the super bowl the bengals are my dads favorite football team i went with him when neither of my brothers would to his little sports bar he began hanging out in and i gave him that shared experience to watch his team with his son i didnt say anything but in my head that was my old selfs personal goodbye to him as a fatherson dynamic despite these things my father didnt care a following sunday the church he attends will elaborate on why its in quotations later after the bible study attack had failed to convert me back to normal i tuned in to his church livestreams because a i wanted to know what they were preaching and b i still wanted some connection to him to my horror the pastor dropped my deadname and demanded the congregation pray for his salvation in reference to me that was at the time the final straw and i texted my father a long respectful but stern letter explaining i was going to be no contact with him for awhile now as fate would have it my partner at the time would turn abusive at one point even brutally beating me i have documentation of this i was homeless and the only place left would end up being his property i had explained to him that the only thing i would need of him would be to respect my pronouns and name which btw is my birth name because i was a man they all pronounced it different but my mother always intended for it to be pronounced how i pronounce it now anyways i only legally changed my dead middle name to ann after my grandma as my dead middle name was after my grandpa so all in all not even hard to do long story short he would kick me out and i was on my own completely in this time frame i had become ordained and received seminary training in a scathing falling out argument we had i had given him several resources about lgbtq stuff in order to help him understand i was incredibly patient he one day retorted all of my efforts with a simple well none of those studies are christian specific so i dont care about them so i as a christian took up the challenge i gave him articles written by affirming modern day reformation leaders books written by affirming protestant reverends youtube channels ran by affirming pastors and even my own tidbits i had discovered about translation after receiving my art of biblical words certification i would find out later he never even opened any of them he was set in his way for no reason i remember one line even if they dont specifically condemn it they do in fact not explicitly affirm it either so ill never accept it he said a plethora of really disgusting things to me as well in regards to my transness and he seemed angry that i thought i could somehow call myself a christian during my time being homeless again i would whilst doing independent denominational research browse my dads church which i was partially raised in into my denominational searching methods to discover they are a prosperity gospel heretical finacial scamming controlling cult which is heavilly documented and even was attached to a deadly trucking attack in australia and was covered by both abc news and minutes i am eternally grateful that i was not baptized in them i later would become consecrated to the lord via being publicly baptized in an elca lutheran church and i have undergone extensive therapy to undo the damage the cult rhetoric did to my psyche so anyways i would find out from my younger brother m that my father had cheated on our mother while she was alive paired with him lying about ever honestly interacting with my research i freely labored for to share with him my entire image of him is shattered and now those other things i mentioned are glaringly more obvious he never taught me how to be a man i am not a man and again him being a poor excuse of a father is not at all why i transitioned i literally am medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria but i still am deeply hurt and saddened by the fact my dad is a truly horrid parent other things that would come to light would be the beatings i used to remember as well deserved discipline were actually all child abuse and often were being done because we broke rules that were arbitrarily given based on his belief that similar to the cult otherwise completely harmless items content or media were somehow witchcraft or demonically possessed certain things he thought as such about were the dark knight batman movie as the cult had a theory that heath ledger was possessed by a joker spirit demon and thats why he sadly overdosed any non critical mention of any apocryphal texts which again i freely acknowledge as non canon as a protestant myself the tv show modern family as it encouraged queers as lgbtq folks are another topic the cult is insanely hateful of i remember that until highschool i wasnt even allowed to call halloween halloween my older brother had to beg to allow myself and my younger brother a chance to celebrate it and he did as such by having to write a report on the true orgins of halloween to my horror after my dear mother passed he has gone unchallenged as she used to often push back on him he now doesnt even watch tv news he only consumes cult approved content christian youtubers a subject i actually also consume sports and bible readings he rejects anything that counteracts the cult specific interpretations of scripture he told my little brother he was never going to see his mother again and that jesus told him he was evil the damage of being raised by such a man is still present,Positive
when i was and younger my dad would frequently beat me upkick me out of the houseimpose his religious muslim rules on mecurse me out now im and since we dont interact much he only keeps it to the verbal abuse always telling me how im not worth anything and im a good for nothing daughter it really hurts me when i see other girls my age have such kind and caring fathers i feel like he has shattered my confidence so deeply that im a shell of a person i always wondered how many others girls my age had fathers who would punch them or backhand them for minor inconveniences at the age of sometimes i find myself wishing that he dies so i can finally be at peace and not afraid of him im going to be a junior this year and i wanted to apply to really good colleges but because of him i fell into such severe depression that now im a pretty average student with no extracurriculars i cant get a part time job right now because of my visa status so i have to rely on him for money i really want my life to get better does anyone know what to do,Neutral
i decided over year ago to go no contact with my father as he was abusive during my childhood i knew doing this there was a very likely chance he wouldnt try to repare the relationship and just go along with the no contact since this he has gotten engaged and i was a little surprised that he didnt try contact me to inform me today my grandma ran into him and was talking to him and he didnt ask her how me or my sister were i feel unwanted even though i was the one to initiate the no contact,Neutral

my dad genuinely is not capable of having feelings empathy or sympathy for starters but our whole relationship im f and hes m is so surface level and transactional for example im in az where its degrees outside and my power went out my dad said i could come over until it came back on only if i brought him a cheeseburger then i said no and he said then dont come or he will only do something for me if i do something for him he will only pick me up milk from the store if i clean his house or truck nothing is ever just a nice gesture for me hes my dad so i would clean his house if he needed me too anyways for nothing in return but its always a catch with him if he ever offers to do something later on in life he will hold it against you like well i did this for you so now you need to do this for me or pay me back somehow just so irritating how people cant do things out of goodness in their hearts anymore,Neutral
tw so im trying to figure out if what i experienced within my family was sexual abuse for context my mom was a stripper all throughout my childhood her father ran and managed most of the clubs she worked at not all but enough when i was a child and teen i remember my mom being naked most of the time she was under a blanket but it was apparent she was nude once when she was drunk and had hurt herself she needed my help to get into bed she had taken all her clothes off and then sneered at me and told me not to look at her and called me a pervert i wasnt looked by the way i was just trying to help my drunk naked mom into bed at there were times when she would make comments about my developing breasts and poke them and laugh and giggle despite me expressing i didnt like it it felt like she was trying to embarrass me there was also at least one occasion where she barged into the bathroom and took a photo of me naked as i was getting into the shower and again laughed and joked about it and had that photo developed her and my grandfather also would make inappropriate sexual jokes and comments not together or at each other just in general also less conspicuous i guess but she would lick and suck on my step dads tongue in front of us and then laugh when i was grossed out by it my grandfather would make the worst and most sexual comments and talk about bending women over and making grunting sexual noises he would also talk about how frequently him and his wife had sex and things like that all of this was just so normal that even now in my s im just starting to question these things and figure out how to define them i truly dont think my mom at least got any sexual gratification from these things it was more to humiliate and embarrass me and she was incredibly immature in a lot of ways so it feels very gray to me,Positive
so i have been sick all day today with light fever and a cold and a shit load of body ache my mom was out at the parlor all day and asked me to go get my little sister from school even tho im sick btw she didnt know cause she didnt bother to ask duh i ask her to make me a drink to make me feel better ans so she does when she comes in my room she screams at me and threatens to throw the boiling hot drink on me and guess why cause my lights are not turned on properly therefore im not studying my head hurts and so i kept the lights down low and have been doing maths for the last hours even tho i dont feel good we argue for a bit and once she leaves i start crying now i have a major headache and my eye hurts more and i didnt want to bother my friend so im writing this may i remind you i turned weeks ago,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my father single parent has raised me all his life my mother was never in the picture all my life he has been controlling me and telling me how to live my life not to mention the physical and mental abuse he has inflicted on me when i was a child my father is an alcoholic for years now and his entire brain is wired differently hes not capable to see someone elses point or understanding i am f and i still live with him there is some type of codependency between us he always told me how he wants me to dress how he wants me to wear my hair what kind of man i should marry in the future and how i should name my children i am aware that he is probably a narcissist or some of the sort because if i dont end up marrying the kind of man he chooses for me he will be heartbroken he has a victim complex and doesnt respect my feelings or my thoughts i have tried to communicate alot of it with him i have tried to explain to him that i am my own person and that me cutting my hair doesnt make me a bad daughter just because he doesnt like it but he never listens ive repeated myself multiple times but theres no use to it i dont have any siblings so moving out is not an option for me currently my father is very depressed and doesnt see a reason to keep on living except me i dont know what to do he is the reason why i go to therapy and have so many mental issues but he is also my best friend i wish i could just hate him but all i feel for him is pity and alot of guilt if i think of leaving him all alone on his own,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
just a rant a few days ago i was sent to my grandmothers apartment in new york to watch her after eye surgery since my uncle usually gets off work at late times and is unable to care for her to his full capacity i was hesitant at first but after a few days of staying here i felt so free my parents two ivy league students have been very pushy about this college application process even though i know i dont have the grades or skills to get into any of their dream schools for me i dont know where im going with this but this whole trip just gave me so many opportunities to do teenage things i was finally able to call my boyfriend and friends not hear my parents screaming and cursing at one another and i didnt have to deal with my dad yelling and threatening me it felt so nice maybe im not a victim of anything maybe im just over exaggerating and begging for attention but when my mom came over to take me back home my body went hot and i completely lost it i literally feel like im going to pass out i cant go back i dont want to but i realized that if i dont my dad would lose it and hed argue with my mom or call me just to berate me even more i wish i had someone to talk to i wish i could tell my boyfriend i wish highschool was over so id never have to see my dad again i wish i didnt have to accept the reality of this situation and just say im not going and run away from all my problems too bad i cant lol,Neutral
im crying in my room right now after being yelled at through the wall i have ibs and been having a flare up for days now i had diarrhea all day long and multiple stomach cramps making it more comfortable for me to lay in bed and distract myself from being on my laptop as well as doing school work online he has ibs himself so it is not like hes uneducated it began when i was sitting in my room listening to johnnie guilbert songs when i heard him call out saying i need to walk the dogs he knew i was having a rough day w pain and diarrhea however he still asked when i said i couldnt be because i had diarrhea and pain meaning i couldnt risk having a bad accident i could hear him yelling for fuck sake fine them me and ur mom will walk them roughly i can remember nowi know i sound like a brat but hear me out he was yelling it aggressively not like a ok well walk them hes been guilt tripping me and my mom for years i feel insanely uncomfortable around him since when he would get mad and begin screaming which i would end up sobbing if i began sobbing he would get even more mad m friends say i have massive father issues but i think im being dramatic since abuse is physical as if my mental health was crap to begin with,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i read a quote that said having an abusive parent that breaks their back to provide for you is so tumultuous like how can i hate you when you built a life for me from dust but also how can i not when youve hurt me so badly and it stuck with me you are ungrateful if you leave but cry everyday because home doesnt feel like home at all you are unhappy then you are unhappy now idk how to deal with this because people tell you that you are exaggerating because all your needs are getting fulfilled but but what about the constant comparison with my older sister what about the backhanded comments what about the insult in front of others and what about no freedom and making every important decision for me the idea of death feels more alive,Positive
for context my cousin is and im for as long as i remember when visiting my cousin and family she and her sisters were always yelled and always hit by their mother the oldest of the three is getting the brunt of it whether she did anything or not her mother yells and hits her its been getting worse as she gets older with her mother breaking her nose stepping on her head and causing her face to get scratched it got so bad time that her younger sister got involved in a very bad fight that her heart stopped and the ambulance had to be called to get her heart moving again recently my cousin broke up with her idiot cheating boyfriend and her mom is trying to get the two of them back together i dont know why her mom is so persistent with her to be with this guy in her eyes because he doesnt do drugs smokes gambles comes from rich family etc that she should give this cheating scumbag a second chance its gotten to the point that she is constantly calling her following her and not allowing her to hang out with her friends go to her friends wedding and so on and so forth complete isolation bar family my uncle is basically never home due to his job where he is constantly driving and when he gets home he is so exhausted that all he has the energy for is to eat and sleep my grandmother is the one who fiercely protects her like a shield otherwise her mother would do worse things i suggested calling the police however she lives in a country where reputation is extremely important and calling the police would damage the familys reputation severely i suggested getting a job but she said that her mother wouldnt allow it i also suggested for her to stay with our grandparents as they have more than enough space but she said that her mother wouldnt allow it and would hit her and force her to come back home she is so done and she wants to get as far away as possible from her mother she wants to cut contact completely she has no idea how she can escape from her clutches one of her ideas is to get married andor leave the country completely at this point she doesnt know what to do and i have no idea how to help her please help,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

raise your hand if youve developed an overly simple flavorless writing style because the adults in your life taught you not to waste their time with any interesting elaborate explanations that couldve made your writing more engaging or if youve been slowly killing off your sense of humor after years of hearing it described as your dumb jokes despite the parent loving stuff like snl which exclusively has normal logical humor thats perfectly acceptable for adults to enjoy all because theyre too busy self sabatoging themselves to realize or care how much its hurting your self image,Positive
for context im f commuting to college and live with my dad to save money my parents lived together since i was and i used to legally have to be at a parents house for certain days of the week until i turned after turning i stopped going to my moms house because it felt a bit uncomfortable there my mom recently got a boyfriend which would be okay to me except his presence bothers me my mother was very verbally physically and arguably emotionally abusive towards me growing up by growing up i mean since i could remember up until now but it has gotten much less severe my dad was not emotionally there for me and he did occasionally yell at me and physically hit me when i was very young but it was only traumatizing to me one time but he was much less emotional as my mom as ive grown up i realized that maybe my parents want to change to be better or theyre not as stressed out enough to let their anger foster that way my dad has been really chill for a while now and im starting to forgive him as hes shown he truly cares and wants whats best for me we have never talked about it but i can sense it my mom is a different case my mom has continued the yelling and the randomly getting angrymean and it genuinely scares me its the only thing that can make me lose control of my emotions and just cry its not full on screaming anymore but its definitely sudden anger and belittling she was not angry at all times during my childhood i loved when she was happy bc she made me feel loved she did not hug me or show me affection but she spent time with me and i enjoyed it to me that was love i know theres probably a woman very broken in her but i cant let go of the constant fear i feel around her its physical fear and its scary i fear that the good mother will go away and i get bad mother that makes me feel so awful i know i am not the best person either when you live with anger issues you get anger issues couple that with religious trauma and discovering my sexuality i could find myself repeating her anger and arguing with those very close to me i am working on myself and getting better and i wasnt nearly as far gone as her i want to forgive her but this is my predicament shes got a new boyfriend that moved in and shes visibly a happier person at least to the eye but shes kind of cut off my grandparents who helped her so much as a single parent after having the stability of having a partner to me it feels a little icky but its not my problem so i feel wrong to foster hatred towards her maybe they hurt her like she hurt me and thats why once she was secure she was done with themi only know this information because my grandparents call me constantly asking me about whats wrong with her and urging me to ask her myself because she has ghosted them this leads me to believe she truly did not grow and she can turn into bad mom real quick especially if the boyfriend is gone they have been together for years now but i am someone that low key does not believe in love ik working on that so my fear is consuming me because im afraid they will eventually break up i dont want to be hurt and disappointed again because every time she showed me kindnessi thought she was turning a new leaf and every time i was met with heartbreak with a boyfriend i now have a measure of when she will go back to bad mom forgot to mention but she also acts mean and belittles me when he is not present but this is only sometimes but not all the time but she has never acted like that in front of him also a fear factor but she has been acting so nice to me and i just know theres someone who is deeply hurt inside of her but i have just been avoidantghosting her subconsciously to protect myself i hate the feeling of guilt and i also want to protect myself any advice anyone else have a similar experience anything would help really,Positive

so for context im f i lived with my mom my whole life until months ago i moved into an amazing foster home while i stayed w my mom i got abused alot through these years in all ways an can image my mom were never at home she would work all day bc thats where the money comes and she would often travel for days to meet up with guys while i were left home alone the first time i were only years we also mooved houses about times in years we almost never had food and i would often go hungry i had never experienced having dinner with people and my mom never attend things at school so i would be the only child without parents i had to do all of the chores in a home at a very young age and take care of my siblings as if i were their mother when my mom would come home from work she would often be mad all i can remeber is countless of times where she would hit me choke me and break up the doors if i even tried to lock them through all these years she would tell me things a mother shouldnt tell their child and i thought these things were right and normal list of things my mom repetietly would say no one is ever gonna want you i do not want you i rather wanna die than have you you are misreable you are weak you never make me happy i wish i never birth you these are very hurtful things for a child to hear ecpecially it was for me because growing up and i still am a child who were always quiet and never did anything wrong i never shouted or yelled at anyone,Positive
my very young sister is being abused and i need advice on how to move forward i really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and perhaps direct me to a better subreddit give advice on how to deal w this situation please read below as details are important im an adult with an established life who lives mins away from my parents and very young elementary school aged sibling as a child i experienced mostly emotional abuse to a pretty severe extent mostly by my mother there was also multiple instances of physical abuse one instance which left bruise marks on head and arms exclusively done by father he also physically abused my mother i did not have contact with any family members except my parents so there was no adult around to save me i called the police on my father a few times but my mother would vouch for him even tho i had photographs of my bruises so the police never did anything as i grew up my father chilled out and we developed a pretty good relationship while my mother and i continue to have a very bad relationship my father and i have suspicions that my mother has narcissistic personality disorder and i myself have been diagnosed with borderline pd my mothers verbalemotional abuse has gotten worse toward my sibling and she treats my sibling much worse than she ever treated me she does not abuse me anymore i have basically completely cut her off given that my father had stopped abusing me and my mother and i saw growth in him i assumed that he had changed and felt safe leaving my sibling with my parents and moving out to start my own life assuming he would step in the way i did when i lived at home however since ive moved out my sibling has been telling me about increasingly bad instances of abuse including my father physically abusing her once very recently i have no doubt it will only get worse as its following the exact same pattern as it did when i was younger but to a greater degree now shes younger than i was when it started and my mother is much more abusive to her than she was to me its been horrifying seeing the same things that happened to me start happening to her naturally im extremely worried about her and realize that i am literally the only adult able to help her and i dont think i could forgive myself if i didnt at least try to gain custody of her so shes away from these monsters please note ive started gathering evidence asking her to take videos of them yelling at her and have taken vids of her telling me about the physical abuse with her consent unfortunately things arent straightforward as she ultimately still has deep attachments to her parents shes very young and they are very good at brushing their abuse under the rug pretending like its no big deal and having a great day the next day think of an abusive relationship where love bombing follows the abuse then the cycle repeats she doesnt want me to take custody of her even though we have a great relationship and i act as a parental figure to her anyways shes also only a child and certainly unable to understand the ramifications of being abused as a child i also thought it was horrible but didnt understand how much it fucked me up in the long term until i was much older i also am worried about actually having custody as im in school for my doctorate and barely have time to exist asis however of course i would put anything aside to ensure my sibling grows up feeling safe and loved unconditionally lastly i have a semigood relationship with my father hes good when hes not hitting women and children lol and despite how stupid i feel saying this i have a sliver of hope that maybe with therapy and anger management he may be able to improve that side of him i am a bit worried about going through a custody battle and losing the last family i have left him i truly dont know what to do hearing the stories watching the videos my sister takes and knowing this abuse is going on is taking a huge toll on me its like someones tying my hands and forcing me to watch my sister be tortured and fucked up for life shes adamant she doesnt want to separate from her parents but i feel such a responsibility to do something about this im also about to legally be a mandated reporter once i finish my degree for now ive asked her to please not share details with me if she doesnt want my help and to instead just tell me if she needs something physically for me to pick her up for me to make her food and drop it off for her if her mom doesnt feed her out of anger etc but i still feel horrible telling a baby that she shouldnt tell me about the abuse shes experiencing i am getting her a therapist but she cant really talk about the abuse without risking being reported but i also cant hear it and its severely impacting my mental health again im already not doing great given i have borderline personality disorder and was depressed for most of my life not anymore and have had attempts at taking my own life i truly dont know what to do in this situation and am afraid to talk to anyone like a lawyer or therapist as they would likely immediately report thank you so much if you read all the way to the end and please drop any advice you have as ive truly never faced a situation where ive been stumped like this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im going to be a blunt as possible my dad was my abuser and although he isnt in my life anymore and never will be i have a hard time dealing with the fact i feel like i need him to pass before ill get any peace of mind he has a heart condition and is untreated so i find it becoming less and less of a hypothetical everyday but i was hoping for any advice or shared experiences to help navigate the following years or however long is left in his hour glass,Neutral

tw self harm incest child abuse im an adult male and have a lot of intrusive thoughts about harming myself issues with intimacy substance abuse issues and difficulties with functioning that a lot of people chalk up to autism although tests dont show i have autism some kinds of ptsd can be misdiagnosed as autism as a kid i engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with exclusively male peers and tried to talk other boys into selfharming themselves in their genital region which is a recurring intrusive thought for me even today the most suspicious thing is how my father always talked in a very sexuallycharged ways this hypersexualized vibe even showed up when my father told me about the birds and the bees when i was far too young maybe yo or younger i also had not asked about this topic he told me about the birds and the bees in a very graphic way that made me and my mother uncomfortable and continued talking despite my mother chiding him a bit he also told me within this same conversation about a time where he got a girl drunk and stayed sober himself so he could feel her up when she was passed out it is really chilling to me that not only did he think it was appropriate to tell a child about sex in a super graphic way but he also told me about him sexually assaulting somebody my father is also a self admitted porn addict which was very much in my face when i was growing up theres even a picture in my baby photo album of my father clothed looking at porn with me as newborn sleeping on his shoulder my father once talked about his porn watching habits around the dinner table when i was a teenager and when my stepsister got super uncomfortable he laughed off her concerns and kept talking about it another event was when i was around yo my father came home drunk he was a self described alcoholic and talked to me a bit and somehow got to straddling me clothed and bouncing up and down on me in a very weird way that i think i registered as being weird even as a kid my father also openly had a crush on a yo girl on a vacation i was with him on when i was around he would take suggestive pictures of her all the time told the girls father in front of me that he had a crush on her and joked to her face about his crush on her another reason i think some abuse may have happened to me is some of the aforementioned behavior as a kid when i was i talked a male peer into going into a bathroom and touching each others genitalia even weirder was a pattern of behavior where i tried to talk male peers into causing themselves pain in their genitalia the first time was when i was maybe and involved me placing objects on a slide so that it would hit my male peers in the balls i remember referring to this as a peepee torture which is just so deeply alarming for such a young child another time i tried to talk my male peer into putting ice in his swim trunks as well as put his genitalia in a jacuzzi pool jet other solo things i did in this vein were tying things to my genitals and tying the other end to an elevator and closing toys with sharp hinges on my genitals i continue to have a recurring intrusive thought about causing harm to my genitalia this is extremely alarming to me and some part of my difficulty with intimacyextreme performance anxiety you may ask what my mother was doing this whole time and the answer is nothing when i asked her about some of my inappropriate behavior as a child weird thing to ask my mother but i couldnt find effective therapy and was doing really badly and she blurted out that it was normal and told me a terrifying story about an unnamed male child engaging in incest with his sleeping unknowing sister she told me the sex act the brother did to his sister too telling me this horrifying story with the subtext of all kids do weird things this story also reveals that my mom doesnt really think that abuse is a big deal its just a weird quirky thing what do you think of this does it sounds like something may have happened or are my concerns explained some other way,Positive
ok so my relationship is not good with my mother she was never there and has done some stuff which ill not elaborate rn cause thats not the topic of discussion rn ik she has hurt me and the childhood me in many ways and i recently decided to distance myself from her but im thinking does forgiveness help i mean idk i know as a fact that i have no energy in my heart left to go back and fix stuff like literally i cant do that to myself anymore so idk can someone just tell me more about forgiveness and healing a relationship,Neutral
some needed context prior to this incident when i was in th grade there was this incident where i brought an old phone to class so i could play a game with my friends during recess my mother allowed me to bring it to school but i think she never brought it up with my dad later during the day when my dad arrived home he called me name and confronted me about it i responded truthfully and he took out his belt and began beating the shit out of me i was screaming in pain and shriveled into a ball on the floor if it wasnt for my sisters intervening i wouldve been sent to the hospital that event left me scarred ever since ive been avoiding my dad as much as i can since just looking at his face makes my fight or flight response activate i dont know if it should be labeled as ptsd since i dont want to jump to conclusions now for the incident that happened recently i was watching my show while eating dinner and my dad just appears out of nowhere and starts bad mouthing it as he does with anything i watchdo i just sat at the table debating if i should turn it off and leave or just sit there i came to a conclusion and turned it off since he obviously didnt like the show which was haikyuu and i just went to my room as i was done with my food a few minutes later he barges in my room and starts yelling at me like whyd you turn of the tv whyd you fucking do that and im shaking and bawling my eyes out as hes yelling at me he then picked up the mug on my table and threw water on me and just as the title says he threatened to throw the mug at me im sitting there on my bed having a panic attack and all my dad says is that i shouldnt be crying since he didnt hit me my mom walks in and just doesnt do anything but when he leaves she just says i shouldnt be crying since i brought this on myself i dont know if i really did bring this on myself or not,Neutral
i tend to find it extremely easy to emotionally bond with and have empathy for animals especially cats but i tend to often find it harder to open myself up in that way to humans i suspect this is because while my parents were often emotionally abusive or neglectful we had cats and our cats were always there for me i always played with them when i was sad i could cuddle up with them stuff like that and i have this feeling that cats being this emotionally supportive presence in my life whereas my parents were often not and sometimes quite the opposite is what caused me to feel this way about cats compared to humans anyone else have something similar,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i genuinely need help my parents think im going insane basically i had a lock on my door its one of those metal slidey ones i say had because my dad has broken two of them and now i use wooded lollipop sticks instead of the metal slider so no one barges in while im changing this may sound narcissistic but im very smart im the smartest in my grade and i always get perfect scores in tests i never ask my parents for help regarding school i dont have any allergies or phobias and i dont create a fuss today my dad barged into my room because i was getting stressed about what clothes to wear for an event it was business casual and i only own hoodies and leggings he proceeded to scream at me block my door so i couldnt leave and threaten to lock me up in a mental asylum my mum came in and was crying i started shouting because my room was very messy i was wearing pyjamas they werent letting me leave i was on my period so mood swings i had a migraine etc for about an hour they screamed at me and i wont deny that i screamed back my mum kept saying that i was too anxious over nothing shes convinced that i have anxiety and yet theyve never took me to a therapist or whatever all my friends with things like that get counselling in school i dont like celebrations where im the centre of attention for example my birthday i asked if we could just treat my birthday like any regular day this year but they refused my mum said it was ok and that i didnt have to do anything and yet today she said that something was wrong with me because i couldnt even open birthday presents in front of my family i said that i couldnt look at them the same and that i planned to leave the house as soon as i could and never come back she started hysterically laughing at me while i was sobbing and said that i was being dramatic unfortunately i have to live here for three more years but im going to look into getting emancipated id like to get therapy or something but idk i feel like i could be way worse im a perfect student i barely complain and i get things done i dont understand why everyone makes such a huge fuss over me not being social and not liking attention yeah its unusual but i dont think it makes me insane i cant give much more info for fear of them finding me but i will try answer any questions i genuinely want people to be honest if you think im a psychopath tell me the truth and tell me what i can do,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i have always viewed my mum as safe and like she was going through the same thing as me so it felt like she understood i have now slowly come to the realisation that she was an adult and i was only a child and she should have protected me against his abuse she completely ignored the fact he was abusing me and ignored the signs that i was suffering she saw my self harm and did and said nothing to me as she knew his abuse was the cause and she had no intention of addressing it,Neutral
i am not sure what to do in this situation i feel so lost and confused and like there is no escape i just want to let it out it hurts keeping it as a secret for years my mother and i have always been close and on a good and normal day when she doesnt drink she is my closest friend almost like the gilmore girls she is very dramatic eccentric and childish however the moment she drinks she gets extremely violent and says a lot of mean things to me that i am unable to forget no matter how much time passes or the amount of times she says she is sorry i am a very shy person who is really quiet but i also get angry easily and that is because my mom knows all of the trigger words that result in my becoming short tempered for example blaming me in every situation we were at the store she wanted to get a cola but forgot and she blamed me for not reminding her ever since i was a kid my mother would turn into an extremely childish person who would want to be in the center of attention after a few drinks and would do silly things like sing dance pee on the floor etc i always tried to stop her from the embarrassment or looking like an idiot infront of people but then she would get focused on me and start to attack me a lot of times verbally my moms abusive nature would come out even when she doesnt drink like if i would spill something she would beat me up so i would always try to wipe any spills or drops with my sock when i was so here a few situations my father and mother were arguing like a usual couple but my mom would take it in a wrong way and instead of being an adult she would victimize herself and say that she wasted years of her life on me and him she would hit my dad and when my dad isnt at home she would take it out on me in one of the instances she once hit me with a belt and the metal part hit my eye i had to go to the first day of school with a black eye whenever my mom drinks she would say things like i would have aborted you you have no friends my teacher tells you how much all of your friends hate you you are an abusive sad person i hate your voice it is your own fault because of you i wasted years of my life you are loser and you have achieved nothing as a kid she left me alone with babysitters to go out with her friends to bar or clubs and come back late and pass out my mother and i didnt have a relationship whatsoever as a kid and alot of time i felt as though she resented me it felt like i had to compete with her for my fathers attention and she would on purpose make me uncomfortable by walking around the house in sexy lingerie or tell me that she wants to have sex with my dad and i have to leave the house all of that would make me super uncomfortable and as a preteen it made me angry that she would tell me stuff like that so i fought with her a lot my dad would side with me but my mom would say of course the two of you protect each other i am alone type crap she would kick me throw chairs at me and when i was super mad and took her phone away because she was calling random people to complain about how i am a very bad person she grabbed a knife and told me to give back her phone she was extremely drunk then every time she would mess up she would reverse the situation and gaslight me into thinking none of it happened and i imagined it because i am an egotistical person and that i am abusive after a few rounds of arguments regarding the fact that i am a bad person and she is the victim she would constantly tell me to come and to hug her and she would say forget about it we are both at fault i love you but my heart would ache from the pain i had to endure just last night she came back from a wedding drunk and we had a very bad fight she did her usual do something stupid to make me mad i get upset and tell her to stop doing something she verbally insults me i tell her to go to sleep i grab her and make her go to her room she attacked me and i had no sleepcuz she kept coming to fight she woke up and blamed me from being physical with her and that she is scared of me what the hell should i do,Positive

i have a situation a friend of mine f she is and always has been a model student and daughter who always puts her family first and scores the top grades through school and college with her teachers and colleagues singing her praises to her parents she is being mistreated by her ungrateful parents who are hell bent on controlling her every living moment and decesion she has no social life because of them and if once in a blue moon she tries to go out with her friends it becomes into a whole fiasco with her parents and younger brother berating her about how she doesnt care about her familys reputation even though she has never done anything to put even a blemish on it and has only raised it ever since she could think on her own her brother on the other hand who she naively cherishes and would do anything for is an ungrateful son of a bitch who only takes and takes from her is a failure in every scope of his life takes advantage of her love and makes demands of her like he deserves anything but a slap though anychance he gets he creates doubt in her parents mind about her character and how she might be talking to her boyfriend anytime she is on a call or is spending time with him anytime she is even half an hour late to come home from work all he does for her is put fuel in the fire that she is trapped in her parents though act all progressive and liberal about how she is the apple of their eye and how they ask in front of their relatives but in the walls of their own home they threaten her by saying that they will marry her off anytime she does something on her own volition something that makes her happy and even her brother adds to it and often suggests it himself they say that she may do anything she likes after she is married off when she says that she has a job a college life that she is committed to they say that it doesnt matter and she can just stop going all in all they want to tie her up and never let her leave the house she is not even able to go at the end of her street without being bombarded by questions her father puts up her every act as a threat to his reputation even though it is her brother who is very well capable and willing to drown it and she has only glorified his so called reputation ever since she was she helped him in his business taught him how to use his own fucking computer when she was but all of that is either forgotten by them or they dont care and are just ungrateful bastards as her friend i want to make them pay atleast realise what kind of gem their daughter is because i am not kidding or overdoing it one but that she is the kind of daughter people pray for and someday i might too please give me ideas or another way so that i can help this friend of mine,Positive

im and i really needed to make some money to save up for a car i sent some applications to a few places but got no answer from any my mom told me to get a job where she works at so i applied and got the job during the interview the manager slightly mentioned that he knows how hard my mom works also complimented her on a few other things and because he knows how hard my mom works he assumed that i will be the same though i can agree shes a hard worker him praising her really upset me he praised her on how nice and respectful she was and i couldnt help but feel awful i know this might be stupid and he only knows her as a good hardworking employee and not a physically and emotionally abusive mother and i know its not his fault but him praising her really just upset me it just sucks to see her get praised when shes so awful to me and my siblings i know that at work shes so nice and her coworkers like her but i just cant wrap my head around the fact that shes so kind at work and calm but she gets home and gets upset at the smallest reason and starts yelling i know that its dumb for me to get upset knowing that her coworkers have no idea how she really is but i cant help myself,Positive
i f am planning on going abroad for my degree not necessarily out of my country but out of my state in order to pursue psychology as none of the colleges in my town or state are any good for psychology my parents on the other hand insist that it is not necessary and that they would miss me when im gone i dont understand why people who have abused me for so long and say they regretted giving birth to me cant think logically whenever it comes to my future i understand that theyd miss me but isnt it important for me to grow and be independent sometimes theyre overbearing and other times theyre assholes i dont know how to convince them to go abroad esp since theyre still deadset on me pursuing medical even tho i have made it very clear i do not wish to do so they keep insisting its because my future will be good filled with money and ill be successful even though being happy is also my priority how do i convince my parents to let me study psychology abroad,Positive

before i narrate my experience i want to clarify that i live in an asian country where women cant move out of their homes unless theyre moving ou of citycountry or until they get married my mother and i were extremely close during my early childhood since my birth my parents had shifted to another city in which we had no family due to my fathers job as an only child i grew extremely comfortable of having only them around and was very attached to both of them however even then my mother had always been extremely strict and critical for example shed always expect me to be at the top of my class and i remember being scared of not coming first because what would my mother think of me regardless i had a very codependent attachment style with her and remember loving her a lot all of that changed when my father took retirement and we were supposed to shift back to my parents previous hometown my mother and i shifted a few months earlier than my dad and i was only at that time the only place she could think of staying was at her own parents home who had died and this is also where her sister resided with her family we took the upper floor but my world turned upside down when my mothers sister started abusing me in every way imaginable except sexually sometimes she would mock me and ridicule me for my appearance and when id complain she would beat me up relentlessly shoes belts slaps punches you name it other times she would just call me disobedient and use that as an excuse to beat me up in all of those occasions my mother never intervened she never protected me she never even stepped in and said stop what you are doing to my daughter shed just watch me getting beaten up and then later come to me and tell me that its for your own good when id threaten them that i would call and tell my father they would lock me up and prevent me from speaking to him all of my calls with him would be monitored in fact whenever my fathers siblings would visit and we would visit them id be told to not tell them anything personal because we shouldnt tell anyone what goes on at home what happens at home is private and cant be discussed once my father moved in with us things got better for a while until it started again in other ways my father got another job and hed be away for most of the day if my aunt wouldnt hit me id be ridiculed shamed for absolutely everything i used to love sketching at the time and she would mock me for being so bad at it and i remember once that she saw a sketch made by me tore it up and threw it on the floor and then she brought the broom and put it in the trash i dont remember sketching after that day even during those incidents my mother never stepped in instead when id try to fight for myself she would scold me and then later force me to apologise to her sister when my father would step in hed get thrashed by my mother a couple of years later my father bought and built a home for us to move into and thats when my nightmare came true my mothers sister decided to move in with us she used the excuse that she had to sell her parents home as my mother wanted her share of the property and somehow she was our responsibility now my father had absolutely no say in the matter as my mother had made his life hell also why he never took a divorce i will never understand and maybe thats the only thing i will never forgive him for in our new home my aunt tortured me just as much i was then once when i fought back she tried to suffocate me with my own pillow i remember my mother meekly asking her to not to do it she also scratched me on my face and i remember having a giant scar on my eyebrow and my mother blackmailed me into not telling anyone why i got it i dont understand how or why i obeyed her but i did i told no one they moved away a couple months after that it wasnt because of what she had done to me but because her husband could finally afford to pay rent in a separate home the physical abuse stopped and hasnt happened to this day she was always a tormentor though and is to this day since my mother is still pretty close to her she is often visiting our place and sometimes she says or does something because of which i fight back even after all these years my mother never took my side my relationship with my mother never got fixed because of this she never defended me and i will never forgive her for it last week an incident occurred because of which i had to intervene and i did so in a very calm manner next thing i know my aunt called screamed at me and called me names before cutting the calls i was not at all disrespectful even though considering the monster she is i should have been my mother was listening to all of this and her next move wasnt at all surprising she called her sister and started taking her side and after that call when i screamed at her about her sister being such a monster my mother had the audacity to scream at me and asked me to shut up since that fight my mother and i have not spoken in fact after pulling verbally abusing me her sister had the audacity to come over to our place and taunt me again but this time i was firm and fought back equally which pissed my mother off even more what broke my heart most was how my mother was sitting with her sister having coffee and the only thing i could think of was i would never sit with my daughters abuser much less give them my time of the day in previous incidents when something like this occurred i try my best to communicate with my mother later i try to tell her how much her actions have traumatised me and how my entire life has been affected by her lack of protecting me and each time she promises to do better either that or she finds horrible excuses to defend herself or even her sister if nothing else she asks me to forgive and forget i have been to therapy and i have tried everything in the book to help myself get through this i want to break free of this constant pain of feeling unsafe i have occasional nightmares and wake up crying and screaming and in all of those nightmares what hurts more isnt that my aunt is abusing me but that my mother never defends me i cannot move out of the country because my father is old and sick and the only family i really have i love him enough to give up everything else in the world but all this pain is making me go insane and i no longer know what to do i dont involve my father usually because of his health problems but when i do he stands by my side and fights for me but it is pointless because my mother is extremely controlling and emotionally blackmails everyone i want to clarify that it may seem that my mother is lonely and dependent on her sister and that is not true it may also seem that my mother is in an abusive marriage which could explain why she thinks its okay to tolerate abuse and that is also not true my father although not the most romantic man on earth has never even spoken to my mother in a loud tone he has always been caring loving and supportive despite my mother treating him like absolute shit,Positive

before i start i just wanted to apologize if anything i say doesnt make sense i have a very hard time wording things properly especially when im talking about something sensitive so pls bare with me growing up i never really had a good relationship with my father after i turned f i think is when our relationship started getting bad he used to yell at me just to come into the living room so he could yell at me again about my weight which to be fair i was a bigger kid but our familys diet didnt help that one bit my father liked having meat red meat potatoes and a slice of bread every night after work and he hated it when my mom and i would eat something else hed go on about how theres no point in us even eating as a family anymore if we dont eat the same meal oh and if supper wasnt ready when he got home he got home at around pm he owns a roofing company so he controls his hours he would pout about it for hours on end and accuse my mom of trying to starve him all day because he refused to eat during the day despite being diabetic another thing that was an issue with my weight was my insulin resistance which i didnt even know i had until recently anyways because of my insulin resistance my neck used to be really dark and my dad thought that was because i wasnt washing myself properly so he would make my mom scrub my neck everyday for months until my neck was bleeding and it would be a scab the next day no one thought that they shouldve brought me to a doctor even once he also found it entertaining to torment my mom and i we spent most of our summers traveling on the road and camping with family and his favourite thing to do was either grab me or my mom and yell really really loud to scare us while he was driving and me and my mom both have severe anxiety so you can imagine how it affected us my father was also just really weird towards me i remember this one morning i was getting ready for my schools picture day i was in grade or something like that so this was still very exciting and fun for me so i spent all morning picking out my outfit and curling my hair with my mom we put sparkly hairspray in my hair and i loved it and the first thing my dad did was look me up and down whistle and called me sexy this happened maybe more times he even called one of my younger cousins from another province sexy she was like or maybe we had a lot of horses when i was younger and my father had a close friend who was a farrier he put horse shoes on horses and trimmed their hooves and stuff and everyone had this running joke i dont think it was actually a joke but this is what everyone said it was so i say it was where i was dating the farrier ill call him r in this post ig and there were so many times where he would grab me and sit me on his lap and sometimes my parents would leave me in the barn alone with him and he would try kiss me and touch me my mom never said anything about what was happening and my dad always laughed it off and called me rs girlfriend himself i also had a niece whos older than me by or years and when i was she would get me to sneak out to our old farm trucks to smoke cigarette butts and when we were home alone my sister would bring her to my dads so we could play together she would turn on a porn channel on the tv and make me watch with her there were hundreds of times where we got caught but no one ever said or done anything it was always a quick oh you shouldnt be watching that and someone would switch the channel and move on though we did get caught smoking and we got into deep shit for that one of my sisters smelt cigarette smoke in the basement one morning and told my dad im sorry if this is a huge mess with grammar and spelling mistakes i have only shared this with my therapist and i have tried to talk to my mom a few times so i can maybe get some closure on some stuff but everytime i have she either plays it off calls me over dramatic or invalidates me i wanted to try lift the weight off my shoulders at least a little more than i have with my therapist because of the things i had to put up with my mental health has had a tight grip on my life but i think im finally starting to slowly heal,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

im writing this as im coming to the realization that i will be leaving my two younger brothers with my father who is verbally and physically abusive towards us since i was born my dad has been verbally and physically abusive he would get mad when things did not go his way or when he did not like how events played out i did not know this behavior was not normal until one day when i was younger and he had hit me and told me to cover up the next day before school so that no teachers took me away he would only hit me when i did bad things as a child misbehaved or got bad grades in school he wanted me to be this perfect child the same went towards my sister who is two years younger than me he always tells me when i die you will be grateful and remember how i raised you but thats far from the truth he did not hit my mother but he did verbally abuse her and my grandparents for years he would call me all sorts of names and degrade me as he punished me for my bad behavior that i now know is things kids do at times like spill water on the floor or being scared of the dark i am currently and im about to move out to be closer to my college campus my sister who is just about to start college is going to be dorming at her new college this leaves my two younger brothers age and to stay living with him although my dad is not longer as abusive as he once was and as strict it is still pretty bad i cant stand the thought of leaving my little brothers to endure that type of physical and mental abuse they are both the kind and shy my youngest brother who is has adhd and anxiety diagnosed by a doctor already which my dad does not believe he says the doctors are wrong since such things do not exist i can already see how scared my brothers are of him and im worried they will suffer the way me and my sister did when we were younger i see how my dad screams yells berates and even hits them but im too scared to say or do anything for fear of what he might say or do to me he has threatened to hit me or kick me out since my brothers are financially dependent on my dad and mom i dont know what to do i want to step in and stop him from yelling or hitting them but im scared im years old but i still get scared of what he will do to me i cant even hate him properly since he is still my dad i just need advice on what to do,Positive
im not sure where it all began but the earliest i can remember is when i was being groomed it was from the ages of im now she found out about it and called the cops on the guy now sure that seems like a decent parenting move until after she made the call she came into my room dragged me by my hair and told me that the only person you should be calling daddy is your father and that id never know what a penis would feel like who would say that to their kid let alone a year old sure i was a dickhead kid and tried sneaking on my devices after she took them all away but it was only to contact my school friends she noticed the tablet was gone and came into my room so i pretended to be asleep she saw it as i was trying to get back in contact with the guy that groomed me so her best idea was to tell me to wake the fuck up and when i wouldnt move she started beating me of course she took the tablet away from me but what is beating me senseless gonna do it didnt stop there either the summer after i caught myself trying to run away because of an argument we had over my room being a complete mess she had kept bickering with me over it and i wasnt having it so i told her to leave me alone and she went batshit she took one of my mason jars filled with beads and smashed it at my feet of course i stepped in it while closing my door and i decided i was going to leave through the fire escape i ran all the way to my friends house and she tracked me there and had the police called my whole family showed up and she took my phone away weve gotten into many petty arguments since and i have been trying to avoid her until tonight my sister follows in my mothers footsteps and is like her little pet she snitches and me and all types of other shit she got me in trouble over a charger which caused my mom to go on a rant about how i am disrespectful and spoiled and the least i could do is help out with my sister which i do indeed do more than i should have to if she goes to work at am and wakes up at am my sister is awake at the time so why not feed her before you leave she takes minutes to get ready every time i try talking to her she ends up venting about herself and i hate it she tells me that i can talk to her yet makes it about herself all the time ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety yet whenever i try explaining to her that i can get myself out of it on my own she gets mad and starts taking away the things i like doing as if theyre a distraction with the way she acts im scared of even moving out when i turn in fear of what shell do to my stuff or me to make it so that i cant yes i do realize that she cannot legally do that but its hard for me to get the courage for it ive told many people and i have gone to the police about it a few times but they have always taken her word for it over mine because shes an adult i know for a fact that all my nearby relatives that could take me in while im not with her are on her side and they see me as disrespectful and lazy because of the things she tells them about me she has made threatening remarks in the past month about blacking out on me or punching me in my face or even going as far as saying shed drag me down the stairs by my hair shes made many comments regarding my body and how we need to get in shape though she had to get surgery to lose hers and doesnt even go through with it she will go days without buying groceries and claims that shes depressed and stressed about work and compares it to my diagnosis at every opportunity she gets i dont know what to do as far as taking action to get out and ive been seeking help for the longest reddit is my only option at this point i barely use this app to begin with lol,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mom often puts me down by stating things like im irresponsible or that i dont care about anything and it honestly makes me really mad and upset if i fiercely tell her to stop because it hurts my feelings shell think im just talking back and being disrespectful how do i very nicely tell her to keep quiet and not say things like that because they make me feel like maybe i am irresponsible and thats not good for my selfesteem in a way where she actually listens and stops,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mom was abusive and a drug addict she abused and starved me locked me in a room and pretty much lowered me down to nothing but a maid my siblings grew up calling me slave until i was years old i left my moms to go live with my dad who wasnt in my life before i was everything was going so well until i found out hes a domestic abuser he beat my stepmom and really hurt her when my child was months old everyone forgave him i was iffy and he seemed to really be working on himself and bettering his mental health i was so willing to give him another chance and have a relationship with my daughter never leaving him alone with her though ever he did it again recently cutting him off hurts me but ive already cut off my own mother so its something that im used to however what hurts the most is knowing my baby is going to grow up not knowing either of her biological grandparents im so thankful that my stepmom took on the role of grandma and loves her but i know one day shes going to ask questions about my parents and thats going to be a hard conversation i know its the best thing for her but it shouldnt have been this way in the first place she was just getting to the age where she knew grandpa and had gotten so attached to him and it really breaks my heart for her idk this shit is just so hard,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i was very sensory seeking when i was little and sometimes when i was in the bathtub i would get on my arms like i was doing a push up and then start rocking back and forth because i liked the way the bumpy texture on the bottom of the shower felt on my skin and i figured out at some point that my penis was more sensitive than most of my other parts so i would sometimes rock back and forth against the floor for the sensory input it wasnt sexual because i had no concept of that as a small child but sometimes my body would react to the stimulation my earliest memory is my of older cousin who i i later confirmed was at the time coming in to check on me in the bathtub for some reason and her catching me doing this when i would have been and her yelling at me when she realized what i was doing her yelling scared me so i got out of the bath and ran crying to my mother but when i tried to hug her she saw that i was naked and that i had an erection from the physical stimuli of the aforementioned sensory seeking behavior i remember her face turning bright red with anger as she pushed me away to grab me by my arm with a death grip and then she spanked me with her other hand until it felt like my whole back was on fire i remember my cousin crying and begging her to stop and my mother yelling at her to get out once she was finally done spanking me she made me stand up and then forced me go stand in the corner with my nose against the wall still naked sobbing and covered with my own snot shaking like crazy from fear and pain i remember her making me stand there until i was so tired i physically fell over then she spanked me again until i was screaming and i either passed out or blocked out the rest because i dont remember her stopping the next thing i remember i was laying face down on her bed and she sat next to me and put a frozen bag of something on my butt and legs i remember that she told me that i had been a very bad boy and that because she loved me so much she had to punish me to make sure i learned my lesson and didnt go to hell i still to this day as a now year old man have an incredibly hard time engaging in any form of sexual intimacy after working with a therapist i decided to bring up this memory to my mother when i confronted her she looked at me like i was crazy and accused me of making it up and called me sick she told it was a perverted fantasy that came only from my brain and told me to seek help i then brought it up a few weeks later with my older cousin she confirmed that she remembered it happening and cried because she felt like she caused it she was also a child i never blamed her i have talked to my therapist about it at length and part of me wants to confront my mother again with my cousin to back me up the other part of me knows that it doesnt matter how much proof i have she isnt going to admit it,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mom has been verbally abusive since i was about im now and had to grow up way too fast ill start from the beginning when i was under she would do stuff like yell at me constantly and point out how i was fat i was just a slightly chubby kid and she would always remind me of how she would cry herself to sleep because of me i never did anything mean to her i was little and didnt know how to control my emotions so i would often yell back and it would be an argument anyways when i was my mom started doing this thing where she would tell me that she would pack her bags and leave back to europe by the next morning that is terrifying to hear at that age because my mom is my primary caregiver i only see my dad weekends out of the that are in a month she would tell me that she was abandoning me after any little thing i did i dropped a mug when putting away dishes and it chipped a little bit and she told me she was gonna leave my mom has also been an alcoholic her whole life she drank during the pregnancy of her first child miscarriage and drank during her pregnancy with me she is scary when shes drunk she is x more verbally abusive and i sometimes have visions of her hitting me i dont think she would ever hit me but im not sure she also used to force me to sleep with her she made me sleep with her until i was like or then she would get mad and start screaming at me and saying how i hate her just because i wanted to sleep in my own bed my mom would also always want to see me naked anytime i would shower from the ages of puberty she would tell me to get naked infront of her so she could inspect if i showered properly which would result in her checking everywhere even my private parts she still asks me at my age of if she can come help me shower when i tell her no she always pulls the why do you hate me so much card the christmas of i was our tradition is to put up the christmas tree in the morning and then open gifts that night after supper anyways after we put the tree up i went and sat down at the kitchen table and picked up my phone to just relax a little bit my mom walked by and she went on a rant about how im always on my phone and then she said something ill never forget she told me this you are not the daughter i wanted i wish i never had you anytime i bring this up she tells me im lying and that she never said it when i literally have the date written down in my notes of when she said it i know this is long so ill just list off the other things she does she still spanks me in a joking way in public after me asking her and telling her countless times to stop she punishes me by not buying me groceries like if i dont get a chore done before she gets home shell go then i guess you dont get any groceries then i am in the beginning of the process of getting a lawyer and taking my mom to court so i can live with my dad id like some advice and some tips on how to deal with this thank you for listening to me,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i hate my dad and i dont even know where to start on the reasons why i hate him i hate him i hate him he is the number one reason to every negative feeling i have and it seems like he cant stand me being happy so he has to ruin it i financially depend on him because im and the minimum wage of my country isnt enough to rent a flat plus im being paid less than minimum wage because no one else wanted to hire an unexperienced transgender teenager so im stuck on small gigs that can barely afford my lunch i dont think i can stand being alive in the same world as him one of us has to die and if he is not dying then i will i will keep trying to kill myself until his death im tired of being alive and wasting my days because he keeps hurting me and the police doesnt do anything because he doesnt hurt physically yea sure sure he never beat me but he insulted me of every word possible tried to disappear with objects to make me think im going crazy says things and then when i cry about it he says that he didnt said anything and that im making things up because im an attention seeker he forces me to do things and then call me ungrateful for not enjoying them the list goes on and on forever i will keep trying to die until i either succefully finish it or until he dies by himself,Positive

i f have a somewhat distant relationship with my parents im trans live in another city and am polyamorous which they dont yet know and undiagnosed but probably autistic which is its own can of worms i was recently lectured by my father m about why hes suddenly stopped accepting me as trans again i came out seven years ago and he initially came around to it and my mum f remains supportive just worries about my physical safety one of the arguments he tried to make really irked me he said i now need to detransition because he is finding it hard to accept that when i get into a relationship it needs to be with a cis woman because that was the idea hes had for me since i was born my mum wants me to move back to their town because shes struggling with the distance they said i need to live life for others and that means that sometimes i need to sacrifice my own happiness if i do not do these things this will be seen as a selfish act on my part my father has also threatened me with the idea that im causing them to want to split up and that my mum might kill herself if that happens as shes around menopause age and thus i need to be careful with her i can thankfully see this for what it is emotional blackmail i used to struggle with selfharm and suicidal ideation myself and i wouldnt even dream of using my mental health as leverage in an argument surely my parents relationship with each other is their responsibility not mine im a sensible person i understand when sacrifices actually need to happen i plan things out and make sure i have a safety net i am completely independent and stable financially and havent so much as gone to my parents for advice in about a decade but the sacrifices theyre asking for are the things that are making me happy in life id love to be closer to these people but i feel more hurt every time we meet i genuinely cant even confidently say i love them any more im just terrified of the fallout they threaten me with its making me miserable honestly its been this way for years is this abuse how can i communicate to them that im my own person and that i cant just throw away my relationships just to make it easier for them to deal with tldr parents want me to make enormous changes to my life because they find it hard to deal with framing my decisions as selfishness i want to know whether this is considered abusive and to communicate that i can no longer tolerate this,Positive

disclaimer i have depression and anxiety that stems from my fathers constant emotional abuse as a child this is all from my point of view and i really hope its not misunderstood im not delusional so my dad and i have never had the best relationship ever since my parents divorce he comes from a lot of generational trauma and sometimes that would carry over onto my sisters and i i always tried to impress him and tried to be the perfect child i was the like his counsellor as a child his emotional punching bag in a way of words hed often tell me that he was more harsh on me since i reminded him of my mom eventually as i grew up i couldnt stand it and slipped deeper into my depression i ran away from him in a sense i guess sorry dont want to go into the details i went to go live with my mom and it was great to be honest but eventually my mom slipped back into her substance abuse i retreated back to my dads since i mentally was doing a lot worse it was fine we fought quite a lot and didnt get along but eventually i tried to just keep my opinions to myself now back to the main issue i fought with my dad again hes always talking about my weight and usually i can ignore it but i couldnt this time and snapped i said a lot of horrible words like swearing off and telling him to go away but he began to follow me and yell he had that crazy look in his eye that ive always been scared of and we kept arguing and he started to say that hell smash my head into the ground if i dont stop talking saying he picked me up and he can take me out i was obviously upset and to be honest i wouldnt put it past him if he did do the things he was threatening me with since he has a history of abusing women in the past and with the one off occasion with my step mom he finally left me and i started crying on the porch my step brother saw me and i asked for a hug and explained he threatened to hurt me i later told my sister and she just said she didnt know what to say i spent the next couple of days avoiding him because i was scared i started to plan on how to move out but ive never lived somewhere without my parents so im terrified i thought eventually hed come apologize like he usually does since i thought he went to far but he never did until tonight days after the fight he told me i was mentally deranged and that me going around the house complaining about him was wrong that everyone thought i was strange and mentally unwell that what i was doing was wrong am i going insane am i the one in the wrong im so scared that hes right and that my sister hates me i dont know what to do if anyone has any advice or can put their two cents in id greatly appreciate it i cant go to my sister anymore since i have reason to believe she is fed up with me thank you for reading,Neutral
hi my f boyfriend m is allowing me to make this post in search of advice on what to dolegal advice because his parents are forcing him to play soccer my boyfriend has been playing soccer since he was about or and has been in both club and school teams for his entire life he used to enjoy the sport but even in the beginning his father would berate him force him to practice for hours in the morning and then hours at night his father had also physically and verbally abused him when my boyfriend was or and the physical abuse stopped a little before the age of all of the subsequent emotional and verbal abuse since then has been to call my boyfriend a failure an underachiever a loser etc even though he is one of the top players on his club team but even if he were one of the worst its still no excuse in the past year my boyfriend has suffered two major injuries an almost completely torn through ligament in his leg and a torn shoulder ligament both of which required massive surgeries with the longest healing time lasting months and weeks upon weeks of physical therapy despite this factor and a major depressive episode lasting months my boyfriends father forces him to practice soccer for hours in the morning most days and sometimes still more hours at night despite some residual pain in his knee and shoulder this is taking a large mental health toll on my boyfriend and he is visiting with a psychiatrist at least once a week for therapy appointments recently he has expressed to his parents that he wishes to quit soccer and desires to do things he actually likes my boyfriend has expressed to me that he believes he may have actually liked soccer if his father hadnt completely sucked the joy out of the sport despite this request to quit soccer his parents are continually forcing him to go to soccer college camps and compete in them this is making him depressed and anxious they complied for maybe a week before just yesterday manipulating him into saying yes his mother said he was selfish and a failure and that he is throwing away his natural talent they continue to taunt him and use me as a reason he is weak minded and a failure which is not true as a i would support him whether he wanted to play soccer or not oh and i forgot to mention they complied until the very night before he would have to leave for a two day long camp that is three states away he officially left about or hours ago because of my boyfriends mental health he has gotten resources from a mental health hospital but has never had to have had a visit there no shame if he did anyways but his mother has coerced him into going to the soccer camp by threatening that she would send him to inpatient for five days my boyfriend did not threaten self harm or suicide or anything that he would have to be sent away for she simply threatened it unprovoked because he didnt want to play soccer he is constantly being taunted by his father about soccer and his mother who is not innocent is complacent in everything and is allowing him to be abused in this manner she has told him from when he was little to hide the bruises his father gave him and has never really offered him a true feeling of safety with her even though she never laid a hand on him i believe her actions are deplorable and her and his father need to be held accountable the thing is though cps already knows about the abuse he endured as a child but is there something he can do about the threatening to send him to a mental hospital if he doesnt play soccer and would that be through cps if need be i feel like this situation is very specific and im trying to google how to do this but i feel like it might be good to find help from people who have maybe gone through something similar i also believe the forcing him to do a physical sport is a form of physical abuse and has to be acknowledged this has been going on for as long as he can remember and ive been dealing with this with him since three years ago when we started dating id also like to state that the verbal and emotional abuse doesnt just start and end with soccer but applies to every other corner of his life what can i do to help him and what can he do to help himself legal or general advice appreciated,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom has always been good to me she never hurt me but shes always been a little strange as a kid i had the normal weird humor of any kid and my mom would joke like that etc but now im genuinely bothered by what happened so im at my aunts new apartment to shower because my hot water heater broke and we are looking for someone to install the new one and im sitting down in a chair playing on my phone and then my mom just walked over and sat on my lap now something to know is that ive dealt with sexual assault in the past so im very uncomfortable with some physical touch and stuff like that and she even told me shed stop her normal jokes playfully spanking me ever so often but hasnt anyways i told her dude its way too hot for this and she just laughed i almost slipped and said dude its way to fucking hot get off but i didnt anyways she wouldnt get up until i finally said fuck it and just shoved her off i dont know if its just normal teasing or not but its been bothering the hell out of me plus just me being paranoid im sure anytime i date a girl my mom will always find something to judge them by oh she seems like shes trying to hurt you and oh you havent even met her how do you know she isnt bad etc she always finds the slightest detail and tries to pry us apart another thing is she often touches me somewhat inappropriately excuse my language but it otherwise sounds childish she will randomly slap or pinch my ass and ive told her to cut the shit she said she would she doesnt i have had to slap the back of her hand away because she would keep doing it and its not bothering me a lot,Positive
there is no physical abuse but my mother is being a real control freak threatening my sis f with religion everything she does is based on religion corrupting my sisters view on reality and life other kinds of psychological abuse for example she just shouted at my sister shes useless because she didnt want to read a religious book this happens all the time always shouting and she has literally turned my sister into a monster too they always scream at each other always because mom tries to control everything about my sis she is the reason my sister is behind with everything compared to her peers socially and academically she still acts like a year old because she is being treated like a year old she doesnt even want to let my sister go to school not because she wants to homeschool her because she doesnt think it should happen she would rather raised my sis closed up in the house become a saint or whatever its like those cult movies you see she sis never gets acknowledged respected listened to and even when she does she is bombarded with god god afterlife sins devil god im scared she will grow to be obsessive paranoid anxious and ostracized by others she is already showing signs scared that god will punish her with every wrong thing she does shes anxious and paranoid she always has stomach aches never eats shes so thin and weak also bullied at school she can never fit in and this is moms fault i know what its like not to fit in but in this case its mostly my moms fault to turn my sis into this person she is its like a mini version of her the bad part about this is she still is by moms side mom has brainwashed her she slowly starts to rebel by not wanting to read the books but shes still by moms side a lot thats all shes known her entire life i really want to get her out of this but theres nothing i can do im f and we live the of us dads kind of out of the picture i mean not really but mom and dad are already separated almost for this exact reason dad cant be an option to take us in i wouldnt want that either all my moms side of the family could do is maybe talk to her but they would probably support my mom even if they didnt theres nothing they can do but theyre still all better thsn her idk thats it ig i just want her to grow to be a healthy individual,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mom keeps touching me inappropriately and when i confront her about it she just laughs and tells me to not take it personally i dont know what to do i feel like sht and i feel like its all my fault or idk but she taught me to always take the blame and suck it up even when i was not at fault now everything i do i cant go without feeling bad because i made another mistake i dont even know anymore my life is fued,Neutral

i know its kinda selfish but ive gone through this crap for years and im so sick of it shes angered easily but a few minutes later will be totally fine she gets upset at simple mistakes i understand she has a lot of pressure on her shoulders but her outburst get more and more disturbing leading to outcomes worthy of a call or two to cps she acts like a child getting upset when things arent the way she thinks they should be i hate how she pushes this narrative that family should always come first which is good logic but not in this case i lost love for her a long time ago so much so that im unable to feel actual affection towards her shes very racist but she doesnt see it that way and very homophobic again she doesnt think that but when my brother came out as gay she started talking crap she also pushes everyone away then says everyone is fake and put to get her i cant wait til i can move out and dump her into a retirement home and let her rot for the rest of her days,Neutral
so trigger warning talks about physical abuse i grew up in a brown household and am the firstonly daughter my mother was emotionally blackmailed into marrying my father by her parents and ive known this since i was a child they had me a year into their marriage and ive always known that she never really wanted to marry him now i understand what happened to her was wrong except shes chill with her family and has physically and mentally abused me and my siblings all of our lives my father has also been physically abusive occasionally and gaslights manipulates us but i know that he truly loves me and would do anything for me except i cant trust men my maternal grandfather passed away before my mothers wedding but he was the one who had initially started with the blackmailing because he had given her everything she wanted her entire life and in return she should listen to him she doesnt think he was in the wrong and that he was caring i hate him because i could never imagine taking my childs rights to decide for themselves everyone around me constantly praises him and i hate it ive never been able to truly trust my father because of this and have grown into a very defensive person i dont like people taking control of my life so growing up i would constantly try to draw a boundary growing up i never saw a healthy loving relationship between my parents in fact i was the one who had mediate their fights i would standup for my mother whereas her only family members would make fun of how they forced her but in the end they were the ones she loves it infuriates me because i consider them traitors i cant be nice to them because im always reminded of their shitty behavior especialy since they still make insensitive jokes and never take blame even though they do send me gifts and try to be affectionate i cant show affection to them now im at a point where ive started financially earning but i cant move out because i have to pay for my university and its against our culture i live in an asian country and tbh im not making enough im trying to change and get rid of the toxic traits that i have in me im very loud because ive always had to scream just to be heard and i wanna get rid of this and i curse a lot but ive realised its because my mother used to curse a lot and ive never been in any romantic relationships not even close because ive completely closed myself off im very emotional when it comes to my friends but im scared that i cant open up like that or my partner will use it against me its like even if i get out of this house the effects will always stay there everytime i start a new relationship what my parents did to me will stop it from evolving into anything good it took a long time for me to emotionally open up to friends but even now i get scared that im a nuisance to them and my parents keep gaslighting me and telling me that theyve never abused me it took me ages to get rid of the shame i felt as though i was in the wrong and that it was embarrassing to have parents who abuse me its so scary because they say that they did it with good intentions but they cant see that it ruined me i feel so broken and i dont know i just need to know that theres hope and that someone out there has survived and learnt and actually become a new person,Neutral
hey this will be my first and probably only post on reddit i just needed somewhere to get it out of my mind and off my chest both of my parents suck and i dont have somewhere else to go my biological father is a monster hes diagnosed with schizophrenia and dependent personality disorder hes not a monster because of these diagnoses hes had many wrongs in his lifetime and a lot of trauma i did not know about the schizophrenia diagnosis until just this week when his ex gf reached out to me to discuss she was worried and wanted to let me know if i had t been aware and offer resources with the journey his mother my grandmother is a hoarder her house cant be lived in and has been unsafe since i visited for the summer in the s she and my father are horrifically codependent the doctors had to tell her that my father is a grown man and can take carw of himself at the hospital shes outright a narcissist i recall multiple instances where shes going off on my disabled brother for not doing everything to her standards and i jump in to defend him i had to write a handwritten apology because this fucking year old woman got so asshurt that a year old told her to back the fuck off that she stopped showing up to bring food for a month she verbally berates everyone ive had to apologize in public when she goes off on racist rants and in one specific instance i had to call insurance when she keyed another familys car when i was ive cut all contact with her shes the first person ive ever had to do that with she ran the house like it was the military my father is comparatively nicer he has moments where it feels lucid like hes an actual person with feelings but thats only of the time i have vivid memories of chatting with him happily before doing homework and then getting verbally berated only minutes later because i wasnt following his directions to an exact my earliest childhood memory of him was an argument about table manners my brother did not like to bring the fork to his face instead he leaned down to eat and it into him hitting my yo brother and shoving him into the closet door i was too young to process it happening to the degree i know it now just that it felt deeply wrong to witness and something about it was innately backwards i got diagnosed with adhd when i was very young in first grade actually and when my mother told him about the medication i would need to be on he pulled over and walked out of the car yelling that he would never have a kid with r slur here issues hes always spoken to me like im deficient its always felt like i had to do something to earn praise from him currently i am in my s and out of a job i planned to be in college at this point in my life but i cant afford it because the early savings account that we as a family set up got drained for his goddamn mother to fill her house with more useless clothes the parents i live with my mother and stepfather yell at me constantly about getting a job but i keep failing interviews and i dont have enough experience in the field i want to work in because of aforementioned college fund disappearing magically they charge me ridiculous rent that by now has been piling up despite my mother previously promising that she would never do that they will not listen to me when i try to explain that it feels like im just now trying to do the whole growing process again my stepfather has been trying to step in as a father figure which i appreciate i think families are going to be difficult even in healthy nonabusive ones but hes oscillating between threatening to kick me out if i dont get a job in the next few months and saying its out of love i dont know how to feel about it without outright having a panic attack i think im just far too gone to have a proper parental figure suddenly try to introduce themselves and be a part of my life my mother is bordering alcoholism i think its a hereditary thing in the family and my grandfather on her side started this pattern similarly a month ago i had to stay up until am to make sure she got home safe after repeated nights out of drinking and getting high with her friends shes easily impressionable and fell into a bunch of racist conspiracies and homophobia during the lockdown shes a bisexual woman i am a nonbinary lesbian i dont understand how it happened she makes me feel lost it beats the hell that my biological father has raised though dont get me wrong heres the catch i have further job opportunities in the city my biological father lives in but i cant live with him under any circumstances hes had psychotic episodes as recently as despite his treatment for it i just feel defeated and hollow it gets better i know it does i just never knew just how bad everything i didnt know prior to this discovery was i loved my father and wanted to move in before knowing this im at the point where my brothers and my dog and the potential of things suddenly turning around is the only thing keeping me going if i didnt have my dog i dont know what i would do i would like to forgive my parents as long as everything changes but i currently have no faith in it i just dont know what its like having a loving family thank you dad you ruined my fucking life before it even got a chance to start thank you mom for repeatedly acknowledging issues but not solving them,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i fm just got disciplined like i was my dad got upset because my brother was talking with a slightly raised voice and came out into our living room and started lashing out on us he hit me in the face and scolded me and i fell and then threatened to punch my brother no one said or did anything to antagonize him he just got extremely irate and yesterday he threw his office chair across his office and almost broke it in half and the night before that he snapped his controller in half out of pure rage im absolutely terrified of him and how aggressive he is i feel like im walking on eggshells around him and its genuinely sad he never got caught treating his whole family like this for as long as hes had us,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i f am home for the summer from my freshman year of college my parents are not very good at maintaining my privacy and especially like to come into my room unannounced or without asking for the past serveral years my father almost only ever talks to me when it is to tell me to clean the house do schoolwork or something church related they are active mormons i dont believe but have to pretend i do to keep them happy today is my moms birthday several times this summer my father will tell my mother that me and him will do the dishes and clean up after dinner because she worked so hard on cooking it really bugs me when he volunteers me to do work i dont mind cleaning up but i really value my automomy and he rarely ever actually helps too he did so today and i admittedly made a face when he said he and i would clean up after dinner he proceeded to get really offended and get really upset that i wasnt willing to even do this one thing on my mothers birthday ive tried talking to him before about how i feel his love is conditional to how much work i do for him and he laughed he said i didnt mean it and i knew he loved me but he only talks to me to tell me to work and its been going on for years the problem really isnt the cleaning its that every time i bring up how he talks to me solely about things i need to do for him he gets mad and defensive he often also starts listing all the ways he financially supports me which makes me feel guilty i always end up apologizing feeling like im in the wrong and entitled and wishing i had just kept my head down and done the work without comment am i entitled is he just bad at parenting or is this emotionally abusive i really cant tell if im in the wrong for being so hurt about this,Positive
my parents dont think im capable of raising my children on my own im deaf and have chronic illnesses yes but i also have a supportive partner were engaged my partner is capable of supporting us and is fine with renting a place where my kids can live under our roof he has taken my kids out to do stuff when i cant like ice skating driving them around etc however my parents are forcing me to stay here in their house the irony of the situation is that my ex is trying for the same reasons to force the kids to move back in with him and they dont want to i have told the kids repeatedly that i will respect their wishes in this matter if they preferred to be at their dads i would support their decision if they prefer to stay with my parents im fine with that too although we would still rent a place with space for them so they could come and go as they pleased but my parents are saying that im not a good parent im not capable of parenting on my own although i wouldnt be on my own when i am feeling unwell my partner would step up and if they were under my roof i would of course push myself to play an active role i am very depressed living here i hole up in my bedroom which is the same thing my middle child does at her dads for the same reason its not that i dont get along with my parents its that they constantly treat me like a child and then complain when i act like one for the record i have tried very hard to be more of an adult around them but living under their roof causes me to fall back into toxic behavior patterns my body reacts to the stress so im in pain a lot and my mental health is suffering i was trying to endure it because i thought that when the school year began my partner and i would live together in a place of our own so while i was never happy exactly i was trying to maintain a facade of normality now they are telling me that i must only visit my partner but remain here they keep saying that its for the sake of the kids but i am not doing well here and once they said that i immediately lost all motivation to even attempt to be stable im severely depressed and having trouble taking care of myself i know things would not be like this with my partner because weve had long periods of cohabitation and i was much more functional despite various health issues that have cropped up recently i was motivated to get out of bed and take care of myself now that is gone i dont understand how they can possibly think this is good for the children i will never be physically well but when you add severe depression into the mix the result is very bad how can i get them to understand that i want to be free i dont think i will live to be old and i want at least a few years of living apart from them they dont seem to understand that this is driving a wedge between us and that when the kids have graduated i intend to move to alaska full time and go lowcontact as a result of this it feels like a prison a nice one yes but theres a poisonous lack of freedom that is causing me to suffer,Positive
i am a f and i have no longer the joy to live i have abusive parents and i dont know if i should endure it till i become or run away to give you and example when i was two boys almost the same age took my toy and mocked me like any kid i went complain to my dad and he said grow up i havent time for this in an anoyed way i insisted cuz it was my fav toy and he got mad and yeeted me back to the sandbox hurting my back when i was i received a fake bird that could fly i asked my parents if when can we go outside so i can play with it they said later and i agreed i waited and days later i asked again my mom snapped with anger for an unknown reason and said break that shit its getting on my nerve my dad her slave as always did it and i was holding my tears up so that my sis doesnt see me crying she was but the worst was at we were in morocco to visit family and me and my cousin where alone with my uncle and he brought us to a strip club and the owner looked at us with a disturbing grin and he and my uncle talked he payed my uncle and my uncle said to us go to the room and wait i will get drink spoiler alert drinks never came but other things yes a guy came in and he started looking at my cousin forgot to tell my uncle had told us to only wear shorts and tight shirts he started to approach my cousin and touched her in inappropriate ways my blood was boiling cuz she was the only one nice to me when he tossed her shorts off while her screaming to not and trying to fight back something snapped in me i remembered my multi gadget had a knife and before i know it he had three holes in the chest and my knife was dirty with this man blood i was panicking but hopefully my cousin made us leave by the emergency exit that wasnt even the last straw my uncle is a pedo and he tried to grop us countless times but every fucking time i complained my parents says you are probably miss interpreted him that how he show loveor hes family and its your fault cover up he even kiss me in the lips multiple times now what doi say to my futer kids oh yeah my first kiss was taken by my uncle i feel like throwing up remembering this and knowing i have no power against it today my parents made us change country again without telling us so no goodbyes to my friends or having a last hang out no for the th time its been a year since i am in this country but they want to change again and that would mess up my studies cuz not all countries have the same education system and diploma they even make all the chores on me cleaning cooking even the lunchboxes for my parents not that it bothers me but they only call me names not even thanks or a smile babysitting my siblings in summer so almost no time to go out except after pm and for a good reason therapist and even if i always talk calmy and nicely they find a reason to snap have to be perfect gradespersonalitieshave a good knowledge and etc so they can flex bank they take my allowance or money from my parttime job my siblings literally come to me first cuz i am the responsible to the point that i dont even see my siblings as siblings but as my kids they always argue honestly i hoped they never married they always call me names never my name to the point that if you call me by my name i will get weird out the only thing stopping me from running away are my siblings but should i or wait till i became or end it all,Neutral

i am f and have immigrant parents who are f and m throughout my childhood my mom has been a constant source of hate and anger but i am writing this post because i genuinely do not know if this counts as abuse especially since we are brown and so a lot of this behavior is common in brown households so im gonna give a little insight on some things my mom has done to me while i was under the age of although i dont remember around of the things shes done to me while she somehow remebrs every bad thing ive done so in elementary she took acedmics very seriously and every single day she would make me do extra practice work that would take hours to do and would be above my grade level many many times while doing above grade level ixl with her if i got a question wrong she would take the ipad i was doing it on and hit me repatidly with it on my head also she would scream and scream till i was crying if i made any mistakes one time when i was around so in first grade i got a question wrong and she took a pencil and stabbed my arm with it which made my arm start bleeding also several times if i did something wrong she would grab me by my hair and would drag me across the floor just by my hair which was incredibly painful and scary also when i was around nd grade she would take a cooking tool similar to a wooden rolling pin and would hit me with it which hurts like hell because its huge and wooden throught my childhood if i did anything wrong she would hit me and i would actually be happy if she used her shoes to hit me because they didnt hurt as much also a few times she got so angry that she grabbed onto my arms and clawed at me to the point where my arms were bleeding theese are just a few creative methods shes used to hit my but often she would just slap me despite all this what she did to me phycally wasnt nearly as bad as mentally so ever since i was a little kid my mom can not speak to me or treat me like a normal human being let alone her daughter whenever i ask her a simple question she snaps at me and never speaks in a normal tone this obviously makes me reluctant to talk to her and when i still do our conversations always end in agrumnets she is extremely easy to upset and when she does get angry she spends hours whispering to her self while cooking or upstairs about all the horrible things she wishes would happen to me or my family i can not recall everything she says and she speaks in our native language so its difficult to translate but she usually says something along the lines of how much she wishes we were dead all the truly disgusting and sinister ways she would kill us for emapmple my stomping my head in or kicking and rolling me around and spitting on me or murdering me or kicking me out of the house to live with street dogs all the examples ive just given are extremely tame versions of what she says her whisperings are very graphic and detailed and they make my stomach turn i dont understand how someone can whish such disgusting horrific things on their own children when most people wouldnt wish it on there worst enemy her whispering that she does is still pretty loud so everyone can hear her and its basically her trying to curse us or wish for the worst most gruesome violent things to happen to us she does this several times a day and does this for very very small things theres a lot more insane things shes done this is the tip of the ice berg,Positive
so my mom and her boyfriend have been together for about years now and for all ten years theyve argued with each other usually its just an argument about something stupid and nine times out of ten my moms boyfriend is the one to start the argument my mom is a very calm and peaceful person who hates confrontation so she usually tries to walk away from the argument but that only pisses off her boyfriend sometimes to the point where he hits her or puts his hands around her neck now my mom wants to move on and he refuses to leave literally just ten minutes before typing this we nearly had to call the police on him because he kept grabbing her by the arms and not letting her leave the situation and he also put his hands around her neck again my mom isnt the only one he has put his hands on though he has tried to choke me and he has hit my brother i dont hate the guy but he needs mental help for whatever reason he doesnt see any of this as wrong there have been nice times with him but for the most part ive been stressed out over these past ten years im and i dont have the money to move out all i want is some sense of peace for a bit ive spent a large chunk of my childhood stressed out and scared,Positive
so the police found out about my dad and the thing is it isnt that bad but the court case cost around k and we dont have that money i wanna go surfing but i had to sell my surfboard to give my dad the money to go even though he is an abuser he still is my dad and im scared he blames me for everything,Neutral
so i do want to get too into it because the story with my mother is decades long but curious about an outside perspective on my relationship with her currently my mother is homelesson the verge of homeless its been like this for the past years shes made no effort in the past years to get a long term stable job and unfortunately has just squandered away and money she comes across to afford any kind of living situation however with no job this money goes by quick we seem to be on an every months cycle where she texts me asking for more money because she is again about to be homeless this has happened at least times in the past years she claims her various illnesses are what is preventing her from finding a job yet she doesnt take care of herself and is letting these health issues be an excuse for why everything in her life is going wrong and not her fault yesterday i get news that our families dog who unfortunately has been with her in these tumultuous times needed to be put down she was years old black lab she got sick out of the blue and i believe this to be a lack of care from my mother to our dog i just finished college hence why i have not been taking care of the family dog i also suggested that although painful to give up this animal it would be best for her to have a family that could properly take care of her regardless because of a lack of funds on her end i just paid for all the blood work the did on the dog and her euthenization im glad our dog is not in pain anymore but extremely distraught that this situation even had to happen she is again after this just happening yesterday asking me for to pay for her hotel shes been staying at i just cant keep throwing money at her knowing it will never come back i am currently supporting myself and my younger brother as well i always feel guilty for saying no to her but after years of this and an unstable childhood i just cant do it anymore i guess curious if anyone has dealt with a parent like this and what they did to cope tldr my mother has been homeless for years constantly asks me for money to avoid eviction she blames health issues for not working but neglects her own care recently had to put down our dog due to her negligence costing me now she wants for a hotel im supporting myself and my brother and cant keep funding her irresponsibility wondering how others cope with similar situations,Positive
this is gonna need some background information so im sorry the post is so long my f boyfriend m and his sister f grew up in a dysfunctional family in which they were fed and given shelter but neglected in terms of emotional neglect exposed to parents arguments and personal issues no family time ignoring mental health educational neglect allowed him to drop out of school made no efforts to encourage study environmental neglect unsanitary surroundings and food handling holes in floors and walls not being fixed not being fed a balanced or healthy diet not having a hygienic environment not taught or encouraged to get a job or higher education how to write a resume essentially most basic skills parents would teach their teensyoung adults losingnot giving him his important documents like birth certificate that he needed in order to get a provisional license passport etc as well as neglect his father is frequently in and out of a job due to him not showing up and so they have him and his sister give them money to buy large amounts of cigarettes they struggle financially already and his sister is also in debt due to this my boyfriend is also diagnosed with asd which impacts his ability to get hired discrimination sensory and social issues as a result of all this he and his sister are reliant on staying with their parents and are not yet able to move out this has created a very depressing solitary environment for my boyfriend as often nobody is awake in the daytime they do not interact unless to ask for money or dump their emotional load onto him and he is held back from pursuing a happy and fulfilled adult life onto what the title says their mother f is diagnosed with schizophrenia which can largely influence her behaviour she regularly refuses to take her medication and as a result will act aggressively say harmful things make unwise financial decisions and they dont know what they can actually do as she is an adult and when they have had to dial did not receive adequate help as their father refuses to step up my boyfriend and his sister take the brunt of this and have to regularly walk on eggshells and act as her caretakers my boyfriend is afraid of leaving home for too long as she has expressed suicidal intent before made threats and he feels personally responsible for her he isnt sure if he can contact social services or if anything exists that would help him to develop skills and find workbecome selfsustaining as an autistic adult which drives him to feeling hopeless and at times suicidal i wanted to ask the adult adults of reddit what can he and his sister actually do in this situation to become independent are there resources available in the uk for this niche situation it pains me seeing him so hopeless he is an incredibly intelligent selfless and capable person who deserves to begin his own life and thrive tldr my boyfriend and his sister were neglected and abused growing up and are struggling to move out for a multitude of reasons boyfriend struggles with autism sister in debt because of parents feeling responsible for mothers mental health and providing for their parents as adults what services or support is available to help my boyfriend and his sister become independent and break free from this toxic household,Positive
i f am living at home with my parents m and f when i was younger they were extremely physically and mentally abusive my dad once threw me into a windowsill and knocked me out for being too loud while my friend was over my mom called me a slut and said i looked terrible when my friend did my makeup they say i did not experience a difficult childhood even though we were dirt poor and ive been abused my whole life now for the most part the physical abuse has stopped beyond certain occasions but now they are set to ruin my life i want to go to college to become a vet but they are keeping me trapped here i got into siu carbondale paid for housing registered for classes put in my notice at work everything all i asked them to do was fill out the fafsa so i could get a loan this caused them to take my car to the junkyard refuse to sign anything and scream at me for hours i have done everything i can i tried to get a private loan but was denied because i dont have a cosigner i will never find one i cannot get federal aid without them signing a fafsa refusal letter and i have no way to pay out of pocket i told them i will commit suicide if they dont do this for me and they laughed in my face they do not care about me they just want to leech off of me forever im out of options they have beat me i am seriously considering suicide now because if i cant build a future for myself whats the point i said this to my dad and he agreed i should do it i cant run away i have nowhere to go ive tried everything to get a loan its impossible if you have any advice please let me know i could use anything,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
tw i talk about suicide and self harm ps i dont think my parents are abusive but i thought it somewhat fit the subject something i just realized is that i think my parents have really messed me up to the point that i dont know what to expect from people anymore i dont know how to expect being treated and i feel like i cant expect that people are there for me because everyone i have ever talked to about the stuff my parents did to me have just said that humans cant bearent perfect i was struggling with intrusive thoughts about killing my little sister i have severe ocd i had struggled every day every single second for a year i stopped liking what i used to like like dancing and i struggled to the point where i couldnt even take care of myself and do basic stuff like shower i walked upstairs to my mom while crying then i asked her to talk to me and come downstairs which i only agreed to after my dad persuaded me to talk to her we got downstairs and she looked at me with a cold face as i sat there crying and sobbing from being terrified and exhausted and she told me why dont you just do it then when i finally tried to kill myself my dad told me that she had said that she felt nothing my dad didnt mean it as a bad thing he thought it was because she was just tired so he said it to me because he thought itd show that she really did love me on the night that i killed myself my mom and dad left me alone at the hospital i was laying there alone devastated and sobbing in the dark for the entire night the one time that night when i tried to call my parents they both got mad because they wanted to sleep and then they hung up i once asked my mom if she loved me because i wasnt sure if she did anymore she said yes but based off of her emotionless tone that was a lie she also didnt say anything more just that simple word yes i know my mom when she did love me when i was younger she wouldve gotten sad that i believed she didnt but now all i was met with was an emotionless voice saying the word yes mechanically when i had tried to kill myself a second time by cutting i eventually gave up and called my dad as i had to get to the doctor to possibly get stitched up and after i had explained the situation to him all he did was complain that he had to drive me to the doctor and so i had to take the bus which is okay im just sad that he didnt care at all when my mom later saw that i had cut myself she didnt react at all she was still as happy and just kept talking like it didnt matter at all one time my dad and i talked and he said that if i ever died he doesnt know if hed cry he has this thing where he doesnt think hes generally able to cry though the things my parents have done to me and the fact that they werent there for me when i needed them the most has created an emotional wound in me that i will have to carry for the rest of my life i look back at the pictures of me and my parents from when i was a kid and even though they are alive it feels like i have lost them like they are gone my mom and my dad who i felt safe with who said that theyd always love me and that nothing i could do would ever change that they arent here anymore and if it could even get any worse i now also dont know what to expect from people when i was only and needed my parents the two people who were supposed to protect me when i was so mentally unwell and so devastated exhausted sad and in need of support and help they werent there instead they started doing and saying some of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me and everyone ive ever told about these things always tells me well your parents probably does love you and that humans are not perfect i just read somewhere about a girl who had had a really bad day as she struggled with her mental health she had talked to her boyfriend about thoughts she was having about self harm and that she was really struggling later that day when they went to bed he asked to have sex with her she wasnt in the mood at all but said yes while they were having sex she suddenly started bleeding from her nose he told her that he could just throw a towel over it and then she could finish off she said that she wasnt in the mood anymore and started crying as she had had a really bad day and were struggling and she was sitting there explaining to him that she wasnt in the mood much in the first place but as shes talking to him he stops her mid sentence and tells her that she put him in a weird position here because he needed to jack off to be able to sleep then he pulled up his phone to watch porn and jack off next to his crying bleeding girlfriend to all of this i thought well i feel bad for her that was not an ideal reaction from him but humans arent perfect that was my reaction it wasnt until after i started reading what others had to say about it that i started realizing how bad he was really treating her and that it wasnt okay now i am genuinely concerned about myself on top of the fact that i have lost my parents and that my mom doesnt love me anymore all of this also seems to have affected me in the way that i dont know what is normal and what is not i dont know what to expect from people or how i should expect that they treat me how can i know when someone is going too far and treating me badly how can i know what is okay and what is not even when i read about what ive written here and about the things my parents have said and done i dont know if i am overreacting and that maybe i am expecting too much from them i dont know all of it feels really hurtful and some part of me thinks it maybe isnt okay but the other part of me remembers that humans arent perfect after all just like everyone has told me all i know is that i clearly have issues with knowing what is okay and what is not and i need to learn myself what is normal behavior from people and what i can expect from them so that i dont get abused or end up in bad situations where should i start and what do i do if anyone has any advice then id love to hear thank you so much for reading,Positive

my step dad has almost a hatred for me and i dont know why he treats me and my brothers so differently it makes me feel like an outcast he will not talk to me unless its to give me shit for something yet he will have full conversations with both my brothers but recently i have been talking to someone and we are getting into a relationship and he all of a sudden is nice to me only when my boyfriend comes around it straight up feels like hes trying to make a good impression with my boyfriend only but hes hurt me so much i dont want anything to do with him i have told my boyfriend some of the things he has done and he knows that i dont have a relationship with him at all it makes me upset that he can only have a conversation with me when my boyfriend is here yet when hes gone he flips sides and becomes the person that shit talks me the most,Neutral

so hello everyone i am a girl residing in india and in my teens i will keep it short and simple i have been beaten up by my parents since a young age over trivial matter but recently it has become more my dad has begun to thrash me rashly so does my mom recently my dad became so angry when i asked a break from my studies that he came to my room made sure he closed all windows and doors and then took me to the dining room and thrashed the hell out of me with a cloth hanger also punched and kicked me in front of my mom and she too told nothing my thighs were all black blue with bruises and bruised stayed for more than three days he is also continuously threatening to choke and kill me because it is waste for spending money on my education verbal abuse is also to the max level please tell me whta i should do or should i keep quiet,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i am yo female weighing pounds at most i eat fast and i never go for seconds i moved out of my abusive household and into my grandparents home and they are wonderful the only thing that bothers me is grandpa keeps saying things like we eat four meals with you here its like me grandma you and you or i know youre definitely hungry when ever food is mentioned im sure you can finish off what ever left they really dont like left overs but are making way to much for three people to eat i eat just as much as him at a meal and unlike him i dont eat breakfast i dont snack and i dont eat dessert his comments are really bothering me and i truly think he thinks i am eating too much but i almost only eat one meal a day and dont always finish that meal so idk why he is being so rude he is also really pushy at trying to get me to eat any left overs i dont know how to respond but its pissing me off it doesnt help that i have been having issues with bloating and gas lately it makes me angry and i want to cry i have never had issues with them outside of this idk what to do but i told him today i dont eat that much and he basically told me i was lying and he thinks otherwise in somewhat of a joking manner at first i thought it was teasing but now i know its not besides he is probably at the least with a dad bod so i feel like he is not in a place to judge me a nearly anorexic teen that still wears smalls and mediums i dont want to be mean but i dont want to push this off cause i know it could escalate to a point that hurts me forever how do i handle it my first thought is to stop eating and leave the room when ever he does that but i feel like thats passive aggressive of me my other thought was to just stop eating like i was before i moved but that led to a lot of health problems probably why i am bloating and having a hard time digesting now that i am eating regularlyish the only thing i can think of that i do wrong when i eat is that i eat really fast growing up i just ate fast we often ate in the car headed some where or right before leaving or going to bed its always been a rush to finish our food so its really hard to eat slow ps this is not the parents of my abusive mother these are the parents of my nonabusive step father,Neutral
a lot of messed up stuff happened in my childhood definitely things that should have never happened i was always confused on whether my mom liked me or not shed say such cruel things to me and in the next breath act like were best friends shed make fun of the way i looked then copy my style shed act weird when i hang out with my stepdad and get jealous of me i never knew what was true with her and what wasnt i truly knew she didnt care about me after i told her about the weird stuff my step dad did he kept pushing taboo topics and frankly disgusting sexual ideas towards me luckily he never did anything physical to me but that didnt make it any less messed up i told my mother and she humiliated me in front of everyone then got mad at me she stayed married to that man for years after i turned and moved out it wasnt until recently she messaged me telling me that she believes what i said and is divorcing him this all happened because he was secretly drugging her since i left he also admitted to at least some of the weird stuff he said to me after that i tried to reconnect with my mother but it didnt work out she would bring up memories like they were happy occasions but i remembered it as exactly the opposite i would see old glimpses of the woman i wasnt convinced and even like me it was like she was desperately trying to pretend like everything was okay when it wasnt after all that i wonder if i could ever really forgive her or trust her im not really sure if she ever cared about me i was always her least favorite child,Positive
i dont even know if shes abusive or not but as a girl being around my own mother has affected the way i socialize with other women she neglected me when i was born and my aunt was the one who raised me she was more of a mother to me than she was anytime i talk to her she yells at me and uses verbal abuse when i try to communicate ive been told that i should respect her and that i should ignore her but how can i respect someone whos been so awful to me she acts nice to me only when she wants to be her new relationship with her boyfriend has turned her into a worse person shes obsessed and she choose him over my sister and i this hurts so much i keep hoping that my mom will change and she will become a better person and i didnt realize i had been hoping for this for years this has been such an on going loop i feel like i should hate her but i never could because shes my mom i cant even move out because i dont have a source i feel abandoned by her almost whenever i text her all she does is fight me and she blocks me i feel awful i feel desensitized towards her mistreatment towards me i dont know what to think of this,Neutral
something that makes me want to scream at people nowadays is how they think cartoons like the secret of nimh was traumatizing and they are only know realizing this or how they are so hardcore because they watched faces of death traumatizing is having your mother put on porn to watch with you at and up traumatizing is knowing if the day was going to be good or bad if she watched her brotheryour uncles crime scene video and having his corpse in a red mustang burned into your memory please start teaching your kids the difference between reality and fantasy and for the love of all that is holy and unholy please never watch porn with your kids,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i had a fight with my mom and she kicked me out told me she never wanted to see me again and many more nasty things i didnt say a word to her i have too much respect for her to say something back i picked up my bags and left i didnt want to speak to her and the first thing she asked me through my dad was if i wanted to go to disney with her not sorry not a hello not a hi nothing just if i wanted to go with her somewhere after not speaking to her for almost two months now what could that mean that her only way of saying sorry was through money i obviously said no but it hurt,Neutral
ive always felt like i was kind of weird i want to say that i felt like i was different but that would be a lie because i feel like everyone is unique so weird would be the word to describe me growing up i was surrounded by family but not in the way you might expect during those times my mom and dad would fight constantly and i tried acting very unbothered thinking it didnt affect me because i wanted to be strong my parents and i moved into a house in miami and my aunt who was in high school was living with us at the moment my aunt was very smart she was very brave for coming to miami without her mom and dad in order to get a better education here but she was constantly fighting with her dad later on my moms side of the family all came to move into our home from honduras it was chaos i felt like i was watching a war everyone fought my mom and my dad fought my mom and my aunt fought my grandpa and my grandma fought my uncle and my aunt fought it was exhausting at times and the way i would cope would be to daydream i loved to daydream it felt like i was in my own little world away from everyone it would sort of be my safe space where no one was able to touch me and where i wouldnt hear anyone my mom kicked out my grandpa and eventually everyone started to leave i sort of felt relieved but also felt alone i was always surrounded by people and even though they were fighting it was comforting to have everyone together since they were gone my parents shifted their focus onto me and my sister my mom holds a lot of anger in her and to be honest i cant blame her the things i heard about what she went through ate away at me but she was very harsh with me sometimes and i learned not to share personal things or do anything to give her a reason to yell her words cut better than any knife when i was younger i would text my friends and sometimes i would talk about my mom which was almost never and i mentioned how i thought she was scary she checked my phone one day and looked through everything and saw that i said that about her she was furious i meant no harm in saying that it was just she always yelled i was oblivious when i was in the fifth grade she screamed at me terribly i remember she asked me what are their parents going to think im abusing you am i abusing you i stopped talking about her after that i never felt like i was close with her what was the point,Neutral
so to start this fiasco i woke up one morning and immediately my abdomen was burning and felt super painful i had nothing the night before in terms of pain and no history of this ever happening theres is however a history of appendicitis in my family i tried standing up to go to the bathroom but i couldnt even stand up straight i went to my moms room and told her hey i think i need to go to the hospital her response nope wait an hour so im sitting there on the couch in pain and feeling awful and shes just sitting there pretending nothing is happening she then keeps asking me to rate my pain i keep the numbers low only because in the past when i have told her about me being in real pain she flips her shit and loses her mind she then goes on to tell me how she has a migraine and how i should pity her and just shut up and deal with it an hour later im still in pain and she angrly decides im going to go to urgent care to prove her right so while were driving to urgent care im in the back trying to stay as still as possible to minimize the pain because its really bad and she sees that and hits every speed bump possible making it so by the time we were actually at urgent care i felt even worse we get in and the doctor sees me and is immediately like yeah she should really go to the hospital like right now and my mom sends me out of the room and i can here her telling the doctor oh shes lying shes not sick just tell her she should go home and thank god the doctor stood up to her and said this isnt a game her life could really be at risk do you want that on your conscious so we drive to the hospital and the whole time shes telling me that im being so self absorbed for picking today to be sick and that im doing this to hurt her and clearly this is a psychological problem with me we get to the hospital and she watches me get checked in then fucking dips out of there she then calls my neighbor and asks her to watch over me and leaves the entire state not even joking the doctors try to figure out whats wrong they cant in the er and they tell my to schedule somthing with my primary so my neighbor brings me home to which i discovered that she left entirely and i had no food i then get a text later on that night and she rants about how her migraine was probably worse then any pain i had and then she dodges all my calls and refuses to give me a date when shell be back as for my health i dont give a shit anymore i havent taken any of the medicine and im not schedulling an appointment im pretty uncaring of my life anymore and whether i live or die so i dont care if i drop dead from this honestly i hope it happens one so i can be free of this nightmare of a life i have and so that they can finally see i wasnt faking it,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

does anyone else find themselves attaching to women older than you typically who show you any amount of care or love simple as a hug or a pat on the back then you start to think of them as mother figures wishing they were your mother instead and getting jealous of them having children because at least those kids have someone to nurture them and love them im embarrassed by it and feel like its wrong but i cant stop,Neutral

i joined this subreddit not even hours ago and i just feel so fucking defeated everything kind of just sucks and i need a place to just ramble and hopefully ill feel better in the end i dont think my sister is in this subreddit or is even aware of its existence and i really dont want to make a throwaway so if youre my sister dont read this because im not involving you in this shit show growing up my sister well call her ruth was and probably still is my dads favorite shes years older than me and was developmentally delayed to an extent ruth has auditory processing disorder which is basically like dyslexia for hearing she cant focus on one sound with a bunch of background noise so if youre talking to her in an area with a lot of noise pollution its hard for her to understand the first go around my sister was born in and the auditory processing disorder diagnosis came about in shes the oldest so my parents were freaked out when ruth wasnt developing the way a normal child with no disabilities would she couldnt hear my parents talk to her half the time so her speech was delayed before the diagnosis my parents thought she would grow up to be put in a group home for adults this never happened because they figured out the issue and there was a treatment plan in place to help her through catching up with development and help her succeed in school she turns this year and im very proud of being her brother with all the hurdles shes gone through with her auditory processing for as long as i can remember ive always felt like i wasnt good enough for my dad nothing i did was good enough even at years old and dealing with bullying from girls at school because i was born a girl transitioning when i was and i didnt fit the image of what the other girls wanted me to be i got bullied a lot for things of that nature at school and my sister also was bullied to some degree because of her disorder she was always coddled by my dad and i would get scolded there was an instance of me being a kid and doing what kids do my dad getting mad and picking me up and slamming against a closet door to yell in my face when he let me down i ran and hid in the pantry he called my mom sobbing and telling her he went too far my mom didnt know what exactly had happened until i had told her years later it didnt get better from there because around or i told my mom i wanted my dad dead i never had a good relationship with death growing up because the finality of it all scared me and still does if there were something serious that needed to be talked about i always asked first if it was about death all i knew about death at that point is that its the one thing that you cant come back from and if youre dead the person can no longer harm you and thats basically what it was i didnt describe how i wanted him dead i just wanted him dead so he wouldnt hurt me anymore terrified my mom put me and my dad in therapy and i dont really remember much about going through that it didnt fully fix things but it healed them enough that i no longer would say that i wanted him dead dont get me wrong my mom and ruth were also victims to my dads abuse i just got the worst of it all ruth got slaps in the wrist compared to me and my mom we werent raised religious parents were both lapsed in their respective faith backgrounds so ruth and i were always and still are interested in learning about different religions we learned a lot about judaism since my aunt and my cousin on my moms side are jewish from how my grandparents raised them but never a lot about christianity my dad has religious trauma from the religion and hated the notion of us even learning about god or jesus or literally anything that had to do with the religion we were unfortunately fans of a prominent christian family shown on tlc and my dad hated that we watched the show my sister had dated a boy in middle school who was catholic and my dad drilled into her about why she would want to convert to catholicism when she was thats the kind of things ruth would get meanwhile i would get yelled at if i missed a goal during a soccer game dropped a fly ball in softball made any small mistake that a kid makes etc i was constantly trying to be better for my dad and i couldnt never meet the high bar he had for me my parents divorced in but the start of it happened in when my dad was laid off from his job he fucked us over financially because he never tried to get a good job again he would get min wage jobs and get fired because he called off too much he didnt give a shit while my mom bent over backwards to make sure we survived i wont get into every detail of why he is the way he is but it boils down to hes never been allowed to hit rock bottom hes always had something there to catch him before he hits the ground during them trying to work things out and not divorce there was a time that my dad was screaming in my moms face calling her every nasty name in the book in the kitchen with me in the family room not even ft away and fully able to hear everything i was on the computer and i wanted to escape to my room but i remember thinking i couldnt because if i did my dad would bring me into the crossfires and use me against my mom in the house they bought in was foreclosed on and my mom and i moved about ish minutes to a different state and city ruth had just graduated high school and i had just finished freshman year i was furious that i was being ripped from everything i knew and blamed it on my mom when looking back its really my dads fault i was an awful kid for sophomore and junior year just very short mean and rude to my mom and i regret it every day how bad i was was also the year i went nc with my dad the first time after various situations that happened around my birthday one that ill talk about later i went nc after my dad told me he wanted to see ruth off to college after thanksgiving and threw in my face how i wanted to see my then boyfriend on the day we usually see each other the only good thing i can give to my ex is that hes the reason why i got the guts to even go nc the first time ex was also not great it wouldve turned abusive had the relationship continued but thats the one redeeming quality i can say about him i didnt speak to my dad for years over that time my dad would lash out at my mom still telling her that shes feeding me lies about him so i dont talk to him eventually he seemed to get better hes an alcoholic if he drank he drank heavily and he stopped drinking at some point during that time i personally do not drink because of the things that occurred when he was drunk it wasnt much except he was incredibly scary and was more prone to yelling at people while intoxicated he also went into therapy and started actually doing better during this time as well my mom went through a cancer diagnosis to which she has survived and been declared in remission my junior year at one point i saved her life after she collapsed from severe dehydration graduated high school had to move unexpectedly a month after graduation went through trade school and got my hair license transitioned and started hrt found out the day after i got my license that we were being evicted my mom and i were homeless for months and we finally got back on our feet by the time i started speaking to my dad again i recognize that im dependent on my mom still am as i live with her but we are the only ones we can depend on my aunt doesnt live in the same state and my cousin lives overseas during this period ruth was away at college so she couldnt do much to help either we only had each other its been me and her against the world since weve struggled financially over the years but we always seem to make it work in march about two months before ruth graduated from college my dad and i met in a public place with my mom nearby to talk about everything that went on up until that point from what i remember a lot of the things i said to my dad were things he never considered and he seemed to take things to heart and wanted to change this was the first of times he has apologized to me things got better somewhat but rome wasnt built in a day and neither do fixing strained relationships between a parent and child for about a year after this i tried initiating conversations about the past in gentle ways every time he would freeze up and get very silent and i would feel like i had to change the subject every time he never once tried talking to me about things whenever i brought them up and after a while i just stopped in i went nc a second time because he was hoenstly being a fucking dick over a car he had ownership over i had gotten a car the previous august and it was a stupid purchase if only because i spent what i paid for in car payments in repairs as well during the first year alone he tried telling me not to do something with it i dont remember what and i told him not to contact me until i reached it to him this lasted months we met in a public place again with my mom and this time his girlfriend and talked things out again this is the second time hes ever apologized to me a common theme of all this is im not a priority to my dad my dad can talk about the trauma he went through growing up the trauma he caused my mom and assumedly my sister we dont talk about our dad in that way im not putting ruth in the middle of all this and she is the type to want to find a solution even if there is none apologize to my mom on numerous occasions often unprompted but i can count on one hand how many times hes apologized to me the third time happened last year out of the blue where he called me crying about how he feels bad for ruining our relationship for the years we didnt speak and he wanted to make things right i felt it was genuine and i had thought this was opening a door to future discussions it did not obviously since im here writing this post the weekend of mothers day my dad sent me and ruth several screenshots of a trauma dump he did on a social media site i didnt read any of it frankly it pisses me off still that he even dumped that on us out of the blue not even considering the circumstances and i ignored the conversation he and ruth had about it i vented to my mom about it saying that it hurt that he can just dump his trauma on me but i cant do the same for the trauma he caused me later that evening my dad texted my mom and apologized for the millionth time for a situation she doesnt even remember she told my dad he shouldnt be apologizing to her as he has numerous times in the past already and that he should really apologize to me there was a little back and forth and eventually my dad texts me the next day asking what my mom meant so i told him i told him how ive never felt like i was a priority to him how i wasnt even on the list of people to make amends with how i never felt good enough for him no matter what i did and how i had to basically coddle him talking about this in the past i told him how it hurt knowing that hes apologized to my mom so many times yet i can count on three fingers the times hes apologized to me i told him it feels shitty to see him be open about his own trauma but i cant do the same to him eventually i mentioned how i knew ruth had always been his favorite that is what set him off he told me that he didnt have a favorite child it was a bullshit statement and that he no longer wanted to have this conversation over text i said i would only meet with him if my mom could be there to mediate because im not trusting him to do this alone he agreed told me to pick a time and place and we would meet he even texted my mom saying he understood why i wanted her there and thought it was a good idea the next day i decided on a park in the city i finished high school in we have an elderly dog with anxiety and it would be easier to do that than to find a sitter and texted him asking if that park was okay at this time he messages me back to ask why that park i asked why does it matter you told me to pick a place and i did he sends back well the last time we were meant to meet at this park you stood me up this is the situation i alluded to earlier because during this time i wasnt the best my mom had taken my phone away i had either just turned or about to and there was a rally for a tax levee that the marching band was playing at the rally was at the park i chose my dad was meant to pick me up from the park so we could go celebrate my birthday the city i graduated hs from is very small i lived right behind the high school and i could get to this park in minutes if not faster when i couldnt find my dad and having no way of getting into contact with him i figured i would walk home and if he couldnt find me at the park he would assume the same he didnt instead he called to yell at my mom blaming her for why he couldnt find me and how shitty she is then yelled at me in the car once i got in i was a sophomore in hs at this point or nearly there i was a kid i didnt stand up my dad on purpose things went back and forth from there i told him hes holding a grudge for over years at this point that i also have bad memories with this park hs ex broke up with me at this park in the worst and cold hearted way and that i didnt choose this park as a malicious attack against him i honestly chose the park because its small i know the park well enough that in the event one of us gets lost it would be easy to find each other its a fucking park he didnt put any stipulation on where it could be so i chose that park he told me he doesnt feel comfortable meeting at this park because i stood him up and tried using my bad memories as a gotcha on why we should change locations i stood firm telling him that this is an uncomfortable situation and he should feel uncomfortable i said we are doing this by my terms we are meeting at this park or its not happening at all he throws back okay we can do it at the park but your mom cant be there i said no we are doing this on my terms or not at all i stood firm on this even going as far as threatening to go nc again if he didnt meet me where i stood ill be honest i only said it as a scare tactic because hes admitted to my mom hes scared of me going nc again except he didnt blink at the threat just kept going on about how im being unreasonable and he isnt responsible for the stories i make about him in my head basically calling me delusional so i told him not to contact me again i blocked him everywhere including his number i messaged his girlfriend to inform her of the situation telling her if he tries to contact me through her i will block her as well since then its been hell i have a laundry list of medical issues a lot of them being nerve issues i had carpal tunnel at and got surgery for it while in hair school ive known the whole time ive been cutting hair im doing so on borrowed time and this year i started college to get a degree for when i can no longer do hair my hands started being an issue again in march i figured its because i take handwritten notes and i cut hair and itll go away once the semester ends it didnt it only got worse weeks after the end of the semester my right wrist started hurting but didnt impede on my work until a week later when i had to leave work to go to urgent care because the pain was too much for me to cut hair i tried cutting hair again the next day same thing and again it happened the day before i saw ortho xrays looked fine so i was ordered an mri that didnt happen until about weeks ago mri doesnt show anything except normal wear and tear and my only next step is to get an emg a nerve test if thats inconclusive im shit out of luck because it hurts to cut hair my hours at work have been cut significantly i can only reception work on the weekends so ive received a hour cut plus the tips id normally get to help beef up my paycheck arent there ive already been struggling keeping my head above water since january of this year and right before my current round of medical issues i was almost in the clear my pay has been cut to if that of my normal weekly take home i dont qualify for help through united way the things i need help paying car payment for a car i purchased after the lemon i had loans and credit cards arent listed as options my mom is lucky to work for a fantastic hospital and covers the majority of our bills but shes getting a total shoulder replacement she does have short term through her employer so at least theres that i dont know what to do anymore im trying to find a job but nobody will call me back for an interview i keep getting rejection after rejection the one interview ive had didnt hire me though that manager is trying to get me hired at a different store but who knows i have bills to pay and im only getting a fraction of what i normally get im home all the time and i feel so fucking helpless im reaching my fucking limit on what i can handle nothing good has happened to me since going nc i feel worthless and stupid i feel like im annoying all my friends because i have too much time i really dont know what to do i dont even know what can be done at this point im lucky i still have health insurance through my job and i need good health insurance with the amount of medical issues i have im scared every day and i feel like im going to throw up constantly my appetite is shit ill go hours without eating and only do so when my blood sugar drops low enough my cgm alerts me of it if i do eat i have to eat my safe foods because i will go through making something only to sit down maybe take a bite or two before my body decides that it doesnt want that my sleep is shit even worse than during the semester i feel like im on the verge of a panic attack constantly and i dont want to burden my friends when they have their own shit ive asked for help from friends and family and only people and have come my way i dont know anymore i feel like im being punished for cutting out my dad again i know im not its just a coincidence but i cant help but feel that way everything was fine for a week after the semester ended to this all starting nothing bad happened until i went nc i wonder if things would get better if i reached out but i know it will only cause me more stress i feel like im drowning and everyone is watching and not helping thanks for reading if you do be kind to one another,Positive
ik many people may have this problem but why dose my father just throw things at me and act like he never did,Neutral
so i noticed my dad does this thing where he will listen to my conversations with my sister mom etc and i obviously wont know it can be something as simple as my sister and i talking about my door sagging and my sister saying someone should fix it this happened weeeeks ago a very unimportant comment in my opinion today my sister lazily closed my door according to my dad so the door made an awful noise when it hit the ground my dad said something along the lines of i heard you say it should be fixed but you can just lift the door dont be fuckin lazy this time his remark was more tame but there have been multiple times in the past where he will bring something up and sort of use it against me without me knowing he knew about it it will mostly be conversations i sometimes feel betrayed by this am i overreacting i feel like i have ptsd and am easily triggered i have been feeling more sensitive since attending therapy and while i have progressed a lot in the past year i feel like i have a long way to go the fact that im easily triggered makes me feel like im going backwards but my therapist says it might be because im surpassing things and setting boundaries so it opens up some past trauma,Neutral
im going to be short i have parents who abused me when i was little they liked me to participate in their sexual acts first as a spectator and collaborator in certain acts such as cleaning my fathers genitals with a stocking or inflating used condoms the most thing they made me do was clean my father with my mouth they laughed and so did i i was little and i didnt really understand what happened until i was eleven years old all my life they denied what happened to the point of making me doubt myself but they continued their abuse mocking me hitting me and humiliating me in every way possible typical narcissists as an adult when they were divorced my mother kicked me out of the house and it was only then that i was able to get away from them and have contact today i am married marriage in trouble and with a yearold son who is the best thing in the world my wife does not believe what happened to me perhaps because i never gave her specific details it is difficult for me to give them he was very small and those games with my parents were not traumatic events like my mothers beatings were for example but the fact is that i am firm that if it happens and she says that my parents do not seem like the kind of person who would do that as if they were carrying a sign that says im a pedophile my problem yesterday i fooled myself that i was going to take our son to his night job and then with her to a friends house and in reality he was at my mothers house i hate her for that as soon as i found out we argued i still havent seen in person at the time of writing this i love her with all my soul and it makes me cry to have to abandon her but i dont see any other way out although if i stopped being close to him maybe my son would be more at risk what should i do,Neutral

when i was learning to drive with my dad it was a constant barrage of criticism running commentary shouting and being treated as though i was an idiot it got to the point where i tried to avoid going out for drives as i couldnt take his abuse ive had enough once ive passed my practical test uk and have my own car again i wont be taking him as a passenger,Neutral

my relationship with my father has been complicated hes told me before that if any other parent had to deal with me they wouldve left a long time ago lately hes been telling me how he hates his life and how he doesnt get anything out of going to work and providing for everyone not just with him but with my mom as well i feel like a trauma dump for both of them both of them complain to me over and over again not only about each other but about their own upbringings even after i got sent to a psych ward due to self harming they didnt bother to even try to change one bit but back to my main point my dad told me not to be surprised if he drives himself off a cliff and even went as far as to ask me if id forgive him if he killed himself so im really worried about him now and if he does do it its gonna be my fault and im gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life earlier today he was yelling at me for not sleeping with my exit was my first relationship so i wanted to take it slow but thats a whole other topicand he said that its my fault she left me then he went on to talk about how sex should be my number one priority as an year old boy at that point i just broke down crying to which he started yelling at me asking me why i was crying and threaten to leave for good if i dont tell him why he didnt seem to have even an ounce of sympathy a couple days later when i told him that she broke up with me i got yelled at like times even when i asked him to leave me alone multiple times he just kept continuing to yell and yell at me he went on to tell me that its all my fault because i didnt sleep with her he then went on to tell me yelling how women only want two things sex and money and when i dont listen to him he again threatens to leave the family and take everything away i feel like im watching my whole family fall apart and theres nothing i can do about it if you read my last post you know my family isnt really a family i just want all of this to end all i wanted was i dont know a hug from my father that wouldve been nice maybe for him to not yell at me when i need his support the most a couple weeks ago he told me about how if he was like everyone else he wouldve disowned me a long time ago i feel so alone not even my own family cares about me it seems like ive been considering another suicide attempt and im really scared,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im yrs old live in the ph and i think its time for me to voice out about what my parents did to me mom currently threw a plastic plate in my head which resulted to gush out a lotta blood i only stopped the bleeding when i finally apply cloth to it the worst part is my lil sis witnessed this whole situation it would be really traumatic for her despite not really knowing whats going on ofc this includes myself as im crying and panicking a lot when it bled i wouldve gotten stitched my head but i dont really have enough money for it so its really difficult physically im dealing with a headaches fatigue bruise and swelling mostly at my head injury and mentally i am dissociating depressed and confused i only got checked up publicly so since i cant get it stitched i drink a lot of antibiotics and painkillers its what the doctor prescribed to me however the healing process wont be fast i know i wont get a job for a while bc of my head injury i dont wanna think too much as this triggers me more headaches anyways back to what my parents did they were ashamed of what they did but i fear they might do this again since in their minds i believe they have some sort of generational trauma where abuse was tolerated and wont really realize that its fully wrong mentally they also emotionally abused me a lot and i havent responded to them nicely which yeah resulted to put myself in a dangerous situation i wouldve report them to the authorities but i have the fear of them going to prison i only want them to realize that its wrong i dont want their lifetime to be spent in prison i dont want gossips to be heard all over by my neighbors or my relatives coz yeah that would be really stressful for me and my lil sis so i just had to make excuses about the cause of my head injury like i got tripped at the corner when thats not rlly the cause i know kind of pains me currently shes taking care of my wound which is expected because its my moms fault but its kinda really boring to stay here at bed for the whole day and when i get better im looking forward to get out because its dangerous to put myself and my lil sis here for too long its not always theyd do something this physically abusive but yeah i always fear it gets there due to their lack of emotional managementintelligence and about my dad he was not there when this situation happened since hes currently working ofc it is frustrating for him to witness this but it seems like hes not really taking this as a big deal so ill say that dad hasnt been the greatest dad himself hes got a past history where he hurts my mom and is a massive cheater this family is just messed up and i dont know what to do except to escape outta here,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
so my mother is now a bit older and i just got years old male i think i have been verbally emotionally and physically abused for my i dont know whole life one of my problems is that i dont see how i can get out of this situation and the other is that i feel great shame and guilt i always ask myself if i was better would it be that bad to state some things that she did for context once when i was years old i wanted to go with a friend girl of mine which i really loved and cared for for a outdoorpool to just hang out a bit with her and some other friends of our class my mother had a little nap i had to wake her up so she lets me out of the house because back then if i didnt tell my mother i would go outside she wouldnt let me in till we would clash again for an hour so i woke her up to tell her i go outside she then bashed out screaming loud asf and then took a knife and rushed at me i fell backwards on my back running from here and hit my head ouch and started crying really hard because i really got scared dude i really thought i was about to die and that that was it this was the first time she rushed at me with a knife and where i got hella scared there were many other times she did it where she said shed kill me and stuff but i kinda got used to it over time so i wasnt scared anymore that much she verbally abused me my whole life told me i was shit that i was dumb that i cant sit still ihave diagnosed adhd but she doesnt give a shit cant behave that i should fuck my self even at a young age there were thousand different things she told me and the thing is that i dont give a shit about it no more she still slurs at me to this day when i think about it it scares me that i dont care do you guys get that feeling i told my new gf about this topic with my mom and she was so surprised and stuff and told me that she couldnt imagine that i was kinda confused because i didnt think its a big deal to that point i knew i was getting abused but was it really that bad i was asking myself i was reassuring myself that this happens also to other etc she bite me multiple times literally it kinda hurt and i was confused and scared i was kinda young i cant wear the things i want and if so i have to go through a big conversation at years old bruh she forced me to go to school and be a doctor lmao the normal thing immigrant parents do well now im starting with university but im studying history and philosophy for the start i might switch up some things literature interest me as an example my mother is really disappointed in me because i want to study in these fields well i actually believe she has a valid point in this critic as a parent but still these fields are what interest me the most and what i love to do i just finished school last month and she then told me that i am a lazy prick that doesnt go to work because i had some freetime i then found a job applied and got accepted it pays decent and its a cool job because you help people in need and i thnik thats better than workin in mcdonalds feeding into the consumerism of people nowadays well as i got the job she said no you cant have a job you have university starting and i got confused because she told me to get one now i got one and then this and then she tells me paranoid shit like they might sell your organs and kidnap you btw my mother is blatantly stupid im glad im adopted and have not this monkey genes in common with her but she is still my mother then she told me that i have to give her bank account info so the money goes to her when i said no she screamed hit me it didnt hurt but the screaming is hella annoying then wanted to call to my job and say i wnt do it bruh she physically abused me in my childhood where i was a really vulnerable child she doesnt hit me nowadays as much because she realized that i dont give a fuch about her she got weak she is sick and constantly tells me that she is dying and i dont know what to do well she goes to the doctor and does all the stuff yk but it still hurts her telling me that she is going to die she always plays this card when were arguing for example when i want to go out for a little while she tells me that shes sick and is dying she aint even that sick for context she still is able to perform as good in life as before she just gets into these sick phases some times and then i have to do everything she mainly does the cooking and the rest is often up to me like cleaning etc my mother acts as if im her property she wants to decide everything about my life she wanted to marry me to a girl i absolutely hated i refused she screamed the shit out of her soul got nearly a heartattack proceeds to give the faults to me often when i want to go out with the boys she overcomplicates everything and says that i love my friends more than her blah blah blah im not even going out for a party or doing drugs then she wants to call the police because of my behaviour i was fucking years old is this normal dude i cant even get out of the house man she ends up calling her brother for reassure herself and tells him how bad i am etc her brother always tells her to just let me do these tings and that it is normal btw my whole ass family back in my country hates me because of the portrayal my mother gives of me but they dont like her that much either i fully understand them she is the most irresponsible human being i have ever come across she always gaslights me into thinking every wrong doing of her is because of me occasionally when she walks and just nearly slips she screams at me for no reason i believe she is emotionally unstable she hates one of the only person i love right now and wants to ruin our relationship for context im from swtizerland my mother is an immigrant from kosovo we both live in switzerland and she alsways accused me of becoming too much like a swiss peson i always rebuttal i tell her that i just want to be myself and that i dont see myself as albanian nor swiss because i always tell her that i dont give a fuck about nationality my girlfreind years old is such a cool person i love it but she is swiss which is no problem for me but for my mother we often fight over her she tells me i have to marry an albanian girl i hate albanian people i dont know why just had bad experiences with them i dont want to generalize things but i guess im a bit racist then my mother is hyperconservative traditonalisitc hella racist hateful about everything nationalistic dogmatic and really into islam i left islam i kinda hate religion islam in particular the arrogance of it surprises me she always makes me feel guilty about everything that happen to her telling me i cant leave her or else bad things will happen guess what she doenst know how to talk about topics formally and constructive evrything she says is destructive and dogmatic and dude im dead angry about it im always surprised when i see others talking to their mothers like normal people dude hooooow my dad died i believe my mother is overly controlling because of that because she has noone left her husband is dead he suddenly died in an accident which is why my mother doenst let me go out of the house without a big dispute i believe my mother is a really broken person when i told my mother that i have a psychiatrist she got angry at me and told me to not say anything that happens under the house so the main problems in my life i told her that i just wanted to know ways to handle shte stress of schoold better with adhd etc i never had stress in school it was easy and i had never put any effort in it and only skipped classes i mean i still passed everything so all good she didnt belive me and hit me screamed at me and then i cried again my mother is ashamed of me and openly tells everybody about it how ugly i am how dumb i am how i only read books i dont know what her fucking problem is abot reading and i am not even that ugly my girlfriend is a hell of a grilfriend really pretty and she thinks i am pretty too now to the bigger problem i sometimes feel great shame and guilt about the life of my mother and i cant imagine the pain i would feel if i cut her off she would feel lonely sometimes it feels as my responsibility to make sure she might have a good life i told my psychiatrist that i really feel bad for my mother and that i want to help her but its hard and i dont know how my teacher told me i should get out but its hard this is so easy said but its hard its not even a financial thing dude just the emotional thing that destroys me my psychiatrist told me about that i have built a defensive mechanism because of my mother which explains my emotinal numbness sometimes but sometimes i have moments of great psychological pain where i start crying and feel bad about everything that has happened im sure my mother had a really hard life but i dont know what to do i feel so stressed about it and pressured i just cant figure it out everyone tells me to just get away

my mother prioritizes spending on herself and her boyfriend over my siblings and me last month alone she spent on lingerie while ive only received a pair of jeans in the past year despite the fact that my clothes look really worn out ive stopped complaining because begging her only results in being screamed at and getting called spoiled she basically saves any money that she should spend on her kids so that she can invest it in her own stupid stuff recently i asked her to buy a music event ticket for me as everyone in my class is attending normally i would never spend this much but i have been excited about this since months and was overjoyed when my friends asked me to go with them despite initially agreeing and purchasing them she abruptly changed her mind within like minutes now she insists i give her the money back and has resorted to insulting and calling my friends retards she labeled me an asshole and sternly reminded me that im no longer a child anymore her usual subtle threat of her being able to kick me out furthermore she declared shell never buy anything for me again im hurt and confused i simply wanted to enjoy a common activity with friends yet i ended up being berated and belittled feeling completely pathetic being hurt over something seemingly so unimportant i dont even know what i am supposed to do i dont have any money on my own and i cantt even pay her pack now as she already bought them,Neutral
social services came round today to discuss housing i tried to tell the social worker that me staying with family isnt an option social worker wasnt very happy about that so i tried to work with the social worker and tried to contact the only person i could think of to stay with my cousin shes always been there for me always been supportive of me pretty sure my mum got to her like she did the rest of my family because she has blocked me i have no family i can go to anymore im and homeless i didnt think my mum would go this far but there ya go i guess i honestly dont know what to do anymore i feel like i have no options i feel like im screwed i knew social services getting involved again was gonna be bad and here we are i just wanna cry,Positive

i am a girl living in india a place where beating kids is seen as appropriate and discipline i have one of the most emotionally and physically abusive parents who are absolutely great at gaslighting you the thing about these parents are that they show even their basic duties as a gift in fact my dad says that beating me up is his right my parents are these psychopathic people i once told my mom who is extremely judgemental btw tht its ppl s choice to have sex before marriage and its ok whether they want or not she got crazy and tried to touch and rape me to tell me how dangerous it is do uk when she tried to do it the first time when i was she was telling me how guys rape women and to make sure i understood she tried to demonstrate it a mother is supposed to be a place of warmth and happiness but not for everyone in fact for some she causes horrors that leaves a lifetime impact i hate my moms smell looks the way she talks and walks and everything not because she is ugly or unattractive but because i detest the woman she is my dad is no better he screams and yells at me and beats me up with a bat or a broom he doesnt have patience and is a pathetic cheater what icks me off the most about him are not his beatings but his words i cant say those words for they have hurt me so much so damn much i hate how everyone thinks he is this calm and intelligent person when i am the only one who knows what he does and what a cheater he is my mom has a victim complex once there was this tuition teacher when i was years old she used to hit me a lot and always used to degrade mei am not a dumb kid i scored percent in th recently i guess because i already used to get beaten up at home i couldnt take any more of this so i refused to go to that tuition and started crying my mom dragged me out of the home to go to the tuition since i was just a year old kid i started crying so my mom took me back to our house furious at me for crying in public at home she was so angry at me that she started yelling at me and telling me how she wanted me to die all i could do was cry on the floor but then she pounced on me and started pulling my hair so hard that i was sure i would die i tried to push her off me because a grown year old woman was trying to choke me to death i swear that was the first time i saw death my survival skills took over and i pushed her with all the strength a yr old could muster but of course she was too heavy for me so i pulled her hair back and when she loosened her grip a little i escaped her hold then she called all her sistersmy cousins and my tuition teacher to tell them about how i hit her and slapped her at i was labelled as an abuser then her sisters talked to me about how i was an abuser and that i should be handed over to police i couldnt understand what was going on and all i could do was cry suddenly the tuition teacher comes through our door and i am sitting outside on our couch she comes and slaps me hard on my face and i am shocked then she drags me to tuition where she makes me write a poem about how much i love my mother at tuition i was insulted and put forward as an example of what not to be in future then when i came back home my dad said if your parents are trying to kill you its a blessing and then i got beaten up by him so few days earlier my mom was pulling this same thing and then she tore up my diary i had been keeping this diary since i was sexually assaulted another story and tht diary had been my only consolation ever since that day i am on edge and i hate myself,Positive

my parents seem to have a cycle of bullying me and threatening my safety saying they will kick me out onto the street or saying they will take away all access to internet and then trying to fawn over me and obsess over and coddle me my dad will occassionally apologize and say that he overreacted but within a few days they will find something else to shout at me about and say i am lazy and entitled and that they should kick me out because i am taking advantage of them and the cycle repeats but every time within hours of the event they will act as if they never did anything they will see me and smile and be offended if i dont smile back every time i shut down around them my dad says i am going into autistic mode my mom plays the victim if i dont want her to touch me and she says that she just wants connection i tried to come out as queer with a new name to try and start over but my mom gave me the silent treatment for days after and then its like they forgot about that part of me and if i bring it up i am being unfair and threatening their emotional health when i ask why they wont acknowledge my being queer they either say its because their religion says its wrong or mom says that my deadname is the name she gave me when i was born and it is imortant to her i am not allowed to change my middle name either they say that both of them cant think about me in any other way if i talk about my mental health struggles at all they say i obsess too much and i should just get a job and that i dont work hard enough and have not suffered enough i acknowledge everything would be better if i get a job even though as much as i try i dont even make interviews my dad says that if i wanted a job i would have one by now i know they gaslight me i know they are emotionally immature i just dont know how deep it goes in their perspective and i dont know if they are consciously aware of the pain they cause that when i try to say i am suicidal my mom gets triggered and she shouts at me once said that my being suicidal makes her suicidal shes grabbed me and not let me get away and she always seems to act before thinking like if shes emotional hurt she will remove all my access to family account connections like amazon so i cant use amazon prime shipping when needed i feel like i am insane because these parents give me toptier ipads for christmas and really expensive tech but then they turn around and say they can take it away i feel guilty for even thinking of how they treat me as abuse my dad says my mom loves me so much and would do anything to protect me and feels so much pain for me my dad has also said that if it was an ultimatum between me and my mom he would always choose my mom and then blames me if mom leaves late at night after an argument and says were getting a divorce this is what you wanted are you happy to be clear i dont want them to divorce i dont want to hurt them even by estranging myself from them i dont know how to reconcile any of this the side of them that coddles me with the side that makes me afraid i will be homeless and without medication management support that makes me feel so unsafe and struggling emotionally i am for reference graduated from college as of december after almost seven years but have a few disabilities that make it hard to even find work i am using vocational rehab so i am currently dependant on my parents and suicidal depression makes it hard to even focus on getting a job when i am just trying to make sure i stay alive,Positive
i thought my parents would change when i came out as transgender female at first they accepted but as ive been living here last few months particularly my dads behavior is getting worse hes been being extremely political lately which is part of the problem is he watches stuff on youtube i dont agree with it apparently he sees me and my mom as slaves now were supposed to clean the house and do everything he doesnt want to do he has kicked me out before for refusing to clean i told my mom that if he did that i wouldnt speak to ether of them again i would leave he also said after i had decided to clean that he was going to raise my rent not to mention i currently feel fatigued and ill because im sort of sick im at my literal breaking point rn,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i dont think my parents were outright abusive but i dont know where else to post this maybe they were neglectful in some aspects i apologize in advance that is a very long post im ftm by the way my dad used to be an alcoholic and would allow my siblings and i to watch really raunchy movies and the show bojack horseman when we were younger i watched the th and th seasons of bojack with my dad when they came out i was i also saw a lot of south park when i was younger one time my dad picked me up from a volleyball game told me he was fucking hammered my dad has made a lot of inappropriate sex jokes about my siblings and i one time he joked about my sister being a lesbian and having a large tongue my dad asked me if i knew what masturbation was when i was in th grade and he tells my family that its funnier to add the words in bed to the end of fortune cookies and i got a fortune cookie that said something like it takes a long time to figure out what works and my dad said that was true my brother told me that olive oil was used as lube because thats a mildly interesting history fact and my dad overheard and said he tried it and it didnt work very well my parents have had sex in the same room as my siblings and i it would happen in hotel rooms and the camper when we were camping and my parents always thought we were all asleep and i dont think my sisters have ever heard anything but my brother and i have also my parents bedroom is right above mine i dont want to be hearing them have sex my dad has gotten extremely drunk and had some kind of breakdown im not sure what to call it but he yells at people this has happened three times the first time this happened was about years ago my family and i had just come from a basketball game and we were trying to walk back to our car but my dad kept walking off and talking about how he wanted to die i cried and my mom got mad at me for crying when we got back to our car my dad left again my siblings and i went after him we told him not kill himself and a stranger told him that it gets better my dad said thanks and eventually we got back to the car and went home the second time this happened was almost years ago on my sisters birthday this is the only time this happened and my family was at home my dad got drunk and he started screaming at my mom about how he needed to find his phone and how my mom needed to help him find it she said no and my dad took the van and drove off i dont remember if this was before or after he left but my dad told me to not cry and that it wasnt my problem my dad crashed the side of the van into a tree and now you cant open the right door of our van because it has a really hard time closing the third time this happened was about a year ago and it was the most stressful my family and i were going on a trip we had to do a layover in florida and were going to spend the night there my dad got drunk in the airport and he called the hotel and kept asking for a shuttle there was never a shuttle my dad kept insisting there was a shuttle the hotel was asking about the reservation and asked for the code that was emailed to my dad my dad started saying there wasnt a code and i offered to take the phone and finish the call myself but my dad said that would just make him angry i started crying in the airport because he was being drunk and angry and im sensitive like that my brothers girlfriend who was with us called over a taxi because she was fed up with my dad and we needed to get to the hotel when we got to the hotel it was a whole other situation apparently we didnt have the money to pay for the hotel night im fairly certain we did and my dad just wasnt figuring it because he was extremely drunk my dad started crying about going to jail because my dad was taking care of his dad and adult protective services were charging him because he wasnt taking care of my grandpa well my dad was yelling about how he was going back to america and my sister told him that he was still in america and my dad started yelling about something else then my dad tried paying for our hotel rooms again and started talking to the receptionist about how there wasnt a shuttle i told my dad that it didnt matter at this point if there was a shuttle or not because we are at at the hotel now my dad told me to not fucking talk to him like that i started crying harder and my mom was so fed up with it she paid for our hotel rooms herself even though it was supposed to be a vacation paid by my dad we had rooms one for me my brother and his then girlfriend one for my sisters and one for my parents anyway we got the keys to our rooms the receptionist was a very nice person who didnt speak a lot of english and my brother and i apologized to him profusely the receptionist gave my brother and i free bottled waters and told us to have a good night i was still crying and i told him to have a good night too i actually think about him sometimes because he was so patient with my dad even though my dad was being horrible in the hotel room my brother his then girlfriend and i were just trying to distract ourselves with the internet no one could fall asleep eventually my mom came into the hotel room and thanked me for telling my dad he was being shitty she told me she couldnt do it anymore and that she had to go tell him that she loved him and that hes not a bad person i feel so bad for my mom because i know this has happened to her a lot more than its happened to the rest of my family in the morning my dad said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart and one of my sisters said she forgave him i didnt thats not okay also my dad got drunk in a hotel a few years ago and threw his phone on the floor so hard it broke because he got mad about door dash not working my siblings and i still joke about that one because that was really stupid any time my dad drinks now he gets physically sick so he cant drink anymore my parents starting dating when my mom was and my dad was my dad was my moms debate coach and my mom became a high school dropout when she was to go live with him and they got married when my mom was i didnt know how my parents met until i was about and i only learned because my brother told me i did think my parents age gap was weird though i once made a joke about underage drinking in front of my mom and she said she only underage drank when my dad gave her alcohol i overheard my parents talking a few weeks ago and it was interesting my mom has been thinking about getting a divorce or going to marriage counseling for the last months my dad doesnt want to do either my mom said she was in an inappropriate relationship with him when she was a child i didnt hear what my dad said but soon after he said he doesnt like the way my mom treats him i was in the car with my dad a few weeks ago and my dad told me how my mom has been talking to him more and more about their relationship and my mom told my dad that she didnt think my dad is catholic no one in my family except my mom is religious my dad has been lying to my mom their entire relationship about how he is catholic my dad actually got baptized as an adult and told me about how fucking wasted he would get before those meetings my dad told me that my mom wishes she had a good catholic family and how he never wanted anyone to go to church in the first place i honestly wish my parents never started dating because i believe they would both be happier if they never did my mom doesnt listen to anything anyone says its extremely infuriating recently i had a big argument with her because our dryer was broken and i asked her if she could call someone to get it fixed she said no and i asked why but she just kept saying she wouldnt do it i cried a lot about this because this was a problem that affected our entire family and she wasnt doing anything about it my brother fixed it hes good with machines a few years ago i got into a really big argument with my mom because she kept putting bread in the freezer i live in a family of putting bread in the freezer is doing nothing and was only taking up freezer space apparently i asked in a mean way or whatever because my mom said i dont want to help you if youre freaking out i gave up trying to win that argument i got into a lot of arguments with my mom when i was about but i stopped trying to win them i have learned that nothing i say to her will matter i still have a poor relationship with my mom but i dont care about fixing it the rest of my family has similar issues with her my dads main issue with my mom is that they cant communicate and my mom not listening is part of that my mom used to sign my siblings and i up for alter serving and mass readings without asking and this would always bother us so much about a year ago my mom signed my sister for a mass reading and my sister was infuriated and called my mom a bitch my sister ended up doing the reading but my mom was really mad at my sister any time i get into an argument with my mom one of my first thoughts is i hate that goddamn woman this has happened multiple times but i do not know if it is true i can get along with my mom but i would rather not talk to her everything she does bothers me in some way which i think is unfair to her and she is the only person in my life who i seriously dislike i started self harming at the first time i ever cut myself it was a few cuts and i went into my living room to show my parents these weird cuts they didnt say anything or seem to care at all i mainly self harmed on my legs for a few years my brother got a girlfriend who self harmed my brother was and so was his girlfriend when i was my family was at my brothers girlfriends house because our families were actually really close because our parents got along and all the kids were similar ages well my brothers girlfriend cut her arm while we at their house when we driving home my mom told my siblings and i that if we ever wanted to hurt ourselves we can always talk to her i remember thinking no ive been doing this for years no when i was my mom saw self harm cuts on my hands she asked me if i ever did it anywhere else and i lied and told her no she told me that some people are into weird shit and i just laughed awkwardly i told her i wouldnt do it again a few weeks later one of my friends reported me to my school counselor for self harm my counselor asked me if i wanted to tell my parents about my self harm and i knew that it was required for them to tell my parents im still mad at her for giving me an illusion of a choice even though i knew there was never one so my parents told me they loved me and told me to not hurt myself again i lied and said okay my mom wanted me to go to therapy so i went to a single online therapy session i really really did not want to go to therapy i told my parents i didnt want to go to therapy again and my dad defended me because he didnt want me to be put in a box my dad also has some weird beliefs about being medicated my mom said that i didnt have to go to that therapist but maybe i could try again in a few months so a few months later about the same time i was i was supposed to go to another online therapy session my parents saw more self harm cuts on my hands my parents told me that when im hurting myself im hurting them too thats not helpful assholes dont make it about yourself i said i was sorry but i refused the other therapy session my dad kept defending me and i didnt have to go also my mom told our extended family about my self harm and never told me i only know this because my grandma gave me a photo of jesus holding someone like me and she told me it would help with my anxiety i hate that my mom told anything i didnt even want her knowing this was nearly years ago i accept now that i need therapy but i will not be asking for therapy while i am still living with my parents i do not feel comfortable asking for it i do not feel comfortable asking them for almost anything im trans and my parents dont do a great job of supporting me i am fully socially transitioned and have been out for over a year all of my friends and people that i know except extended family use my correct name and pronouns my dad uses my name in front of me and im fairly certain he doesnt when talking to other people my mom doesnt even try she only thinks of me as her daughter and nothing i do will ever change her mind i came out to my parents twice and both times it was over text the first time it was really basic and i told them my name and pronouns and i told them i loved them the second time was a few weeks later and i told them that i wanted them to start using my name and pronouns because i was hurt that they werent trying my dad said that he was using theythem for me and my mom said we never got to talk about how im trans i use hehim pronouns and what is there to talk about im trans im your son the end i have a really hard time correcting people about anything so i dont even try to correct my parents it seriously hurts my feelings but im not doing anything about it i have always had a really difficult time understanding math even though i do fairly well in other subjects one time in rd or th grade my mom was helping me with math homework but all she did was call me stupid until i cried my dad actually watched this happen and didnt say anything when i was younger around kindergarten age my mom slapped me twice at different times my dad asked me if my mom had ever hit me and i told him no because i didnt want my parents to argue anytime the topic of child abuse is brought up my mom asks my siblings and i if we are traumatized my siblings and i never answer but almost every time my parents are out of the house my siblings and i talk about the annoying things our parents do my dad has told me that his parents beat him and i know he didnt have the greatest childhood i know my mom had helicopter parents and grandma is still weird to be around my grandma always thinks people are talking poorly about her and thinks everyone around her is ungrateful she makes a lot of people in my family just straight up uncomfortable especially my aunt also my mom usually makes dinner and always puts the food away after maybe minutes this has caused everyone in my family to eat really quickly and any time i eat with other people i am always the first person to finish eating and it makes me so self conscious my mom rushes everything if something is brought to her attention it needs to be taken care of immediately if we need to go somewhere she rushes everyone to the car as fast as possible and gets really passive aggressive really quickly this is sometimes helpful but most of the time its just stressful my parents do not listen to me when i talk about my interests this hurts my feelings a lot because i really appreciate being listened to i have very strong interests in certain topics and i used to tell my parents about them all the time i realized they do not listen to me when i was about and this hurt my feelings very badly it still does when i was younger my parents had this rule that my siblings and i had to go to school unless we threw up like it didnt matter if we were sick unless we threw up i believe they started this to deter my siblings and i from faking illness but we werent the kind of kids to do this in the first place one time in th grade i really was sick i dont remember all of my symptoms but i had really bad headaches and was extremely exhausted for a week but i never bothered telling my parents because i never threw up and i knew they would make me go to school anyway in th grade i got sick i really really wanted to stay home so i tried to force myself to throw up in order to stay home i didnt have the puking kind of illness but i was sick my mom caught me trying to vomit and got mad at me but she let me stay home i dont think she believed i was sick but didnt care enough to force me to go to school my parents thankfully havent enforced this rule in over years and if im really adamant about not going to school they dont make me i dont overuse this i skip about days a school year my parents argue a lot by the way it used to be a lot worse but its still not pleasant but they havent argued really badly in a few years because my dad seemingly gave up anyway i prefer being around my dad than my mom by a lot i do wish my parents were better i wish i could tell them about my interests and they would listen i wish i could my parents that i had a hard day i want them to be better but i dont think i am ever getting that when i was years old and my brother was he sexually abused me i still feel really weird saying that because i dont think it was actually that bad but i do not know what else to call it im not going into detail of what my brother did for this post but rather what my parents did because the answer is nothing my brother and i slept in the same basement in the same bed for years i have no idea how our parents didnt think anything could be wrong one time when i was my brother took pictures of me shirtless well my mom found them and confronted me about it i clearly did not take the pictures and she was mad at me she told me about how someone could use the photos for child porn and she deleted the pictures but i seriously have no idea how she didnt think about how i did not take them myself during the last year of this my brother and i slept in the attic together again i have no idea how my parents never thought anything was wrong but mostly im mad at my mom for not thinking anything was wrong when she found the pictures of me shirtless thank you very much for reading i really do appreciate it i just want to know if my parents could have been better i dont think they ever wanted to be bad parents but maybe they could have been there more for my siblings and i,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i f live with my family i grew up with an emotionally abusiveneglective mom and a physically abusive little sister sometimes my mom would join in on the physical abuse but it was never anything serious until a year ago i have past trauma of being sexually assaulted by my ex step dad years ago and my mom keeps putting off therapy about a year ago my mom started spanking me out of the blue it wasnt as punishment or anything she just did it i would be minding my own business and she would come up behind me and smack my butt ive expressed how much this made me uncomfortable multiple times but she would pull the victim card and accuse me of calling her a pervert and how i hurt her feelings she kept doing it and i had to bare with it i was ok with dealing with it in silence until recently about a week ago my mom smacked my butt again but this time i told her straight up that it makes me uncomfortable and i dont appreciate her touching me like that she just ignored me and complained about me to my now step dad i thought she would stop after that but the very next day she did it again she never stops no matter how many times ive asked her to stop she knows about how ive been sexually assaulted multiple times starting back when i was but she wont stop i dont have the money to move out and i have no friendsfamily to stay with what should i do any advice,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hi im a teenage girl and i have two older brothers and a single mom ever since i was little guys have come in and out of the house usually they are weird or sketchy as in the do drugs alcohol criminal past etc this is due to my moms rough childhood past and her broken boy slection she also has a rathelarge savior complex she is also a crazy minopulator so when the guys realize it they tend to get the hell out i dont blame them so basically my moms new bf moved in with his little year old the year old does have some behavior issues exlies repeatedly asks for things spoiled annoying screams a lot but personally i dont consider them to be that bad she has gone through her own personall trauma however my mom since she is licensed to work with kids thinks she can fix her she has been doing all sorts of disciplines which i believe have now gone too far ex feeding her spicy strachan when she misbehaves making her repeat tomes that shes not in control spanking her multiple times rather hard making her weardiapers because she peed in the bed making her cut apart her own stuffed animals making her do lots of exercises upstairs naked screaming and yelling at her would you consider this abuse i personally am starting to and i havenever seen my mom like this i think she is taking her frustrations out on the girl what should i do my mom is a manipulator and at this point the bf is thinking of moving out,Neutral
im not gonna throw my whole story about my mom but to sum it up was going through the worst time of my life i was and became super depressed ended up almost dying intentionally and she told me i was being dramatic when i revealed i tried then babies my brothers acts sexist racist homophobic and always belittles and berates me constantly says things and lies and manipulates my worst example yet was i asked if my brother was okay when he was being taken to the hospital and they said yes so i didnt worry and continued on with the week only today to hear my mom telling everybody he almost died later which freaked me out i went to bed that night crying on the spot in the couch he was laying in alone since i was alone those entire days so little rant here my mom can be nice and gives great advice but she also can be terrible like when i was and she told me that everything happening to me was my fault and im too blame to her getting mad at me for standing up for myself and more recently her looking at me and telling me looks like you need to get your but on the peloton shes made me hate myself countless times and is the main reason i can barely eat dairy gluten and sugar anymore because she ignored me when i would cry in pain and tell her everyday i was hurting until the point i almost had a stomach ulcer it took me whole years to convince my mom i wasnt faking being in pain and now im finally better however my stomach got heavily damaged and now i cant eat any of that really another great example was i was laying on the couch in pain and she came back home from going shopping and started yelling at me causing me of just wanting to hang out in my ipad while i was laying there crying in pain i didnt know why until she said oh its cause you ate yogurt and i was confused then she said oh yeah youre lactose intolerant i think youre supposed to tell your kids what the allergy and intolherence testing says also she was the one who made it for me knowing full well it would make me be in pain i have a great example here i get hot flashes often since im going through puberty and my mom got mad at me for wanting to wear loose shorts in celsius keep in mind im born and raised in canada she told me to go put leggings on and i calmly explained that they were too hot and told her i checked the weather and everything i also had a sweater because my legs were just really hot in both ways jk she then started screaming at me and told me if i wore shorts in this weather i would look like a freak and an attention whore funniest part is my dad was right beside me wearing a tshirt and shorts i was more dressed than him and my brother was wearing shorts too shorter than mine she also constantly tells me i need to start working out more and will squeeze my legs or my but as she says that great im going into highschool i dont need to be more self conscious and i am not overweight by any means but then again i also dont know my weight since im not allowed to know thats just what doctors have said in medical examinations another thing thats pissing me off is my brother recently went to the hospital which of course i feel terrible because he couldve literally died luckily its just a condition not serious or anything no organ or brain damage so hes okay hell be back to normal in a couple of days but because of this huge development my parents cancelled my entire birthday which is weeks away which this is the one year i actually got one see every year for my birthday my mom would ask people to bring cans of food and then shed donate it all which is awesome i love that but as a year old who really wanted a scooter it sucked and i wasnt allowed to have friend birthdays either just family im not mad about gifts or anything i actually specifically told my entire family to not get me anything for my birthday because i dont like getting gifts my birthday day was going to be my family actually spending the day with me thats all i wanted she also acts like im lesser in many ways ill voice a concern such as me almost passing out and throwing up after using a tampon and shell tell me im being over dramatic but the second she sees my brother even slightly sad she legitimately went hes depressed i was laying in bed staring at the wall with tear running down my face for weeks on end and you did nothing nothing dont fucking tell me i dont know what suicidal depression is not to mention her obviously being sexist and being okay with my great uncle gropping my butt he is mentally challenged i understand that but she still makes me hug him whenever i see him which is alright i guess just uncomfortable because hes very touchy she also gives me these rules work out times a week do all the laundrey do all the dishes i mean for everyone for both those things hang out with friends once a week get as in everything hours of homework every night no wearing pajamas outside of your room not allowed to mix two baggy clothes together at least the pants or the shirt has to be tight no spending any of your money all of it goes into savings and also maximum amount of gluten a day slices of bread maximum amount of dairy fudgecicle maximum amount of sugar popsicle rarely a couple chips also no soda at all since it causes cancer and not much meat since it also causes cancer and also nothing not natural because it all causes cancer she also yells at me a lot like she once yelled at me because i couldnt find her shoes and stayed screaming at me in anger and i will ask her something like hey can you help me with a projec no im already stressed enough ughhhh its so annoying sometimes she rarely lets me finish sentences and tells me dont be negative when i tell her about this girl i dont like at school ill also tell her hey dont tell anyone this like some really private stuff were talking like stuff about my body too and shell go and tell everyone and then say i didnt know im sorry ahhhhhh sometimes i dont know what to think she critiques me in every way possibly i bring home a report card of all as and she says good job and thats it she hasnt even let me seen my own report card she gets mad at me for not working out for days straight and for eating junk food a popsicle and tbh i would go outside but i dont have anyone to go with i dont like the kids in my class ive made that very clear yet my mom continues to get mad at me for not being more social i linked up today how to get outside more because i am trying to cut down my screen time and all i saw was family activities i didnt realize spending a whole day with your family in summer was normal like just waking up and going to the beach or something or grabbing ice cream and talking i didnt know that was normal and now im starting to question everything,Positive
long story short i need help my mother has been emotionally and vocally abusive for a large portion of my life i think i was barely a preteen when it started but my memories of the early incidents are hazy and i dont remember exactly when she began targeting me i know i grew up with her berating and belittling dad whenever he misunderstood something or got something wrong or sometimes for no reason at all shed scream at him and cuss despite her children being right there she still does that the only difference is she takes her frustrations out on me too she especially loves targeting my insecurities and my health conditions both physical and mental she accuses me of faking my tics for attention she calls me lazy and ungrateful because my depression and arrhythmia make moving around the house a chore shes mocked my sensory issues on facebook in front of everyone and called me a crybaby because i hated the texture of some clothes she bought me more than once she has compared my issues to her own rpe trauma saying i should be grateful i dont have it as bad gaslighting traumadumping you name it now shes even tried to throw me out of the house because i refuse to get a job even though my unmedicated depression anxiety and arrhythmia make that nearly impossible with the arrhythmia alone i often have to sit down to bathe myself in the shower or wash the dishes because my heartbeat skyrockets and i might pass out otherwise im now and i cant call child protective services or anyone to help me escape however ive called both the aps and the police with little result my panic attacks have gotten so much more frequent and im constantly on edge just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for her to blow up on me again i can barely even eat anymore because shes always around ive had maybe two whole bananas split across three unfinished ones in over a week now my heart is really starting to fight back my boyfriend has recently started a fundraiser to help me out of my situation if anyone is willing to spend any money or just share the news i can pm the link,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
f i was in the heat of a panic attack and i was asking my mom for reassurance that im okay and she starts screaming at me and almost hit me like times and i asked her to stop yelling she said how else am i supposed to make you listen this is how you make kids listen back in my day when i was crying and shaking and she knows i dont go good with people yelling around me because of my dad and she said how do you think i feel having to put up with your shit like this all the time i cant call anyone like police wise since if she goes to jail ill be stuck with dad and hes not safe to be around due to addiction and if he gets arrested ill be basically homeless idk what to do this isnt the first time something like this has happened this happens on an almost daily basis but i need others opinion on what this seems like because no one is listening to me irl,Neutral

im just recently at coming to terms with the fact that my mom was abusive she hasnt really done most of it since a few years ago now for some reason idk why she still love bombs and makes me feel really guilty for not wanting to be around her she has always love bombed but was also abusive and filled with hate maybe im just not remembering but as the middle kid i dont think she was like that with either of my brothers im still the one most messed up in the head but i dont know if she abused me because of that or if im like this because of the abuse was anyone else here the only one of your siblings that you remember or are being abused if so do you have any thoughts on it or anything thanks,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
at least five different people have seen her and concluded the mother has extreme envy but when questioned she even becomes violent and contemptuous towards the child mocking it showing malicious envy when the child has something she wants she tries to get it for herself first and when the child does better than her she tries to destroy her to a level where she doesnt look as bad she involves herself gratuitously with the child who she has betrayed in an issue with the father who therefore wants to cut off contact with her but always to try to slander mock and try to cut the child down and determine what she can and cant do she refuses to see the child as an adult and when asked to either support her child or eff off she says she never wanted to be a mother she then tries to misgender her child or say horrific things about her passing opinions she has no right to pass anymore given she economically abused the child out of the claim she didnt ever want to be a mother just sheer hate oozing off of her essentially she is raiding the daughters life for parts as her mother while trying to claim she never wanted to be a mother extreme malicious envy to the point of violence apparent what would you do ive never seen someone this bad its really hard to be the child of someone like this who people actively can see is in malicious envy then denies it then denies ever wanting to be a mother while passing opinions when she shouldnt be involved but then claiming the mother card when she gets caught in involvement,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my partner broke up with me a month ago in a severe mental health crisis hes currently hot and cold and caught between wanting me back and feeling scared of how he treated me during the breakup he was verbally and emotionally abusive thats not typical i kind of knew throughout our relationship but have been really putting the pieces together that a lot of our issues have come down to his family accepting him back not just for me but for the mental state hes been in his family is generationally poor but ran into extreme wealth right before he was born his entire life was planned for him before he was born but he turned out to be disabled and gay he had a super tumultuous upbringing was kicked out and spent his teen years homeless in active addiction with his family turning a blind eye i have some family with money and their dynamic reminds me a lot of mine its a very well give you reward money if youre doing well but if you dont meet expectations were not gonna help you you have to help yourself type of system a year ago my boyfriend was given a check from his grandparents for the first time since he was shortly after he found out he has an inheritance i started to notice a shift after this he started denying his parents abuse and being selfcritical in really intense ways that reflected his upbringing this was obviously concerning me but i have been down that road before with my family being nicer to me and i know its just so hard when you just want family i was really expecting this shift to kind of run its course when hed go home without me almost every time hed call me having a panic attack unsure of why im honestly questioning now why i didnt try to find a kind way of saying it i was worried hed get upset or start to break down he wasnt in therapy until very recently was trying to get him in for months before he made that step i just know how jarring and unnerving it is to remember how bad things were and i didnt want to push that work or let him go through it unsupported outside of the person telling him hed come back from these visits totally shaken up but denying it but something i didnt quite realize the full extent to until recently is how much the ways he treated me were influenced by his family dynamics he started to be ableist toward me were both disabled obsessive around money im pretty sure he was playing a money game with me that i wasnt aware of in that i think he was expecting me to hold up ends on certain things without telling me because i make less than him his behavior and treatment of me started to feel really off like i was missing something around the start of this year and honestly the only time ive seen something like this was from people with money having expectations they dont tell you about and this is super opposite to who he is hes an anarchist hes struggled more with physical disability than i have being bedbound for long stretches of time and having to use mobility aids at certain points at the start of our relationship he lent me some money he told me he was more than comfortable giving me because i was struggling to pay rent he actually insisted he has continually upheld that hes more than happy to through this break up hes told me if im ever struggling financially to let him know but sometimes when hes mad he says things that are just a little bit off feel like a little resentment and ive kept my concerns about family and the impact on him mostly to myself if he ever outright denies his past i say hold on xyz happened and he kind of shrugs it off he started calling his mom a lot before he broke up with me and both times he broke up with me most of what he talked about was his career and financial success i asked him one time to question if a specific thing his mom said aligned with what he wanted and he screamed dont talk about my mom like that its just so tough im the only person whos seen this development and its getting to a really concerning point his familys inclusion of him again is supporting all of his biggest fears around financial insecurity tied to his homelessness trauma but its all conditional love i think he feels afraid that he wont be successful enough to be good in the eyes of his family the shitty thing is my dad went down this road to an extreme and i know that even when you do everything you can youre just never enough hes pushing himself way past the point of burnout in terms of work and career success and he cut me off instead of the work after telling me he was planning the opposite but then he called his mom again im really scared for the day he realizes that he chose conditional love tied up in money by people who abused him over unconditional support and love from someone who holds him while he screams and cries who encourages him to tell himself that hes enough and to do selfwork for himself and him alone until he believes it he always tells me i give the best advice that im the kindest and most patient person to him he has other wonderful supports in his life that he doesnt use his mom gives advice thats super questionable sometimes all about success and sometimes she just says the meanest offhanded remarks when hes trying so hard but even though i tried to stay out of the game and let it play itself out it became me vs them and im worried this isnt about our relationship anymore its about the slippery slope for him and the way hes been treating himself i wrote some pages about my dads experience of embracing abusive family with money that honestly has so many parallels to him just went way too far unnoticed for way too long i cant think of another way to express concern i worry about talking to him directly with how its gone in small moments before but i also question if i should express concern at all i dont want the whiplash of not trusting anyone not right now but his family are not good for him in this way you can keep family but you have to keep them at a distance when theyve hurt you like this you have to question their advice i had to he does still trust me but theres some broken trust its hard to tell where hes at he started to have false memories about me and believe i was manipulating him i honestly weirdly think its because i was always honest with him hes used to people lying were low contact until he stabilizes enough to hold a conversation with me

i have come to reddit for the communities opinion i am and so is my now ex girlfriend we met online and she thought i was cute so we started dating through are relationship that lasted around few months she had opened up to me about a few deep things i feel bad sharing it but i wont say anything about her so her identity is still covered anyways she had started telling me about her life she has been raped multiple times her mom was arrested because a bad boyfriend got her into drugs etc she opened up to me about one topic that truly stuck out and broke my heart but now im wondering who is telling the truth so my ex she had told me about many occasions of her being abused i have about screenshots of messages from her telling me about the living hell her dad and stepmom have been putting her through when she was her dad threw her off her bed and threw her into a barbie dream house and many occasions of her dad hitting her then her stepmom made it even worse she told me that it started when the stepmoms younger son wouldnt give my ex her stuff back he grabbed her stuff i believe makeup or her phone and wouldnt give it back so she took it from him she said she wasnt aggressive not like she threw him to the floor to get the item but her stepmoms reaction was a because of a situation that was max a so she said after her stepmom saw her then tackled her to the ground my ex said she tried defending herself by throwing a metal cup at her but it didnt work she said after her stepmom tackled her onto the tile floor she started yanking her head back and forth smashing her head against the floor she said her stepmom was on top of her and she was loosing chunks of hair because how she was pulling she ended up with a concussion went to the hospital told the nurse and since her stepmom acted nice they didnt believe her when she told me that i was literally on the verge of suicide and homicide because i was so upset anyways please tell me what i should do to help i tried telling cps multiple times and do even got an adult to call and i called back later and told them who called and they just did nothing my ex said she tried the police to etc i also believe it because someone from her school who she never talks to said she noticed some bruises and when she got the concussion she told everyone her and her friends had just been playing rough edit it was all lies she was a total liar,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

i stopped going to my dads a few months ago because my step mom hit me one night claiming i threatened my brother now i live with my mom and sometimes see my dad and two younger siblings when we go to eat at a restaurant or something that are and i want to stay in there lifes but how,Neutral
i have a little brother thats much younger than me and still living with my narc father my father is emotionally and physically abusive to my mother i grew up with a messed up perception of relationships i would endure so much abuse since my brother is a male im worried he will grow up to be an abuser,Neutral
i was verbally and physically abused by my dad from ages my parents divorced when i was in th grade and he moved out thats when it stopped i am now and he has entered a relationship with a new woman who has younger kids i cant tell if im projecting my past experiences with him but the way he talks to the kids makes me anxious and uneasy i dont know if its just in my head or not but whenever he talks to them i hear an aggressive and impatient tone like the one he used to speak to me in has anybody else had the same feeling and am i valid for feeling like this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
it was a long time ago probably back during the late searly s when my father used to inflict physical abuse upon me he eventually changed however his behavior hasnt he now inflicts verbal emotional and psychological abuse onto me he calls me names he yells at me he yells swear words at me he makes fun of my interests and ruins my day etc and whenever i talk to him it seems like he plays the victim and compares how his parents used to beat him despite the fact that he was born in the s and i was born in its also not just towards me but also to my sister and stepbrother and he also does this when his wife my stepmom or any other adult is gone and talks smack about them behind his back i cant take this anymore i dont want to be with him what should i do especially since he often gaslights me into trusting him and how his wife and mother defend him,Neutral
i apologize if i seem a little scattered right now this all happened today for some background i f have been living on my own with my husband for about months unfortunately we moved to an apartment and i could only take two of my cats i opted to keep my oldest cat cinnamon ginger cat where he was the most familiar he was very frail and wouldnt have tolerated being moved safely well my mom asked me to come over to help take care of some paperwork after she asks me she goes basically oh yeah cinnamon has been missing for a few days and i havent seen him i went over today to look for him and confirmed that she had not seen him in at least days we got into an argument over this which i recorded i will post the link here tw heavy language direct mention and innuendo of abuse after this argument i searched to no avail and decided to get something to drink and eat at home and for a chance to gather my feelings i went and looked a total of three times each time confronting my mother about where my cat was as well as the bubbling forces bottled up of all of the abuse ive experienced then the third time i went over i noticed what looked like a decomp stain on the carpet in the exact shape of a cat positioned in a th loaf as a cat does with its head touching the ground the stain alone wasnt enough for me to confirm exactly something told me to check outside i slowly waded through tall grass and jaggers on the property as its on an acre there i found a fresh square shaped grave that appeared to have sunken since the ground was damp my mother lied to me the whole time and my cat was unfortunately already deceased,Neutral
not bothering with a throwaway because none of my family really use reddit and if they do i doubt theyre in this sub my m father m is abusive as all hell he hasnt been physically abusive since about two years ago though the brunt of it was before i was when he became too crippled to do much of anything now he sits on the couch all day listening to political youtubers loud enough for me to hear with headphones on from my room across the house heres a list of stuff that he did in the span of months emptied the bathroom trash can all over the floor because no one had taken it out yet during cleaning day cussed out my older sister f when she called him out on that hes always professed to be a christian who hates strong language like that this was the first time he had ever said fuck you to anyone in the house attempted to get me to physically fight him when i called him out on acting like a child and then laughed when i told him he wasnt worth it told my sister that he wants everyone who supports trans people to go to hell this includes all of his kids that still live with him and he later tried to step back saying he didnt mean us mocked me when i tried to calmly give him bible verses that preached against hate forced my mom f to cut contact off with her cousin because he thinks shell cheat on him with the guy this is gonna get more context in the body of the post because there is more information on this called my mother a whore after finding out she sold herself to make sure we could eat when we were toddlers trying to gaslight her into thinking that he didnt refuse to deal with any family finances during that time previously hes also ran off basically every one of his kids from his first marriage except for like including the one that i was actually close to i will give that his distrust of mom with her cousin does not come from out of nowhere they were sexting i know its disgusting none of us approve and he found out about a year and a half ago however he didnt ban her from talking to him then he didnt do that until two weeks ago after he had driven my sister out of the house because of how bad his behavior was specifically because he said that he thought she was planning on leaving him too he has consistently reprimanded my mom for unfaithfulness but all three of us were born while he was still married to his first wife and this entire relationship only started because of an affair he blames her for how long it took to get divorced when he was the one working at the time i want to get out of this house but im only a substitute teacher right now and theres very few career options at the moment we only have one working car two are broken down and one can only really go around town so getting a job outside of town isnt possible yet additionally i live in florida where housing is insanely expensive even above national averages because of how many people come down here to retire as stated earlier my sister tried leaving but she had no money saved up and got fired from the first job she got because her car wasnt clean she got a job as a pizza delivery driver and will likely need to come back here i dont want to repeat the same mistake and leave when i have no money i dont have many irl friends and none of them live in this town except for my brother in law who lives with us so i dont have an out for now any ideas for how to get out of here id need to basically leave the state in order to have a chance of affording a place,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

okay hi reddit this is my first post and its a lot but i need advice i just turned this april and have graduated high school the month after so im on my summer break right now before i start college and major in art to possibly become a ceramicist potter i dont currently have a job right now im trying to get one no ones been hiring or accepting me so its very hard atm but i wanna save up money and move out from my abusive parents and family and live my own life do whatever i want whenever i want and be with whoever i want basically just be free and start a new chapter of my life my parents are very religious people theyre muslim and worship islam and allah but im not so its hard to talk to them about certain things relating to my love life and sexuality im bi and trans but they dont know that im gay and have a boyfriend but they dont know that either if they did i would be homeless another thing to mention is that my parents are also bosnian so even more struggle theyre immigrants and came to america fleeing from the bosnian war that went on and they wanted to build us a life here so here i am they dont really let me go out a whole lot because they dont trust me with things from the past for example i missed some days at school bc i would skip but i still went and finished them catching me sneaking out of my window and house the excuses and lies i would give them and they constantly interrogate me and ask what im doing in my life theyre physically and mentally abusive and ive been having many hurtful evil and inhumane things said about me to my face from them along with some of my other siblings they comment about my appearance say that im not good enough and never will be how ill never meet anyone in life how i wont be successful in the future basically everything there is to say theyve said it to me theyve also said how they shouldve never gave birth to me and how it wouldve been better if i wasnt here my own parents too unbelievable but what can i possibly do about it lol move tf out and leave them for good my older sister turning moved from my parents bc they also found out that she had a boyfriend at the time and she didnt want this life so i helped her take her things out her window and said my goodbyes we still keep in contact and see each other today but she started saving her money when she was and i have some bad spending habits but ive been getting better at it and been realizing my wants and needs theyve cut off contact completely and dont speak or see each other she hasnt seen my parents in years but theyve known where she moved from and where she would go which is really scary and super stalkerish because idk why they care when shes an adult and has her own life with someone else super weird i dont want my parents to find out where my boyfriend lives or where ive been going so they can camp out and stalk me like they have before heres my situation recently i had a fight with my younger sister and our childhood friend who were really close with and theyve said many things about me and how they dont like the things i do like smoking weed with my bf and ive apologized for my mistakes and told them that i would be better from now on theyre not talking to me until theyve seen that ive changed i understand that but what they dont understand is what my boyfriend is like theyve never met him or talked to him once other than the stuff i tell them the good and bad my boyfriend and i have been facing some problems in our relationship recently but we always find a way to thoroughly communicate with each other and try to see what we both need to do better so that we dont make the same mistake again in the future ive been telling them about how i feel about the stuff he does not mentioning bc it doesnt matter but they think its best for us to completely break up and theyve been trying to separate us after weve been dating for over a year and this is the longest relationship ive ever had and the most happy and free ive ever felt from anyone else they think that hes a bad influence and that i can meet someone else in college but i dont wanna breakup and he doesnt either its just not happening with that my parents have been suspicious of me drinking or smoking weed because i went to the movies and took a couple edibles and they saw that i wasnt okay when i felt like i could speak and walk fine i dont have any weed or alcohol on me the only time i smoke weed is when im with my boyfriend and im not with him every day i can only hangout when both my parents are at work or go to a friends and even then i still sneak out and track where they are i can see on my messages where theyre at be you can send your location indefinitely but have to delete it from their recently deleted so they dont know ur tracking them you can track them but they cant track you ive been a lot more safer recently coming home before they do and been taking my car out sometimes because me and my boyfriend dont go on many dates but started to more recently they havent caught me until my younger sister told my mom that i always go out and she also started telling my dad in spite of anger when ive been trying to gain their trust back and have been in good terms with them no problems or suspicions until now since then my parents havent trusted anything i said or where i tell them im going when ive texted called facetimed sent own pictures to them and they still dont believe me all because of my younger sister who snitched my relationship with her is over shes told me how she feels and i told her how i feel but shes so hardheaded and doesnt understand what my life is like and doesnt wanna be in it anymore so ill let her make that choice but when i make a choice everyone gets in my way of it for why when i was at my friends house with her both of them went through my phone which isnt okay at all btw its privacy and basic respect why tf would you go through my phone when i wouldnt do that to you even if i was that upset lifelong childhood friend who i thought i could trust allowing this to happen btw and were looking at the messages between me and my boyfriend and said how disappointed they were in me because they think that i drunk and drove the night of the movies when i tried to explain to them that i didnt and they still didnt believe me i went to his house later that day to try and talk about what were gonna do i came unannounced he was confused and they kept calling me along with my parents asking what i was doing and i almost got hit about three times because i was stressed while driving and told them that the number one cause for crashesdeath when driving is texting and driving not drugs or alcohol or lack of sleep yes they can be contributors but its not the number one cause im also not that dumb enough to drink and drive i can kill myself and others and i know that i dont know why they wont believe me when ive told them the truth about taking too many edibles and how ive apologized and said that i would quit completely im gonna cut back a lot but im not doing it or talking about it around them anymore around anyone my friends smoke too but idk why its a problem when i do it im only trusting myself bc they made me realize that do not trust anyone no matter how much you love them or how long youve known them for because they will stab your back someday just like me im still smoking weed and doing what i want but barely than how much i was doing which wasnt even a lot btw but sure they think im some kind of crack head who has no money and looks for only weed in life when i dont need it at all and can walk away from it i just like how it makes me feel bc its relaxing and calming the only time i dont feel constant pressure and its my decision i dont see a big deal with it when my same friend vapes nicotine and posts tiktoks of her ghosting constantly when i dont do that in her car too but sure yeah im the high one driving dangerously when youve never been in the car with me and when you constantly vape and are with your boyfriend too i know that theyre worried for me and dont want me to get hurt or get a dui and go to jail but ive never drove high once and ive felt fine the whole time im a really good driver and my boyfriend agrees i took a driving class and know how to be safe on the road im not an imbecile after that i turned back around and went home my younger sister took my keys away from me threw a water bottle and spilt it all over my face yelling and crying and we had a talk later that night which she walked away from she said she doesnt know what to do anymore and i told her the same thing she wants me to go back to being the old me but people change and ive changed i love myself now more than ever not the past version of myself like people say the past stays in the past only focus on the present and future people are so worried about the past and future nobody really takes time to appreciate the present just slow down and live life to its fullest youre not in a rush and dont ever make yourself or anyone rush you recent situation i was hanging out with my boyfriend this morning because we go to this store every tuesday with cheap stuff they open at am but the line starts forming around am but i go to my boyfriends house before so i can see him and his dogs for a little bit before i leave my mom starts calling me around am asking me where i was she had to take my dad to work and i told her i was at the store but ofc she doesnt believe me and says that shes gonna go and see if im in there i quickly rush out and start driving trying to beat her he lives min away from me but about away from the store and i made it in line and she facetimes me i answer and she asks me to show her and i showed her and she believed me when i was about three away she was six and it was really scary because i didnt want her to see me on the road my bf met up with me later my mom never came to see if i was there but she came later before i left to give me money to put into my bank account bc i recently broke my phone and had to use my own money to pay for a new one but they didnt know until a couple days before she told me to go to the bank and go home after and that she would call my sister to make sure i was home at i went to chick fil a to eat breakfast with my bf and then went to the bank and to a thrift store across from us he left his car at chick fil a so i thought i could drive him because i checked where my mom was at and it said that she was at work she works at this was around but she was in the parking lot at the thrift store waiting for me and saw my boyfriend get out of my car she called me and was yelling telling me to come over there and we had about a minute talk in the parking lot about life and shit which i couldnt wait to get over i was freaking out we were both crying and she was telling me how she wanted to be nice and just have a good relationship with me but i go out and do this stuff to her and make her sick she had breast cancer last year but is healthy now and blamed it on me saying that i caused it on her and if im trying to kill her she asked if he was my boyfriend and why he was in my car i told her that i didnt know him and he just asked me if he could have a ride because he didnt have a car on him and i said sure because i wanted to do something nice when no one else would and he had a foot injury which he actually did she said that she understands that but i shouldnt take people in my car other than my sister when ive been driving for over a year and have had my license since october but ok months of having my full license and i still cant take anyone around but my little sister lmfaoo little do they know she said that she was gonna go inside and take a picture of him to send my dad he left before she went in there thank god a guy he knew drove him back to his car and my mom didnt see him again i think she was saying that to threaten me and that she didnt actually mean it bc i told her that she could go ahead lol its not like it matters bc idk him anyways and that he knows where i am at all times but doesnt wanna tell me how if i wanna move to just tell them and leave how she wants me to find a bosnian man and marry him most of them suck and have the same morals like my parents and cheat a lot and i already have someone in my life and how if she saw me dating that man in public she would rather see me in the ground on my deathbed than with him yes you heard that right my own mother who gave birth to me said that she would rather commit suicide than see her own child with a white american man she said she would rather kill herself than see us two together and when i heard that it fucking broke everything in me imagine hearing that from your mother looking right in her eyes too she asked me if i was lying and to swear on her life that i wasnt seeing him and i swore on her life and mine and i think she finally believed me she kept saying how she feels like im just covering up making some kind of story because im beautiful and how i need to find someone in the future and she said okay go home dont let this happen again after all of this nobody likes me being with my boyfriend when he tries to be there for me when he can but he knows how my parents are like and has apologized multiple times and wishes that i could live a normal life away from them and be with him and his family but i cant because i have a younger sister and brother to take care of and they wouldnt have anybody but themselves if i were to leave everyone is dependent on me when i try so hard to be independent and live my own life without anyone getting in the way of it but they still do no matter how hard i try im getting so exhausted and drained for having to live my whole life in pure fear and survival like when do i get to finally be happy and free and do what i want and come home and eat whenever i want have my own job and be a tattoo artist get an apprenticeship for that and actually start living my life why do people constantly have to make these decisions for me when i know myself better than anyone else and whats good for me my parents think that all the stuff i like rock heavy metal cowboys and westerns music ss rap clothes piercings tattoos are all satanic devil worshipping things even though its not but theyre too dumb to realize i cant even wear a crop top without being called a slut before i leave the house in one hundred degree weather but when someone with a smaller chest wears one its fine because its socially accepted and normalized but when i do it its not okay and im called a slut for it its so unfair and i cant keep getting mistreated and beat down in my young adulthood my best years i know that people are just trying to look out and want the best for me but going about it this way is so toxic and makes me fall heavier on depression everyone looking through my stuff my mom finding my empty flask of liquor that i drank from long before my cart my sex toys thongs lingerie all of it even when i clean my room she loves to dig for any secrets ive been keeping to find some reason to kick me out have one less mouth to feed i feel like nobody has been wanting me in their lives and feel like everything is my fault and that im the cause of it all when everyone else is living their life with no problems or theyre at least not thinking they did or caused anything onto me when theyre at fault too and im waiting for an apology back not to mention but i had a year anniversary post on my insta and they were texting saying how upset and betrayed they felt that i would choose him over them even though its not true and ive said that i didnt mean it to spite against them and i can see how it mightve come across that way they thought i was ignoring them but i didnt wanna read their messages bc i had so much on my mind and wasnt ready and i apologized i was originally planning to move out next summer so that i could get my first year of college done with and get used to my schedule and campus i have my whole first year payed for and i would be paying out of pocket for textbooks meals student loans etc in december i have a month long break where ill be working the whole time trying to save up i could move that monthsemester but i wanna try and get my first year of school done so i know how things work and am more familiar my dad sister and i had a long discussion about his plans for the future and he says that in four years hes taking my mom and brother and moving back to bosnia leaving me and my younger sister here ill be in my third year of college my sister will be a freshman in college and my brother will be a freshman in high school and my dad said that hes willing to give my sister and i the house because he knows that apartments are really expensive and how its dangerous living beside a bunch of strangers and how we were born and raised here so he more than understands and will give it to us to decorate however we want and to do whatever we want wed have our own garage backyard pool rooms etc that would be in or and i dont know if i can wait that long just to get a house with someone who i dont wanna live with just to get a year out of it paying for cheaper bills theres just no point in making my parents wait when my sister wouldnt wanna live with me by then and my parents wanting to take the money from selling the house if i go my first year at college and get financial aid and have my parents pay for the second year i could move out that summer and they wouldnt even have to know were planning on going to bosnia next year i think so that could be our last family trip together i could probably have a car by then my sister gets her full license in marchapril but idk if the title will be in my name bc i asked my dad about that and he said the only people who ask that question are people who wanna move out i have a car but its in my dads name so its technically his but if i dont i can get my own or drive my boyfriends car i dont know the first step of moving out if you have abusive narcissistic hypocritical parents like me or understand anything about how much you should have saved up what to look out for getting your own car transferring banks transferring mail addresses getting a credit card getting a new phone plan etc any advice would help should i move out this year or next year before things escalate and get worse i cant stay four years i know its better financially but i know that i cant hold out that long with the past trauma i already have i love my boyfriend so much and he wants to help me in every way to try and get me away from lifelong abuse and trauma i know that im young and it might be too soon moving in with him but i know that he would take the best care of me as i would do for him and wed have everything figured out and properly planned even if we run along problems later down the way well figure it out together and we made a promise to stay together and not leave each other for someone else as dumb as it is i love him and would do anything for him and he would do the same i could move in with his parents for a while until we find our own place or i could stay with his grandma or we can get an rvtrailer and live in there for a couple of months maybe we can build our own house in his backyard bc he has a smoke spot for himself so i have options ill have a roof above my head i only have about on me right now and i know it isnt enough to move out but im starting somewhere and ill have a thousand before hopefully at least k i move out since ill be getting a job soon he has way more money than i have and comes from a supportive family so if i told them my situation they would understand and try to help me since i have a good relationship with them and they like me they also have a family owned business and could get me a job right away id get paid more than i have before with my mom says that shes gonna ask my dad to retrieve all my phone numbers and messages and ask who ive been texting and calling when idk if he can check my messages but i know he can see my numbers would he still be able to check my messages if my carrier is tmobile or are they saying that just to threaten me if i changed my phone plan would they be able to know like get notified or something can they actually track my phone and see where i am at all times or are they lying about that too just another threat that i shouldnt take seriously or should i start taking them seriously i know a lot of parents say that as a threat but cant actually do it but my parents are very smart so idk if theyre lying about that or not my boyfriend and i have told people that were breaking up bc we know thats what everyone wants but were just taking a break from each other for a couple of months and keeping things on the downlow so that nobody suspects anything were

im going to tell what happened to me f because i no longer wish to cover up for anyone all my life i suffered verbal and physical abuse from my mother she blamed me because according to her when i was born her exhusband showed his claws and began to mistreat her i tried to help her the best i could believing that once we were alone everything would be different but it wasnt like that she blamed me for making her report him and would get furious with me for no reason saying i had promised her she would be happy without him after a painful breakup with an abusive man similar to my mother i decided i didnt want to live like that for the rest of my life then i met a man m who seemed good knowing about the abuse he proposed living with himand his parents his father kept to himself but his mother was very intrusive all our arguments were about her never our relationship one day after an incident with his mother he raised his fist at me while driving and accelerating a car that wasnt even his but his mothers it was traumatic he always said i had traumas because of my mother but he generated that trauma in me my heart broke because the man who was supposedly loving and protecting me had the intention to hurt me the worst part is he blamed me for everything he insists hes not violent that ive pushed him to the limit im still affected and cry every time i remember it im no longer with him i live with a friend and dont have the problems i had at his mothers house i wasnt the problem its true i need to heal but he has serious problems as well i dont want him back i just want to heal to have a good relationship claude can make mistakes please doublecheck responses,Positive

note im mother or smth my older sister is younger brother is ive been confused recently and its just the situation i was placed under and how it is altering events recently i tried to commit due to my mothers outburst as she destroyed everything i had including my clothes my art and my items within my room this was all because of me being myself in dressing the way i wanted to note that in the past she has been aggressive and abusive including starving me calling me a whre or any other derogatory terms she never loved me and always told me i was never part of this family so i decided to do her a favor and remove myself permanently i was on the verge of overdose and i tried my hardest to just pass out but i decided to talk to my counselor that i was going to commit leading me to the doctors trying to take the toxins out of me when they were allowed to visit no one came besides my aunt who was there and said if my mother did not accept me as her daughter she was always there for the first time i realized my mother never treated me like her own child like she treated her other two other children my mother did eventually come but all she did was tell me that it was my fault for being here and she shouldve just talked it out when i had the chance and she was not really that mad she only said that because she did not want to cause a huge fuss over what happened in front of everyone it was so fake i believed it though cause i just wanted closure even if it was fake i ended up going to the phyceward for a stay but when i was gone it got worse my brothers noted that i called her a btch for the longest time as if they never said told her that when i was there she did try her hardest to get me out of that situation and put me on track because they were thinking about putting me there longer knowing that made me feel like she might be ok and accept me but when i got out i was ready to meet them all it was like this wash of reality that i did not know them and it all seemed clear that it was just fake talk for a while to make me feel safe but in reality it was not she made it clear that i am not her daughter and i do not address her as a mother she made me apologize to her about the lack of respect but not once did i hear her say sorry for the torture and abuse she put me through she made me starve beat me around till i bled forced me to separate from my grandparents and forced me to not have friends bc she was scared i would go around and tell there is more to that list but those were the only things i wanted her to know that she did to me no she wants an apology for the circumstance she put me through and i needed a release of anger and took it out like that she is no mother she is some monster i deal with sure she may have given me all this but at what cost she did this to herself and now i am turned out like this all at her expense its worse now my siblings have separated from me because its too much for them to handle when i talk about my mother and tell me to go get therapy when i was in that phyceward they promised me itd get better and be there for me when i was out they isolated me shut the door off and went out with their friends and did not even talk to me once because i had to learn a lesson its been harsh and i gave up on this entire family and already accepted that i am no longer part of this family all i want is peace and be able to live freely so im planning on leaving next year and never looking back at them ive been lashing out in anger now at them and i dont know how to control it when i see them they get me so annoyed and disgusted ive been putting guilt on for just existing but now i want to understand if my anger is justified now or am i being dramatic am i even allowed to give up on them or should i still try my older sister is offering therapy but complains she needs to save up i dont even know anymore im so lost in what to do with this family and how to be a part of it if theirs even a chance,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

im writing this because i need to know that i am not the only person who is living it its hard for me to open up but i finally reached to this point where i need to hear others opinions my dad left when i was very young my mom developed a rare neurological condition that almost paralysed and killed her theres no cure for this illness and its very progressive that was years ago ever since my dad left my mom needed financial support and the only way she was able to get it was through the help of her brother a very controlling inconsiderate hurtful person who never let us live throughout those years my moms mental health was getting worse she started abusing pills and smoking cigarettes in insane amounts of course she was spending the money where it shouldnt be spent my dad lived with his parents and was secretly married his family always pushed us away to a point where they actually cut us off completely of course my dad never stood up for us back then so we were very much involved in my mothers family because again her illness is progressive it got worse and worse recently we spent the past years of our life in hospitals and er saving her life because she has now multiple illnesses of course our health was and still is neglected and our needs were never addressed the focus was always on saving her life she is very unhealthy doesnt have a basic understanding about her illness and doesnt chose what is best for it she is that self destructive shes disabled and cant be left on her own me and my siblings put our lives education and future on hold to be able to save her but her brother sees otherwise he keeps blaming us controlling us and holds us in to not do anything ever that would take us away from them he knows that she is irresponsible but keeps feeding her self destruction and whenever it goes wrong we get abused for it years of inconsideration years of neglect and control years forced to take all of the responsibility years of not even being able to express thoughts or opinions because we grew up tip toeing intimidated and living under the mercy of people who dont know logic and so many other details im so scared of traumas i will be finding out about later on if i ever get the chance or the space to take care of myself,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im and my mother was horrible in the sense she put herself and her children through immense stress and trauma for making bad decisions i grew up listening to their fights with my step father anxiously aware of when her attitude had change even slightly and spending the rest of the day having to deal wirh her and knowing she was going to blow up with me or my father and later with me as you can imagine this is just the tip they luckily never were physically abusive but i wish they had been instead of everything else they did im a hermit i have no social life no hobbies no life plan or goal i began contemplating suicide from early adolescence and i lived life waiting to die because i just couldnt picture my life changing for the better with the years this issued have just compounded and my mothers attitude changed she has read a lot of spirituality of the soul the journey the psychology of letting go of the hurt to grow stronger and a bunch of other shit all basically leading up to now where she sends me video after video after tiktok after tiktok all about your parents did what they could but now you are older and you need to see they werent so bad and find a job all while avoiding the fact im fucked up in ways that make it impossible for me to just man up like she so pushes me to do ive had fights with her for for a decade by now about this i wish i could leave here that i could find a job but i get panic attacks from just being in public spaces and simple arguments and discussions make me so weak that i start to tremble and sweat but she never stops gaslighting me that everybody has anxiety they just deal with it and go to work i just wish i could say something to change this situation if i could id live in s shoe box just to get away from his house,Positive

i was raised in an upper middle class household i never had to really worry about money when i was younger so i always felt i was blessed around th grade my father began to show signs of mental health deterioration he was an alcoholic and always in a terrible mood he wasnt too physical with me unless it was for normal parental discipline but it was an absolute pain to be around him he would often fake punch me when i walk past him like a fucking kid and one time he got me on my nose and naturally i got mad at him and instead of apologizing or anything at all he yelled at me for yelling at him i would rarely ever even attempt to talk to him on a daily basis because it would always end in him getting angry and staring angrily deep into my soul and trying to belittle me the most annoying example is when i would try to give him advice it was like a fucking sin for me to try to give this dude advice since i was a kid and he was an adult it really pissed me off when it would smoke he would smoke packs of cigs a day and then come inside and start kissing my dog it made me stay away from my dog because then they would both end up wreaking of cigarette smoke one time i asked him if he could maybe wash his hand and rinse his mouth after smoking before touching the dog after i worded it kindly with a positive tone and wasnt being confrontational and he flipped out on me and made it such a big deal saying that it was disrespectful for me to tell him to change something he was doing this stuff got really bad during covid but sort of in a different sense my dad stopped antagonizing me i think its because i had a pretty big growth spurt and i was putting on a decent amount of muscle so he couldnt intimidate me like he used to so he basically stopped communicating with me all together we lived in the same house for about two years straight without a full conversation this was so fucking weird i almost would have rather been yelled at than this we would still see each other around the house but he would just stare me down without a word as almost as if he were trying to intimidate me i would always try to avoid him around the house sometimes i would wake up and not go downstairs on weekends to avoid him and just listen through my door and wait for him to leave or go somewhere during covid i would either stay in my room or the basement for multiple days at a time only coming out for food and water my parents got divorced literally right when i turned i dont even care about the implications behind this but this is when my real depression started i was already riddled with anxiety before the stuff with my dad and that stuff just made it much worse and then going to college on top of all of this had me in a terrible place i thought about my relationship with my parents a lot during this time and started to think that i was the problem i would rationalize my fathers actions thinking that he was just really depressed and upset that nobody was helping him with it thus causing him to resent his family the sad part is that the only reason i even thought that maybe thats what he is going through is because that is how i started to feel i love my mother but i also always resented her for never caring about my mental health ever since i was a little kid i had these anxious tics where i would scrunch my face uncontrollably my mother would always yell at me for this my father surprisingly didnt care or even acknowledge this like ever she was call it a bad habit that i needed to stop and i always wanted to tell her that i couldnt control it i learned over time to not do it in public but still to this day im now and a rising senior in college i do it when im alone sometimes now for the resolution of this long ass post the mixing of memories once my father left im at the time and a freshmen in college it was just my mom and my sister i was super depressed and i remember i would either act out and be super bland and whenever i was home for breaks i didnt realize this at the time but i believe i did this as a way to try to get my mom to acknowledge anything about my mental health i started smoking weed in the house the summer after freshman year of college this was a pretty strict house and i had never once ever even so much as cursed out loud so this finally made her say something but this kind of upset me even more because all she did was suggest i go to therapy the thing is my mother seems to care a lot about me at times she makes sure i am fed well she works her ass off to help pay the interest for my tuition and cooks me nice meals every once in a while and it makes me feel like such an asshole to resent her i still love her so much but i cant really tell if i am truly wrong for this i didnt read this post over so i hope it even makes sense also this is my first reddit post ever an i have never told anyone about my family life not even any of my closest friends i didnt even talk to my mother about feelings immediately after the divorce and it was treated like any other day i feel like im losing my mind sometimes keeping all this shit in i feel like my friends wont take it seriously if i tell them i mean there are so many other kids who are beaten by their parents and have no money and i feel like shit when this stuff makes me depressed am i crazy,Positive
to give background i got a lease with my mother in a two bedroom apartment when we first got it both of our names were required to be on the lease agreement a year later i got into law school i left late august and the lease was up in october when that time rolled around she begged me to sign for another year so i did i came back for christmas break and everything was fine when i came home for summer she moved someone into my room this individuals name is not on the lease and is a ex felon when i came home all of my stuff was gone through and multiple things were unaccounted for since being home my mother and i have been arguing most every night i dont like my stuff being touched but that keeps happening the individual is up at all hours keeping me awake and when i get upset about it they both act like i am dramatic basically my mom says nothing and lets him run the house and do whatever he wants i have started a job at the airport and have crazy hours and need my sleep but he will be up cooking steak at in the morning they are both great at playing the victim something that blew my mind was i was woken up and the grwn man had his mother come over and have my mother and i talk things out i did not ask for this and did not say she can move this in in my legal binding contract she claims its to help her get on her feet with finances but she does not work all but two days a month i feel disrespected and uncomfortable in my own house i dont know what to do they are good at making me seem crazy in their minds i should work crazy hours while they sit around all day and all night and do whatever they want including dealing with a smell of a strong burning substance that filtrates through the whole houseand i should keep my mouth shut my food and drinks are also always being taken and eaten my car was also stolen a few days after coming home so i have been working hard to get myself another car so money is tight right now now again i dont know what to do im trapped until august i also dont think it is healthy to continue a relationship with my mother because not only has this situation put a strain on my relationship with her i have caught signs of drugs she has put me in a situation that i dont think any mother should do she has defended him and sided with him she has put me in a situation where if the complex finds out i can be in some serious trouble but she doesnt think about me but him first she almost got us evicted from this apartment for refusing to work and pay rent and i dont think they would hesitate to kick all of us out if they found out which means i could not get an apartment to head back to law school i think what she is doing is selfish and if she knew she could not afford it she should not have renewed this lease i am constantly told by her to go to hell to go fuck myself etc any advice or comments are appreciated also i am starting to lose my temper,Neutral
i went no contact with my parents last year after my mother went on a tirade because she was jealous of other people in my life there were good moments with my parents in my childhood but also a lot of bad and scary moments my mom is an alcoholic most likely narcissistic or bpd and my dad has anger issueslow emotions my mom was obsessed with me she would say she was jealous of boyfriends for being able to touch me friends etc she has tried to blackmail me in the past she kicked me out once because i told her i couldnt come see her during my college finals there was also an element of sexual abuse but i am trying to be vague so its not too obvious my mom texted me again today asking me if there is any hope for our relationship i think she desperately wants a relationship with me but every time in the past that ive tried it has ended badly the second i set boundaries she loses it and claims i cant hold things from the past against her my heart breaks to know she is hurting i dont want that and i think everyday about the pain its the last thing i want but i do not think it is healthy for me to be around her being around her puts me on edge my nervous system still reacts to her as it did when i was a childundergoing the abuse im so much happier and healthier the last year of my life and the only thing that changed was removing them has anyone ever reconciled and it actually worked how did you know you were ready,Neutral

im beginning to realize some of this stuff isnt normal the root seems to be my parent i am a male in my teens and my parent is a good kind man but hes often angry and says and does stuff sometimes that i now realize he shouldnt do somewhat unpredictable for example i remember him giving my little brother a nosebleed by a punch or picking me up by the shirt and pinning me against the wall hes also said some stuff like we both are good at using charm to get what we want out of others i didnt think to much of it at the time and other stuff like threatening to break legs or jab us in the throat this stuff has made me a very apathetic and cold person causing me to hurt animals and sometimes people due to my very strong impulsei know i am a terrible person i just need to put this here before i delete this account i have parental controls on my phone so who knows what might happen but back to the title sometimes my brothers my dad and me will joke about killing the dog my little sister loves by leaving her out in the street or just killing her in some other way she is very sensitive and cares a lot about animals i just realized that this is hurting her and every time she complains about we all tell her to be quiet and stop being sensitive i realize that this is a very evil thing to say now i do not feel bad for this but i realize this is wrong i know i am not a great brother i dont need to be told this i am honestly looking for some form of reassurance im not sure am i lying to myself this stuff is normal to me,Positive
i wish i was exaggerating but yes today years of breeding propagating plants and thousands of dollars has all gone to waste because my mom thought my room smelled bad i owned fish tanks all bigger than gallons stocked with every type of fish you can imagine i had recently gotten a new set of cory catfish for from a breeder my mom really didnt like them because of their whiskers so i think that fueled some of it today i went to school and came home to empty fish tanks and some broken glass i screamed and ran to my mom asking her what happened she told me she just cleared up my room for me and i should be thankful all fish including my foot long catfish were flushed my plants and coral were thrown away and my fish tanks broken no i cant just start again because some fish are hybrids you wouldnt find anywhere else,Neutral

im new here and ive been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now i grew up in an asian household that took education and grades very seriously i was punished or demeaned whenever i did something bought home a slightly lower grade or perhaps did something that my mother wasnt very fond of no matter how small i open the fridge for a second i get nagged at dont leave the fridge open what the hell is wrong with you youre adding to my already high electricity bill as an example however whenever i do accomplish something i dont recall ever being praised for it ive always been ignored whenever i did something my mother wanted me to accomplish get a job okay i got a job but its not enough because im not making enough money to her standards i tried so hard to get a sense of recognition from her shes told me several times to kill myself because i didnt want to go to college or that i was a horrible useless person for choosing community college she wanted me to go to a prestigious university i worked my ass off at community college took credits and obtained my associate degree within a year because she didnt want me to stay at community college i ended up getting accepted to my dream school also the school my mom wanted me to attend i also applied and ended up getting a scholarship worth k basically giving me a full ride scholarship to any university in the us and guess what no recognition no congratulations nothing just yeah thats expected of you despite the fact she insisted on me going to college in the first place it just seems like nothing i do is enough to her no matter what i do i feel empty despite my successes in life i still feel worthless and all that ive accomplished is done for nothing she never showed up to my graduations either due to commitments to work because she needed money i should feel happy for myself i should feel grateful for all that ive accomplished but no i feel nothing i feel empty alone and sad i recently got a summer internship that pays k a week which would add up to a k annual salary but it still means nothing to her she doesnt care tldr no matter how much i accomplish my mom doesnt and never will give a shit about anything i do,Positive

dont know if this is the right place to say this but i have a really shitty experience to write about here from age literally to im guessing around years old really cannot remember how or when it stopped my parents specially my mom abused is what i would interpret it as on paper me and my sibling nah not a few slaps in the face twice a year mom had mental health issues and serious stress and i guess ended up taking out most of it on my sibling and i in the form of excessive scolding get pissed off at everything beating up throwing stacks of books on us and just you can guess the rest a little scary part is that i only have fragments of vivid memories from this period of time and my dad from what i can remember never even once tried to stop his wife from beating his kids just watched silently with a blank look on his face still remember that look although i dont neccesarily feel anything about it just ah right okay thats how it is not disappointed just okay fast forward years later probably by the time i was none of my parents really hit me or anything anymore i dont remember feeling relieved i wasnt even doubtful or scared in the first place because that was all i ever knew from my house hold i realised that my parents actually grew to be kind thoughtful and supportive people fuck i dont know how to explain this my mom would express guilt and apology to us as we were kids as if that meant anything to us we didnt even recognise it as abuse back then now when sometimes that comes to topic my mom plays victim by basically bringing up how mentally she was struggling that time thats fine i wont protest because i dont want to discuss this ever with her but i cant help but find myself in a rare state mad that my parentss abused my sibling and i not because it left me with a permanent emotional scar not because it damaged a fundamental period of growth in my life as a person but because right now they look so happy my dad and my mom theyre so happy and in love right now and its not like that doesnt make me smile but on the back of my head i think like so you guys can just seem so genuinely happy after comitting such sin just dont understand the guilt mechanism here like how do yall live w yourself bruh thats crazy moms always a victim because of how much health issues she has i get it let it be so but i sometimes want to let them know whatever hapiness they have right now is not deserved id normally say deep down i just want to talk to my parents about it and get myself a proper apology i think they would and get it over with but no not really i dont want to talk i dont want an apology i dont want no heartfelt reconcile thing i will forgive but its too late to forget their abuse shaped me into something i hate to be and while i deal with that they get to enjoy the rest of their lives next to the love of their life how unfair how unjust but thats how i tell myself it is what it is,Positive

for some context im an adult f who hasnt lived with my abusive dad since i entered my s however i still have to see him every few months for the usual holidays and every time it just fills me with dread my dad is not a good person but someone who is incredibly good at putting on the front of being caring and compassionate when it works in his favor he has self admitted to doing incredibly nasty and awful behaviors inorder to manipulate people so he can keep them in his life and abuse them without using the words manipulate or abuse of course but acts like any of the same behaviors directed at me are just simple overreactions or misunderstandings so i know he is a compulsive liar on top of that he has mentally physically and sexually abused multiple people at this point including minors and at one point i was so scared of him that i sincerely thought he would kill me so i moved out and never went back to living with him but despite all of that i have now distanced myself from him greatly and only see him a handful of times a year and i just cant bring myself to cut him off theres a few reasons i suspect for this like him making life harder for siblings him attempting to stalk me him trying to make my divorced mothers life harder him threatening to commit suicide or even actually committing suicide but in any other situation like this i would still highly encourage someone and probably would have already left without looking back why is it so insanely hard to do this with parents especially abusive ones we know just absolutely suck as people why do i have to worry so much about him retaliating it feels like im playing house with an abuser and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about especially know everything hes done up to this point if anyone here has cut off a parent like this any input would be so greatly appreciated im tired of being stuck in this loop with him i want him so badly out of my life but feel so mortified at the idea of actually removing him and dont have a clue how to do it as safely as possible i dont even introduce my partner to this man because i dont want them to ever even speak to him,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
and sometimes feel as if im stuck in my year old self react to things the same way depressive mood swings no trust in anyone older than me i despise them beyond words but every day im fed the same bullshit of they didnt starve you and you had an education why are you complaining im this close to leaving everything behind and working at an oil rig or something even if my health makes it life threatening,Neutral

so this situation is currently in motion and is being worked on and the end is near as im typing this so i should start from the beginning i guess so me m and my f gf started dating in february of this year currently but starting talking in december of and back then i asked about her parents and always heard very little about them when the parents conversation was brought up but when we started dating she really opened up to me about her situation and i should add that currently its not just her in danger but its also her little brother m that is living with this but anyway i dont know where to start with just her dad alone m so in late february when we were like two weeks into dating we were gonna tell them and then they found out anyway and he wasnt that mad but questioned me about it obviously and i explained to him what our situation was that we only just started dating and i would like to meet him and her mother and discuss all of this which we did and all was fine until she started telling me that they both have called her a whore a bitch a slut and words like that and ive heard this first hand and they both have put there hands on her multiple times including slapping her choking her and kicking her into her room most of this stuff happened around the ages and still continues today occasionally but she mostly is being called slurs consistently and here comes the more disgusting and sexual abusetendencies part of this cluster fuck so in mid to late april we had a pregnancy scare and we tried to hide it because we knew they would kill us both but they ended up finding out and her dad as we expected lost his mind he started trashing the house and as soon as he found out he put his hands around her throat and called whore as usual and then the worst part comes up after he did that he then made her sit down and tell him exactly how we had sex what position we did it in how long it lasted and if she had a orgasm or not and in the past she has had a series of different encounters with him involving stuff that seems to be a sexual manner such as her taking a shower and him walking in and ripping the curtain open and looking her up and down for several minutes she asked him for privacy and he told her no and i dont know if this is worth anything but in march at the time i was in georgia i live in arizona i was visiting my sister as she just moved out and me and my gf were talking and she texted me pictures of her and the whole family in car and his phone connected to the car and started playing double penatration porn not to mention as i said the little brother was in the car but thats just a little fraction in this shitcicle but recently she was allowed to spend time over here at my house and she got a call from her dad asking her what time she was coming home and she said probably around pm and he started saying that he doesnt know his daughter anymore and shes always out of the house and shes no longer allowed over there there being my house and needs to be home no later then so then i took her home and a few hours go by and then my dad gets a text from her dad that was along the lines of you people are taking my daughter away from me and turning her against me and manipulating her and encouraging her to run away and then my mom got really really mad at this situation and called him and i should add my girlfriend tells me and my family everything she really trusts us but anyway my mom called him out on all of this she called him out on the threats to separate us and the calling his daughter a whore which he admitted too and said she deserves it and the abuse in the past and he spoke in a calm tone through out all of it while my mom was screaming at him and after that my gf has been looking into emancipation because she has self harm scars from this situation and and she has openly admitted she cant do it anymore and is considering suicide or running away but here where some hope shines in my dad at his work has met a person who specializes in foster careemancipation for kids and is helping us through this entire situation and we have told him about most of the stuff going on and he really believes we have a case but it goes way deeper than just emotionalphysical and possible sexual abuse he did a background check on her dad and found he is a former felon and has currently multiple different alias and has a confirmed name change but also but thats not even the start of it for some reason i had to add a pole idk why view poll,Positive

to start after what happened between us and the the type of person my mom is it makes sense for her to get it covered up ive recently come to terms that my mom is not my mom anymore and as much as i should not give a fuck i feel my inner child sobbing to summon up our conflict my mom was in an abusive relationship for ongoing years me and my three younger sisters had to witness and endure my stepdadsyounger sisters fatherabuse when i got to an age where i was aware of what was going on and how wrong it was i started standing up for my mom my sisters and myself long story short my mom didnt like that and we spent the last four years on and off during that time my mom went actually crazy and instead of protecting us became another abuser she was my first fightweve had four physical fights ive reported her three times to dcfs and the first two social workers absolutely horrid after my mom had fought my at the time fifteen year old sister as a forty five year old grown ass woman i called again with a verrrrry small sliver of hope and we hit the fucking jackpot our social worker believed us and supported us with so much care my grandparents now have temporary custody of my three younger sisters and my mom and my sisters dad have scheduled and monitored meeting and talking times it would take way too long for me to get into the detail of the abuse and the effects of it today im just giving some background of why im here rn ik that some may not believe me or see me as a spoiled ungrateful kid i have to find the time and mindfulness to unpack those memories im gone and keep yapping too much so im just going to say believe me or not i know what i went through damn after all that i lowkey feel better lol but ik im still gonna feel hurt over it i dont want to just think abt the bad times to feel better but to acknowledge and work on healing that part of myself because im getting older i want to grow and heal from the past and move forward in a different light i just want to ask those who have been in similar situations what are some ways youve helped heal your inner child,Neutral

the abuse has been more emotional for a while more manipulating and my parents playing the victim it usually happens during arguments which i have so much trouble with ive been told stand up for yourself dont let them manipulate you but standing up for myself only leads to more trouble my mom usually asks how are my actions badhow do they effect you sarcastically and it frustrates me so much because shes only going to deny that she did any of itthat it hurt me in any way which yeah because you know exactly what hurts me and what doesnt how are you gonna treat someone bad and then act oblivious to what you did anyways im not sure if i should stand up for myself and make a billionth attempt to express how mentally damaging this all is for me or just do what im doing now let them yell at me while just silently standing there it just seems like theres no point they never listen but stand up for yourself is the only advice i ever get,Neutral

hear me out i love this woman but i cant stand her anymore i love her for all the sacrifices she has made for me i love her for paying for my education even when it wasnt easy for her i appreciate every single thing she has done for me to get me to where i am today what i dont understand is why she thinks its okay for her to remind me of all she has done every time she does something wrong and i call her out for it i had a very shitty childhood her and my dad got divorced got back together and then got divorced again every time i have an argument with her she blames the divorce on me even though i had nothing to do with it im right now i have developed severe social anxiety and often times i sink deep into really depressive thoughts because her and my dad dragged me into their fights ever since i was or something i saw everything and i mean everything things you shouldnt show a child even on a screen they made me watch it that shit traumatized me i sometimes even had panic attacks cause i worried about them fighting so much that it made me feel sick ofcourse it wouldve had some sort of lasting impact on me its only natural but now she calls me names for just simply being upset over something shell say things like she cant enjoy anything herself so she wants to ruin it for others too look at her its impossible for her to be happy they ruined annual holidays for me cause the only memories i have from those holidays are of them fighting and screaming while the rest of my family celebrated downstairs but i was forced to sit and watch no shit im depressed now but im doing everything i can i work a job i hate so i can help her with bills but she doesnt see any of my efforts idk why she does this to me its so exhausting im sick of forgiving her over and over and over i have tried every recipe in the book i have tried talking to her in all manners possible its impossible for my words to reach her no matter how many times i say them she knows exactly what to say to me to hurt me such as telling me that i ended up just like my father i know its not black and white and shes not a bad person but this one aspect of her is killing me every day and idk how much longer i can hold on i have never cared about what people say but when something like this comes from your own mother it hits different she should be the one to understand why i turned out the way i did better than anyone the worst part is everytime something like this happened everytime she fought with my father my brother ran away and only came back when things calmed down he always avoided everything while i was forced to make sure nothing escalated naturally he turned out confident social and mixes well with people while im the opposite which again is something i get blamed for by my mother a few days ago she told me how shes so glad that my brother didnt end up being damaged goods like his sister that shes so glad she protected him as if i wasnt worth protecting when i asked her this she said well its just your luck that you were born first and a girl its different for girls idk anymore i really dont i feel like theres no point in anything no point in trying no point in holding on i just want to kill myself so i dont have to deal with her words anymore its not just her my dad has a cycle of abuse as well but theres only so much info i can fit into one post so for now ill leave it i cant afford therapy right now and i dont have any friends who i can talk to or any other figure in my life this is why im posting this here im sure many of the things people might suggest are things ive already done but i just wanted to let this out in the world,Positive
i f high masking asd have a mother f who constantly verbally and emotionally abused my father f silencing him talking under his hearing level he is mostly deaf and basically everyone was treading on eggshells my entire childhood she also had a repetitive dialogue about the burden of men that they never helpful and are useless and stupid this affected my brother a lot i clashed with her in my teens but am aware that i before and after adolescence have learned to people please keep the peace and try to be liked by everyone so i have social currency to change the atmosphere now in my own relationships i see the same behaviours and temper come out in me i feel rage resentment loneliness and despair in my current relationship hes a great guy m ive never been in love like this and he is almost too patient but he doesnt work hes insecure and a little immature and after months of great mutual support i started to find myself belittling him being quick to anger snapping not wanting to be touchedintimate and feeling frustrated its now a year in its been getting worse and yesterday i asked him if he was falling out of love with me and he said he was scared of me that shame really hit me hard ive been pretty shut down since suicidal thoughts at the forefront hes walking on eggshells and it broke me my previous pattern and strong urge now is to break up with him to stop exposing evil self to people and accept i cant in good conscience let anyone get close to me ive had a good amount of therapy but im still not healed im still repeating my mothers behaviour and i guess im hear to ask if theres hope for me or should i just give up on relationships altogether has anyone else had this experience is there hope for me to manage this should i just leave to spare him,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
it has been years since ive lived with him full time and over a year since ive lived in a different city im now but the way my adoptive dad who i will b calling my step dad cuz i am uncomfortable calling him dad has treated me in my teenage years still haunts me and causes me to be very short tempered with him and has given me very unhealthy reactions to things my biggest problem is he doesnt think he has ever done anything wrong enough to constitute an apology i talked to him a little over a year ago and i said i was waiting for him to apologize for how he treated me when i was and he basically said he has nothing to be sorry for and while he has changed a lot in the last few years i dont rlly believe the progress has been enough to warrant me changing my views on him for context he was raised super religiousstrict and is a bit of an unspoken alcoholic and i was super addicted to weed and partied a fair amount in my teen years and i was angry after he divorced my mom when i was our relationship entirely changed mostly because i saw how horrible verbally abusive and controlling he was to my mom and becuase i was a little shit i definetly put up challenges and argued and was angry for reasons that were not my own but the way his anger towards grew until i couldnt say a single thing without him assuming i meant it in a way to hurt and offend him i remember so many instances where an offhand comment from me turned into him yelling and waving his hands above his head with me just trying not to react and as i got older it just got worse to hitting the walls or the steering wheel driving eraticly out of anger full on screaming like an animal sometimes dropping to his knees and hitting his head not hard enough to cause injury i think and once throwing a chair across the room all over arguments i dont even remember the subject off and now he expects me to be a responsible grown up and respect him as if i dont start to sweat the moment anyone i love raises the voice or changed their tone my mother was horribly abused as a child and sees my step dads actions as bad and immoral and unfair but not abusive and continues to encourage me to see him and mend a relationship but i dont think i can do it anymore i went to see him fathers day becuase i was in town and it was the same shit acting like i have no right to my own opinion lying to get his way about small things i am tired of this but i also feel so much pity for this man with no one left other then my little sister his blood daughter and they get along wonderfully which is definitely another confusing point for me basically i want to know if you think i have a right to feel this way if this sounds like abuse because its not like i didnt get harsh and bitter towards the end but i was a teenager probably on some drugs most of the time and he was a grown man i am just so unsure how to go forward i have tried demanding apologies but all i get is the same scoff and eye rolling and im tired of it but i dont want to call him abusive over things that happened years ago,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

ive posted about this a lot across various different subreddits but i wanna go into more of the specifics in case anybody has any advice that could be helpful for me i wont go into my moms abusive specifically or at least ill try not too but living here is horrible she actively tries to sabotage friendships my relationship jobs ways for me to leave and more in probably not mentioning i feel like im on the verge of a panic attack whenever im in the same room as her my mom noticing my fear will cause me to be yelled at ive been looking desperately for any possible ways for me to escape this place or for any way for me to secure housing if i get kicked out and i really dont have many options i dont have the grades or money for college i dont have a drivers license i dont have a car all of my devices except for this backup phone were taken away i dont have any family or friends i can live with when i leave and we live in a very bad area in terms of rentjob opportunities cheap shitty apartments are around a thousand and i found one studio thats around bucks but its in a very car dependent area so that probably wont work im at a fucking loss i barely understand what taxes are and how to do them and im generally just not prepared for adult life but i cannot live her any longer i just fucking cant life is so scary and horrifying with my mom around and if she finds out about this phone im fucked after hours of using ai to calculate prices budgets and other things that i understand very little of as well as obsessively researching different towns and states to see where had decent rent prices i actually found something promising theres a town in my state thats not only very walkable but also has somewhat decent rent prices so honestly my current plan is to just try to find a way to get there and then find a cheap studio to live in problem is i dont have a car and i dont even have a months worth of rent saved and my mom probably wont allow me to get a job she fucking loathes me but is also terrified of me abandoning her not to stigmatize cluster b stuff as the spooky abuser disorder ooooooooh but im absolutely convinced she has borderline and narcissism im planning to ask any classmates i can if theyre looking for a temporary roommate when my senior year rolls around in a few months but ill probably be fresh out of luck im autistic and socializing is very hard for me as well as that due to somebody there sharing extremely personal information about me out of spite a lot of people know about my old self harm habits as well as other deeply uncomfortable things theyre kind of the ringleader of the lgbtgroup at my school and because of that im constantly misgendered and dead named even by other fellow trans people it feels so fucking awful and basically no groups at my school will accept me due to us living in a very right wing area ive considered just asking online on transautistic communities if anybody nearby is in need of a roommate but first of all safety lol and secondly i dont really know how most of these communities would probably remove my messages or outright ban me out of fear of me being a predator and i doubt somebody who would be looking for a roommate would settle for somebody who would have to be driven everywhere as well as someone who probably wouldnt be able to pay rent for at least a month so they can jobhunt every day that passes the risk of homelessness just gets scarier and scarier i try to sound cool and composed while typing out a lot of these messages but im really fucking scared if anybody has any advice or any other communities that i could probably reach out to please dont hesitate thanks for reading,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hello im currently and ive sort of come to the realization that my parents are not behaving like how my friends parents act towards them and with each so please tell me if theres something wrong with me or with my parents ok so ill start of by saying that my parents never and i mean never got along honestly my sister asked them to get divorced but they refused because of how society may view them if that happens so due to this whenever my parents even sit together they fight their so sick of each other that they dont even wanna look at each other faces me and my siblings tried our best to maybe mend their relationship or make them atleast friends or stand each other for our family sake but they hold grudges against each other and they dont wants to forgive each other my dad in the past would go out for weeks and not return home whenever he fought with mom all i remember is me calling him messaging him and even recording videos and sending it to him begging him to come back he always did because he loved us but he hated my mom he would trow food down on the floor and trow all of her stuff out of their room etc my mom would never react to that and simply go somewhere else which was good so their fights never got bad to the point of my dad physically hurting her my mom tried her best by always trying to make dad happy to the point where she stopped paying any attention to us she was also working but then something rightfully snapped in her and she stopped trying to please him and rightfully fight back i always felt like i was walking on thin ice whenever i talked about dad around her my dad moved to the upper side of the house but he was still living in the same house as mom at this point and even when i tried to talk to her about a different subject she would always round it back and say your dad did this or that she would basically trama dump on us kids i love my mom but honestly i was a kid i didnt want to see my dad in a bad light i know he didnt love mom but he loved us so for our sake he tried to be more nicer to mom and change his way like leaving for weeks etc honestly he still hasent changed much but hes trying but at this point in time it was to late and my mom didint forgive him so my dad gave up as well and now both of them live in the same house pretending as if eachother dont exist so this is the back story for my parents and the possible reason they might be abusive but their behavior towards us is what i want u guys to evaluate for example my mom hitting and shoving us and screaming at us if we get in a argument with her and my dad is always saying to our relatives how toxic our house is which annoys my mom even more and he knows it also he keeps saying we are ungrateful and we dont love him etc etc when hes the one paying the bills and he also used to trow stuff like food my mom made near us and would vanish for weeks my mom keeps bringing and blaming my dad for everything whenever we argue with her like your dad didnt raise you right thats why your this way etc,Positive

hi i am a year old male living in australia for the past years or so my father who i live with has been emotionally abusive it started in when he blamed my mother for screwing up in raising us and threatened to take us all away and make us live with him he was living in another state for work from that point on he became an incredibly volatile individual and at one point he threatened to throw a key at my mothers face because she told him that he was being reckless when pressuring us to cross the road in dangerous traffic he apologised the following day but he still continued to be threatening at times and one time physically threatened my sister because she was too obsessed with her phone just a week or so ago he unleashed a barrage of verbal abuse at my brother who struggles with depression saying that hes pretty much worthless has no job and saying that when he looks at his brother he is reminded of his failure as a father he also shamed my brother for quitting his medical course and flying back to australia which my brother did because he had ptsd from contracting covid and almost dying in poland ive battled with depression for numerous years and its now reached a point where i feel absolutely suicidal i want to get as far away as possible from my father but i live with him and have no means of financially supporting myself i also dont want to abandon the rest of my family including my brother at such a tough time i am also fearing retaliation from my father but i simply feel i can no longer do this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my parents are extremely dirty and filthy people and they are major hoarders ive spent all my life trying to clean up their messes they leave all their crap everything many rooms are filled to the brim with their crap ive fought with them so many times telling them to get rid of their shit or just put it away but they dont give a fuck ive even tried to speak to them calmly about how their mess affects me mentally but they still do not change there is no routine cleaning of any areas of the house to protect my mental sanity i just hole up in my room and rarely come downstairs or interact with them they only ever clear stuff up when guests come and they demand that i clean up with them it frustrates me so much because there have been many time where i will make the house look spotless but they will bring their shit and crap all over the house again and its a mess once more nothing can be maintained they are so so comfortable living in a filthy environment because of this i have stopped cleaning the house because if they cannot respect themselves and our family enough to keep it clean then why should i i dont have to share any spaces with them i am fine staying in my room we are middle class and my parents constantly bring home dozens of items from food pantries and we literally have no use or space for these items they will literally eat moldy food and just scoop out the moldy part and eat the rest of the moldy food they leave open food out everywhere we have had several cockroach and mice infestations and ive had to beg and scream for us to get pest control treatments they refuse to continue because they think its no major deal having vermin our drawers and cabinets in the kitchen and living room are constantly filled with mice poop once we had a whole bag of rice that was torn apart by mice and it was filled with mice poop my parents proceeded to handpick the mouse poop out wash the rice several times cook it and serve it to us i was in absolute shock last week i saw a mouse in our dish rack who knows where these mice get into they could be crawling over our clean dishes i resort to my bed room and buy and eat packaged food or take out i despise them and their filth and refuse to help them clean when guests come over and they will try to emotionally abuse me and even try to hit me if i dont help them my mom claims that even if there is crap everywhere that i should still vacuum dust and sweep i dont even spend any time downstairs so i dont even feel obligated to clean there if they do not respect their children to keep the house clean for them then why should i clean up for their guests plus it feels pointless to me because vacuuming the floor isnt suddenly going to make the room look spotless i can clean the fridge but i cant throw away any old food i can wipe down all surfaces but there are still doing to be random condiments bottles and crap all over the countertops so what is the point am i in the wrong is my response valid i have currently locked myself into my bedroom because my dad was being physically aggressive and violent who the fuck would want to clean your dirty fucking house when you try to intimidate them into doing it,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

just some that i remember they have done so many things to me and i am just so sick and tired of it when i was a kid my mom beat me for not drinking a glass of water and dumped it on my head i was when i was a kid i used her bangle to trace a circle and i took a nap so naturally i forgot where i put it she beat me and put all my toys in the trash thinking that i was lying and hiding it somewhere i was when i was a kid she would hit me a lot for simple things like not getting dressed fast when i was a kid she hit me and screamed at me for changing my barbie dolls outfit claiming that i am a pervert and i was creepy i was when i was a kid my mom asked me for the scissors she was laying on the sofa so i put it flat on her chest since she was laying down not pointing towards her or anything she turned to me started screaming hysterically and crying that i tried to kill her and beat me i was when i was a kid she would constantly say i have no respect for her because i didnt say mommy at the end of each sentence she would beat me and scream at me i was when my younger sister was born i took a lot of care of her and i was they just let me do everything for her i fell behind on my homework because of that and i got beat when i wanted to hang out with my friend who was a different religion from me they would scream at me and say horrible things about her and not let me see her eventually i was not able to see any of my friends and i could not even ask for permission to leave the house i became so lonely i was they would get mad when i wore pants in the house and strictly wanted me to wear underwear in the house when i did wear them i would get my butt slapped or squeezed by both parents this went on until i was years old all of a sudden they wanted me to cover up once i turned and even wearing skinny jeans was horrible when i wore skinny jeans around the ages since everyone in my school was wearing it and i didnt want to be made fun of my dad accused me of trying to show off my body to everyone and screamed that i am losing my self respect i was an underdeveloped child i got my period when i just turned i was not allowed to have sex ed my parents didnt consent so i did not know what a period was they said that what is happening to me is really bad and i cannot tell anyone and i am not allowed to touch animals or plants and i do they will die because of me they did not give me menstrual pads they gave me diapers the ones old people use and convinced me that i had some disease and i was going to die soon they had me do that for a year whenever i got my period in school i felt so uncomfortable putting on a diaper and so afraid someone may see it and make fun of me i did not know periods were a normal thing until i was i asked them about it and their reasoning was i was too young so they were ashamed and thought i could not handle how to use a pad properly i was not allowed to listen to music that was not religious until the age of when my dad saw me listening to music with headphones he screamed at me told me i was listening to vulgar lyrics and i am trying to be an adult so bad by getting into bad content by taylor swift is apparently vulgar when i was i dated my first boyfriend when we broke up i cried and my mom noticed when i lied about it she said she knew it was about a guy so i had to tell her i had a boyfriend she beat me screamed at me threw a bottle of mouthwash at me and threw my instrument i played for school a saxophone against the wall when i was in th grade i switched my career focus path out of computer science to undecided as after one semester i realized i did not enjoy it additionally my parents were the one who wanted me to do computer science i forgot to tell them i switched and my mom saw my courses online after i switched she asked me where computer science was and i told her i switched it and i forgot to tell her that day she went ballistic on me she called me a failure called my whole extended family saying i was going to work in mcdonalds for the rest of my life beat me horribly and then choked me i thought i was going to die that day so i pushed her and then she started crying and screaming to my dad that i hit her then my dad scolded me saying that a child cannot hit the parent but the parent can hit the child my mom said she will stop this argument if i choose to either become a doctor or engineer not knowing what to do i just picked doctor i kept that path in high school for them when i was turning i had wanted to wear a dress to school for my birthday she said my dress was too short even though it was above the knees and i said it wasnt and she said that i wont understand and i should get raped so i actually understand a few weeks after that i got sexually assaulted in a hoodie and sweatpants we went on vacation and randomly my father started ignoring me and being misognystic towards me and i started crying and told him to please not say that and women and men are equal he said that i am worth a and he doesnt care ever and over again as i was bawling in his face i was i told my father i felt sexually harassed by my school coach he said that he coach probably sees me as a grandchild and i need to stop assuming bad things about men the coach pressed his front to my back while i was trapped and could not away in the pandemic my grades dropped and i was very suicidal instead of supporting me they told my sister to not talk to me until my grades went up i was already incredibly lonely i had a mandatory therapist from my school as my school found out about how suicidal i was i had to do a mental health screening with my pediatrician and my result was really bad my mom talked about how i cut myself just because i got yelled at over simple things the doctor reprimanded at her that she needs to actually support me as a mother and i am clearly struggling she said i had to see a therapist sooner when we got in the car i asked her if i was getting a therapist she told me to shut up and there is nothing wrong with me and i lied to the pediatrician i was really suicidal when i was and instead of getting me help my dad dragged me on the floor with my hair beat me until i was a ball on the floor and video called relatives showing me crying that i wanted to die i started developing a bigger chest when i was i was only allowed to wear baggy clothes then and i had to dress masculine my dad would compliment me saying i actually looked respectable i enjoy dressing ultra feminine soft and coquette fashion i hated myself so much for the way i looked whenever i showed any bit of my figure or my chest looked big both my mother and father would slut shame me and say i was losing respect for myself i was and i never had any self esteem because i felt so ugly wearing masculine clothes and not being able to show even a little bit of my figure which i had grown to like i gained weight due to depression and my family both body shamed me instead of encouraging me to work out or be healthier when i started going to college i stopped answering their calls often i had to live with them during holidays though after my first year i realized i did not want to do stem and pursue the medical field i was screamed at horribly by my mother saying what will happen to our family reputation if i end up a failure doing a simple job after coming all the way to america i ended up choosing a field i genuinely liked after months of thinking but still makes good pay but not stemmed related i wish they told me theres other opportunities outside of those things to make a good living my sister was failing out of middle school and she did not get any consequences from it instead they just made me do her homework for her when i had my own college assignments to do recently i have told them that i have a boyfriend and i have been going out with him he makes me so happy and actually unconditionally loved i told my mom and at first she sounded accepting i felt hopeful that my relationship with her will actually be repaired as weeks progressed she started being really aggressive and started indirectly slut shaming me saying i have no dignity theres no need for me to see my boyfriend and i should focus on school my father is completely ignoring my existence for the last few weeks after months of therapy trying to forgive them for all the abuse they caused me in my childhood and teenage years now i am not being allowed to go out with anyone but im going to break that rule this is my last straw after realizing that i can actually be unconditionally loved appreciated and cared for i just want to leave i dont care if its a dumb idea i just want to go no contact with them immediately because i cannot stand being treated so sub humanely anymore i am tired of being controlled i called the suicide hotline times this week because it hurt so much and while i was talking to them something in me just snapped i am just done with this treatment i am so so done i want to leave i cannot live more years like this if theres any way i can get help financially to move out please let me know any tips for this is appreciated,Positive

i f havent been allowed to go to friends houses since elementary school when i went to a private school where my parents could actually know the other parents i had one girl over after she insisted when i was a middle schooler in public school and that went awry she behaved poorly and since then i havent been allowed to have anyone else over period for years i was told no bf till something i obeyed in freshman and sophmore years towards the end of junior year i got a bf that i hid until they eventually found out about i was when they found out previous to meeting this guy i had another very short term bf they also found about and i did dump at their command now keep in mind ive been a very good student for years mostly as only one c in all four years of high school macroeconomics i took ap courses and dc classes and passed them all so in all matters of college its always been made clear by my father that i was to be a lawyer and there was no other choices when i try to tell him about my passion for writing and computer science separately primarily interested in writing its shut down with talks of how im going to be a lawyer then a judge and do what he wants in our city my mother is more lax on that but still insisted i be a lawyer and when talking about it to others or them its easier to talk about what im going to college for a bachelors degree for so she took that as me not going to do it and ditching it for my bf who is two grades below me though hes they badger me about this any time the topic is brought up and it significantly raises my anxiety previous to having my bf i was in a deep depression and they somehow didnt notice he helped put me back together the only times we could hang out though was in a club after school so we did that and my father said i could walk to the local gas station with friends from the club so i went with them sometimes or i went with the bf and wed stay out a bit longer just hanging out on school property when my parents found out they pulled me from every one of my clubs and they had recently let me hang out with one friend out of school because they knew his parents well i was no longer allowed to hang out with him either because i might be around bf i am no longer allowed to do pretty much anything that means leaving the house i own a car but im not allowed to go for drives even though they said i would be able to i wasnt allowed to have a job while in high school so i have borderline nothing saved up for school they also are unwilling to pay for my college in any form aside from maybe meal plan saying that they did everything they were going to while i was in high school on top of the issues with college while i was with my bf my father kept threatening violence towards him so i told bf to stay away from my father also my father told me that if he ever was around the kid that he would hurt him badly when i was somewhat allowed to be with bf they constantly would tell me that i was a wet blanket now that theres nothing to me and talk about how i was giving up everything i wasnt in the slightest and insult me frequently they even got my youngest brother to start doing the same as well i cant talk with my bf through text because they might see it and get onto me i have to use apps that i have to delete frequently and my phone gets put up at night so i rely on my computer they said if i ever go to his house theyll call the police and say theres drugs in the house they also talk about how if i go over there ill be raped by the stepfather trafficked that the parents will hurt me in ways that will eventually kill me and that when it happens theyll be on anyones side but mine they detail the ways i would be harmed in the past theyve got me so stressed and anxious that i cant eat i cry myself to sleep then they threaten to take me to the mental hospital for not eating or acting upset in any way i said i might not come home some weekends of college and they took that badly and went back to talking about every possible bad thing that apparently will happen when i go to bfs house i have had to keep my best friend hidden for years now because they dont like his family so i have to talk to him the same way i do with my bf through other chat apps im barely able to tell them about my actual passions because they dont care though they say i never talk to them it got so bad when i was somewhat allowed to be with him that i started making plans to run away then i let it slip in one of our fights that i could just leave and stay with bf since then theyve been threatening violence towards him more than ever and they know the police and sheriff in my town and talk about how no one would ever believe ive been treated bad ever and that i havent ever been treated bad i really dont know what to do im running out of options and all the options i have are bad stay leave bf be miserable and lose the things that make me happy and the main person i can talk to stay stay with him continue life like this and watch everything get taken away leave stay with a friend so they cant find me lose them and my siblings in any situation im miserable but if i leave i just stay in the college dorms and stay with a friend on breaks i hate it here too often and stay in a mild panic thinking that if i can just make it through the day its another day closer to being freeish,Positive

id like to start off by saying im very nervous too call my parents abusers thats a very strong word very negative and it would mean i need a lot more help than i am willing to allow myself to believe as of right now i love my parents i believe they love me but when i was younger the way that i was treated is a haunting memory my mother was the main person that would hit me physically she would give me whoopings for somethings which is in someways normalized but she would also have bouts of angriness about things that i said or did that would make her go absolutely ballistic on me these were usually things that were small but her emotions would be at a boiling point and she would let them spill over physically punching and sometimes kicking me this was mainly when i was younger and had less ability to fight back i am now bigger than my mother so her trying to beat me up would result in her most likely also getting hurt my dad has always come to my rescue at these times afterward he ignores my mom for a week and she blames me and my disrespect which i have said some disrespectful things but nothing to warrant that reaction and then everything goes back to normal my dad also has bouts of angriness they are less common than my mothers and he usually does not hurt me as bad as he works to display that he is stronger than me there is also a lot of gaslighting and manipulation that goes along with this that i cannot get into because who has the time,Positive
im going off to job corps in a couple of weeks i told him i could take care of myself then he laughed and said well see i know he expects me to quit the program and come crawling back to him but what if i do what if i cant take care of myself after all im trying not to let him fuck with my confidence but i cant help but have that nagging feeling that maybe hes right,Neutral
as the title says ive made several other posts about specifically what im gonna do when i leave get kicked out and while i have a few plans for when it does eventually happen the fucking constant stream of negativity is just too much for me to handle a while ago my mom went out of state with my siblings to go visit some family i stayed behind with my stepdad to occasionally clean the house and go to my stepdads office to clean for some extra money and holy shit best days of my life the anxiety was still there but everything just felt so peaceful and mellow i genuinely felt happy if i wanted to get up and just make myself a grilled cheese or a quesadilla simply because i felt like it i could i was able to finish watching breaking bad a show my mom kind of blew up at me for watching because my bio dad was an addict at one point and for some reason she thought i was watching the show to learn how to make meth which uh just what the fuck and i was also just able to nap and relax whenever i felt like it i had chores to do but i could do them at my own pace and considering that im autistic and i have sensory issues just being able to get them done when i feel good about doing them just felt absolutely wonderful i didnt have to worry about getting them done literally as soon as i wake up and i didnt have to worry about her screaming at me and bursting through my door because i put a dish in the wrong cabinet or some shit i could just take my time and do things at my own pace i actually felt more motivated to do housework simply due to the fact that i could do it at my own pace without having to worry about my moms verbal abuse i honestly cant begin to describe how nice it felt those days genuinely some of the best days of my life because i could just take things at my own pace and like be me something im really not able to do around her and then she showed back up from the first fucking moment she arrived we were already having issues according to her i looked scared when i was helping bring in groceries and stuff expressing fear around her is a death sentence and later when she ended up yelling at me over essentially the same thing she made a sarcastic remark about how obviously i seem to be uncomfortable around her and how she doesnt have to live here about a year ago when she kind of forced me to admit i was suicidal she hit me in the face immediately and mocked me i let it slip that i was very uncomfortable around her which is absolutely true shes been using this piece of knowledge against me and she brings it up in order to make me feel ashamed and guilty shes yelled at me a handful of times over me looking afraid and uncomfortable around her shes been here like days and just i am so fucking constantly stressed my chest is tight my mind is racing my entire body just feels horrible because of the anxiety my sensory issues are getting worse and everything just feels so shitty honestly another thing i should mention im using a backup phone right now she doesnt know i own this my regular phone was taken from me because she looked through it and saw me researching cps and online abuse communities this backup phone is basically the only way for me to talk to my ldr partner my mom is convinced the theyre a pedophile trying to sell me into a human trafficking ring and she constantly misgenders and generally dehumanizes them her reasoning for all of this is because she found a message where they were discussing a vpn they used thats literally it and as well as that this phone is my only way to research what im gonna do when i either leave or get kicked out i have a little under dollars at the moment and i have a little less than a year until i turn i dont have a drivers license and my mom got mad at me because of it saying that i need to take initiative and ask her to take me driving so i can prepare to get my license heres the thing i really dont want to fucking talk to her at all whatsoever let alone drive around a parking lot for minutes with her breathing down my neck but at the same time theres really no other way for me to get my license and i dont think theres anyone else who can take me driving my current plan is to just save any money that i get and try to find either a roommate online or a really cheap bedroom apartment which is easier said than done we live in a very republican middle of nowhere area and there arent that many jobs around im afraid that if i get kicked out or leave or whatever and i find a temporary place to live my mom might find where i work absolutely fucking scares me ill also probably have to just walk back and forth to the store wherever i work and generally anywhere else i might need to go and it gets hot in this area i honestly feel like most places probably wont hire me if i dont have a car considering that id come to work sweating bullets every day other than that in order to actually get money ill probably just try to donate plasma as much as i realistically can because i just dont have many other options there is no way id be able to go to college any time soon basically chance my grades are absolutely terrible and i am not going to get myself involved with the predatory as fuck student loan system not a chance yknow how in tv shows theres always like a loser character who just lives in a tiny apartment and stays inside playing videogames or just hanging out with friends i would genuinely be so fucking happy with that life just having my own private space to live and just being able to spend time with whatever hobbies interest me and just generally not going out much that sounds like the fucking dream to me seriously i uh do not require a lot to be happy lol not much at all but even like small shitty apartments are expensive now and i was never really able to learn about things like taxes rent or any of that because nobody really ever taught me everything i know about paying taxes and filing for disability i learned from secretly researching overnight on this tiny backup phone that i keep under my pillow everything just feels so overwhelming im turning into a legal adult soon but im not really excited unless i know for certain that ill be able to secure housing soon as well as a job its kind of impossible for me to really be happy at the moment and even excluding all of that im still constantly fucking stressed and physicallymentally overstimulated because of my mother constantly making my life absolute hell things just feel so bleak and hopeless if she finds out about this phone its over and im fucked i wont be able to research housing options i wont be able to communicate with my partner at all and i wont have access to abuse communities just any advice whatsoever would be lovely i guess just about like finances tracking down a cheap apartment or roommate getting a job taxes coping with the fucking debilitating stress anything at all thanks for taking the time to read this,Positive
trigger warning child abuse this is going to be a long post that requires some background i recently told my younger sibling a secret that we have been keeping until he was old enough and he did not react the way i thought he would i really do not know what to do now and i need some advice validation i am sorry for the length and how messy it will be this whole situation has been rattling around in my brain and i think it will help to write it down please do not be afraid to ask for clarification names will be changed for privacy i also do not know what community to post this on open for suggestions i f have three siblings i dont talk to one but the others i try to keep in contact with i will refer to the eldest one as frank and the younger one as harry when we were growing up we lived in extreme poverty and the recession hit us pretty hard harry was too young to really remember to extremely difficult times but there were times i remember crying because i was so hungry the house we lived in was also disgusting and we were never really taught the importance of basic hygiene our mother was a piece of shit she would sit in her room smoking cigarettes and playing on her phone and ignoring us at all costs she would force our father to get her fast food while we were to scrounge whatever we could in the house this forced me and the other older siblings to take care of one another especially taking care of harry i could talk forever about how she did us the older siblings dirty my father on the other hand i want to say he did the best he could but i know better he has a short temper and was prone to exploding and punching holes in walls trigger warning he was also the one who sexually abused me and my older siblings until i was about i have conflicting feelings about my father because how could someone do that to their child a person they brought into this world to raise and protect on the other side he took care of us fed and clothed us after i turned i started isolating myself i kept to my room and focused on my school work made online friends a few years pass and i started hanging out with my siblings again and we became close once more i did my best to teach harry how to treat people with respect he grew up to be one of the best people i know which makes it hurt significantly more that he treated me in this manner at i moved out and i cut contact with my parents shortly after that i know this was extremely hard on harry because he was left alone with my parents despite our parents being horrible people they were better to harry than the rest of the siblings after things became better money wise they started to get involved in his life going to school functions buying him things etc i have this one specific example one time when the older two siblings left the house our parents wanted to go on trip i was about at the time and i worked a full time job and needed to give them a months notice if i wanted to go on vacation instead of informing me ahead of time they told me a week before rented a car and then left without me i was obviously very upset about this and my father promised me that we could plan a vacation for later that summer when they came back a week later i learned that harry had caused them to spend more than intended which meant that my vacation would suffer i ended up paying for basically everything but gas and it was only a two day trip in our tiny shitty car i am not bitter about the money hell once i got a job i spoiled that little boy too i am bitter about how our parents seem to care more about him though that is not the issue honestly just a little background to understand more of where harry is coming from when i cut contact with our parents harry was confused and hurt i also believe that our parents tried to get him to tell them why i choose to cut them off the thing is i did not tell harry what our father did i wanted to let him have his parents while he could frank and i discussed that we would tell him after he graduated but i ended up moving across the country when he was about i felt that this was a conversation that needed to happen inperson i came back to my home town for his graduation i wasnt going to tell him on the day of his graduation because that would be awful and that day was about him i was there for a whole week i informed him months prior that i would be there i know that week is pretty busy and hectic but i only saw him for about minutes after he walked the stage i was supposed to go to his graduation dinner but when i saw him on the field after getting his diploma my mother ran up to me and tried to give me a hug i stuck my arm out and told her fuck no she ended up running away crying and my father told me that they didnt appreciate the attitude honestly it was pretty cathartic telling her no and it was the highlight of that trip after that i made a plan with harry to see him at least once more during the week before i had to go back home we went on a minute walk and during this walk i asked him and frank to come visit me next summer they agreed and seemed excited about it and they had plenty of time to plan and save money flash forward to december of the same year i went back to see them during this trip i saw harry for hours at a local coffee shop and i stayed at franks apartment for the week i reminded them that i will see them in the summer and they looked apprehensive which confused me after going through the details they reiterated that they were infact coming to see me in the summer i chose not to tell harry about our father at this time because we were in public and this was also the first time i met his girlfriend so again not an appropriate time frank and i did discuss in length that we were going to tell him when they came up to see me in june february rolls along and i ask them how they were doing on saving for their trip to see me this is when harry decided to let us know that he was not coming he felt like it was unfair to him that we did not tell him what was going on with me and our parents frank did not cut contact with our parents btw and he told us that it was hurting our parents he also expressed grievances about how it felt like we didnt care about him when we were growing up and constantly teased him to clarify we would joke about his hair because it was a little frizzy and his acne but nothing excessive and we would have stopped if he had simply told us it bothered him harry also talked about how it hurt that we kept this big secret from him and that we didnt trust him to end it all he said he did not think it was worth it to come up and see me i was crushed my baby brother did not think i was worth it i left our group conversation and did not talk to him for months now comes to the heart of the problem in may i felt like it was time to tell my grandmother what a shit human her son was but frank and i decided that harry deserved to know first i got in contact with harry and scheduled a phone call between the all of us and this is where it gets super messy so bare with me please it was so awkward at first because i did not know where to start and frank wanted me to lead this conversation i asked harry if i should just say it or ease into it he told me to say it so i told him that our father would regularly abuse us for a span of about years he said okay this shocked me and made me angry ngl i was going to say more because i thought maybe he didnt understand the implications of what i said he interrupted me and yelled that he heard what i said the first time i was astounded i asked how he could be so casual about it and he said i thought it would be worse i dont know if i could ever forgive him for some of the things he said during this phone call i understand not wanting to know the details but he was cruel i asked him if he remembered our father throwing our brothers around and his anger he told me yes but i dont see how hard he is trying fuck that first off i asked how could this not change anything for him and he asked me if i wanted him to be angry i was shocked did i now that i look back of course i did this man our father was supposed to protect us and he caused us life lasting pain yes i wanted it to change things for him i wanted harry to at least grieve for our childhood i wanted him to understand us more instead he was apathetic towards it and angry at us he said that it didnt affect him then and it doesnt affect him now and that it hurt more that we didnt trust him i understand him feeling isolated because we choose for him decided that he wasnt mature enough on the other hand how could he forgive our father for years of pain and abuse and not forgive us for trying to spare him a little i had a panic attack in the middle of this phone call and left for about minutes during that time i tried calling my support system no one answered except my grandmother who was deeply concerned but also was in the middle of a grocery store i just told her that it did not go as planned and that she should call me when she gets home i had a full on melt down in my car after that after collecting myself i saw that the call was ongoing still i joined and things had calmed down honestly i dont remember this part as much but we apologized about letting our tempers get the better of us and i told them that i still wanted to see them this summer it wasnt until afterwards did i remember the horrible things that harry said and i dont think i can forgive much less forget it harry has not made any attempts to contact me since then and it has been a month or so i am so exhausted and i feel alone i thought i could depend on my brothers but it is becoming more and more apparent that they do not feel the same about me please tell me your thoughts,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hey guys i just need some advice on my current situation i f am the eldest sibling of my younger siblings are f and m i have a stressful job though it pays me well and im working from home we currently live with my parents dad m has always been abusive since i could remember he used to be physically abusive but as old age kicks in he became less physically abusive but got more violent with verbal assaults and verbal abuse mom f has always tried to be understanding tried to make peace between us but dad only got worse and all three of us could not stand him he would blame mom when things dont go his way called us kids names in front of his friends and make up stories such as calling us useless who only knows how to ask him for money which never happened he would also tell his friends how rude we are to him and disrespects him as a father when all we do is tell him how rude he is when he calls us names like slts bastrds and curse us to get married to rapsts when he doesnt get his way so whenever he did that we only tell him that he is the one being rude and he describes that as being disrespectful but doesnt elaborate so all his friends believes him dad also makes a mess of the house and expects mom to clean up after him she works practically days a week i occasionally help with the dishes and housekeeping but there are days when im so exhausted from work i just collapse and fall asleep i dont know how my mom managed to do this for years as mom works too because dad refuses to cover the house expenses my sister f is moving out with her boyfriend soon ive also considered moving out but recently i got scammed and lost most of my savings so i had hoped to stay at home another years until i could build my savings back up however my main concern is that im unwilling to leave my mother and brother behind with my abusive father my mother is unwilling to move out because she believes that she could get into legal trouble for abandoning my dad but i truly believe this is beyond her responsibility and she doesnt deserve the treatment my dad regularly gives her we most certainly can sustain ourselves if we moved out but my mom refuses to she is already and assuming that she lives up to i dont want her to spend her last years enslaving herself to my dad work stress along with family stress the fact that i got scammed because ive been careless losing of my life savings and having to cope with losing my pet recently who had been my only emotional support is slowly taking a toll on my mind i considered therapy but decided i prefer to save the money besides i cant think of anything a therapist can tell me that i dont already know im perfectly capable of rational thoughts at the moment but living has been very difficult my friends all have rather alright families so i thought i rather not burden them with my family problems since its pretty heavy and they might not understand the level of abuse my dad is inflicting on us any advice or personal stories that could provide insights would help i just need another perspective as i dont know anyone who went through the same level of abuse my family has im just trying to make peace with myself and figuring out how to live with my current situation probably until my dad dies of either old age or taken by illness,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my therapist messaged me this morning asking if we can call later today little background i started therapy without my parents being aware because of obvious reasons since im posting this here she told me that she wont tell anyone anything unless she legally has to aka concern for my safety she also told me she would talk to me before she does id like to say ive had social services in my life vaguely twice and they just walked out again i think i said something in thursday in my last session that could have caused concern for my safety and i cant see why shed want to talk to me today and couldnt wait until our next session unless its so she can call social services or the police or something im terrified social services makes my life x harder i dont want to go through this again tbf ive already got it all planned so if she is going to call social services i can leave the second the phone call ends my friend said i can run away to her house if social services are called because they honestly put me in more danger in many ways i am btw but just because i have that plan doesnt mean i wont be found and im honestly so terrified about that too also there are cameras around my friends house so i need to be really careful not to be spotted by them if i do run away im terrified i have been shaking all day ive been trying to do studies and literally couldnt because i was too scared i havent eaten anything today either which honestly isnt that uncommon for me but still i wanna cry,Neutral
my dad is very abusive and controlling if anything that doesnt go like intended then he will start smashing and breaking things in our house like a child he even forced me and my littler sis to follow his bullshit rules such as we have to smile whenever were around him if not he will ground us or even worse he will beat us he always threatens us with violence if we dont obey him violence for him is always the best solution he always complains why didnt our house happy like the other families and will blame us for making this house not happy when hes the problem if your kids are always sad when they see you why dont you ask them why or maybe put effort into understanding them right he didnt do all of that because he himself is a selfish ass who always cares about himself he forced us to be happy whenever hes around like ive mentioned how can i be happy if im being forced every day in this fucking house is like a constant mental torture for me is there anything that i can do to keep myself safe from him thank you,Positive
honestly no idea where to start maybe last year anyways what happened is my father forced me out of my apartment i lived in for year after he and my younger sister moved in during covid because he lost his job i know huge mistake but my sis was and didnt want anything happening to her so he stole my debit card and was tapping at the atm and pulling out cash from my savings he stole k then when i went to check my savings i saw then and noticed that card was missing so i asked about it he started to throw my furniture at me and screaming eventually pulling his sks out loaded pointed at me saying i had min to leave so i ran out to my car where he followed me said to leave it as its his and some bs conspiracy theories about me try to kill him so on cops of course arrived then talked to him and me then told him to go back inside said they would let me grab what i could i said no its my apartment lease is in my name i rent the unit for about years they said according to him its his and im a drug addicted because that they refused to let me take my car and made dropped me off a rehabilitation clinic where i was found negative for everything but by that time my father stole the registration out of glove box and my insurance paper and they said with out those they cant prove the car was mine and refused to help me take it and dropped me off at the station where i spent a week at my friends on her floor as she was new to the country didnt have any furniture other then facebook market place free stuff her bf was small dick prik who didnt live with her and throw me out i ended up having to leave my job and hitchhiking across the country to my grandmothers where she was say i shouldnt talk about him badly to the people next door and how it was my fault for paying for the rent my self and groceries for people despite her sending him k a month that non of us there other then him knew about police still refuse to help me hes now forged my signature and registered the car under my sisters name because hes not registered in the province i used to live but is still in the current one im living for over years now despite live there km away ie insurance fraud so tried to report him for that but nothing anyways months later im getting a call from him claiming i stole my money back and hes going to call police on me if i dont return it because hes lots everything he stole i told him to go suck him self off days later police raided my place because i was doing side tech repair out of the basement and he claimed i was selling meth they found nothing apologized and still refused to help but now that claim even tho its marked false made my employer fire me as they have strict rules against anything showing up with you name in criminal history so now im still jobless missing a car and money furniture clothes hobbies total nearing k that hes been selling and wrecking who know who and out of fucking work fuck them and my grandmother still doesnt understand the issues trys to encourage me to apologize to him and nicely ask for everything back despite me paying her rent and building a kitchen and room in her basement fuck family fuck life fuck police fuck canada,Positive
hello all im thsense im f to be in a short while and ive been dealing with my mother for all my life go figure a little background im extremely fortunate for starters my family is fairly wealthy and ive lived a comfortable life since i was about i have always had my needs met and my life is pretty damn good im extremely lucky yes although i will say that in some ways the amount of cushioning ive had has left me with poor self support skills i am unable to handle failure well i am financially ignorant as i am unsure how to do many basic things understand taxes paying rent budgeting labor etc this is due to my parents trying to both shelter me and keep me from being dependent on them but thats another story entirely in any case my family is alright for the most part all families are in some form of dysfunction and thats pretty normal my mother on the other hand wields the narcissist trifecta of gaslighting hypocrisy and verbal abuse i on a daily basis have to put up with being called slurs made to do things because she is incapable of caring enough to do it herself and picking up her slack she is also extremely hypocritical and expects so much from me without delivering anything in return my dad is a hard worker and is stressed non stop because of his job and taking care of us i am also constantly having to deal with the destruction of my character and self esteem i can provide answers and examples as needed but i dont want to vilify my mother i love her very much but as adulthood approaches im becoming worried that if i dont get into college all financial support will be pulled from me because of her and me clashing constantly i want to know am i going crazy or is my mom truly a narcissist targeting me,Positive
so for a bit of context i m was a product of teen pregnancy my parents split custody of me before i could even remember the situation with my mom and stepdad was always horrific but thats a can of worms for another day on the other hand my dad while not flawless served as a solid foundation for my upbringing in hindsight thats all i could have hoped for however when i was around my dad succumbed to severe drug addictions transforming into a different person monstrous in behavior now that im an adult i seldom interact with him given his frequent incarcerations yet when we do speak its like conversing with a stranger hes changed beyond recognition from my childhood memories before he was addicted my father truly was an amazing single parent looking back i know he made so many sacrifices for me i have so many cherished memories with him despite this he now seems to have forgotten most of those moments its like my father had died and came back as this despicable persona wearing his skin i cant even love the father he once was when i remember the years of abuse and terror he put me through for years my grandparents and some other family members still naively hold a hopeful outlook for their son they even coerce me with best intentions into interacting with him but ive witnessed the cycle enough times to realize he wont change permanently despite temporary periods of sobriety or freedom from prison hell have my family fooled once more and ill have to force myself at a safe distance as i hear about how my dad is yet again back to his old habits whilst also leeching off of my poor beloved gullible grandparents to be truthful i dont think i will ever be ever to see him in a positive light again even if he were to clean up his act permanently nothing not even time is going to restore his drug corroded brain beyond the intellect and personality of a dangerous child nothing can make me forget the feeling of dread after getting home from school nothing can make me forget the pure psycotic episodes nothing can make me forget the fact you ruined my permanently and fundamentally tore my grandparents apart nor the fact you were also abusive to my grandfather nothing can make me forget waking up to being dragged by my hair out of my grubby floor spot at am nothing can erase the permanent physical and mental damage from being choked and punched nothing can ease the constant paronia and dread from being stalked after finally having enough legal evidence to emancipate i miss my father greatly but that man is gone forever yet i cant even mourn him when i was youngerish just a few years back i was filled with so much anger it was noticable and poisonous i hateful towards him and vindactive to loved ones who tried to help me move on i would fantasize about revenge now that i was older and stronger then he got nearly beat to death in prison seeing him in that bedridden state broke me his face and limbs were haunting a jumbled mess of blood filled eyes black splotches bandaged wounds disjointed features and grotuesqly swollen features from literally being kicked into the ground i could never do that to him or anything remotely close i felt so incredibly guilty this is what i had wanted for so long but it wasnt i didnt know what i wanted i still dont he was so frail then and still is now i dont doubt his life has been harsh in the recent years this was the man who did so much to support me through two bouts of cancer i probably wouldnt have survived without him this was the man who constantly stuck his neck out to act as my shield against my mothers abuse and neglect this was the man who would make me blueberry pancakes before school just to silently say i love you yet this isnt he is not that man anymore if he wasnt changed by his years of substance abuse he was definitely changed by his head trauma i had realized this during our most recent actual conversation some years ago it struck me that this man was seriously disabled now as well as cognitively impaired this may be the consequenses of his actions but it is both disturbing and heartrending to see the father i once admired go through such daily misery and bodily suffering i cant hold any resentment for this man anymore hating him would be like hating a child substance abuse and head trauma has irreversibly altered him leaving me with a lingering sense of melancholy and pity rather than resentment in conclusion i often find myself wishing he had passed away peacefully long ago sparing us both from this ongoing pain its a sentiment that fills me with selfhatred tldr my dads struggles with addiction have left him less than a shadow of his former self and its a source of profound sadness for me,Positive
a recent development through therapy that ive found about myself is that im absolutely terrified of being in a relationship platonic or romantic im terrified growing up was chaotic i lived a balance of abuse and neglect when my parents were home i was a frequent target for my moms emotional verbal and occasionally physical abuse my dad is a door mat who never stood up for us myself and older sisters who got out of dodge years before i could but then they would leave for days starting when i was young i had to become independent young i dont wanna trauma dump but i want to share enough to make this post make sense through this time i also witnessed my sisters be abused like i was they had much different responses to the abuse then me where my oldest dove headfirst into a small group of friendships my older sister was everyones friend and never was in the house i saw her and my oldest sister get punished for creating these relationships and frequently my parents would shame them to me about their relationships i coped through being the under the radar daughter the doing sufficiently to pass but not gain too much attention for grades or other achievements daughter i kept to myself and didnt build relationships romantic or platonic because i was trying to be invisible ive been out on my own now for the last years ive grown so much and feel like i can at least hold a conversation and start a relationship but i have no idea how to build a healthy relationship i know how to love others i jokingly call myself a universal donor of love i can give every type of love away i just dont know how to receive love or even how to create a loving relationship that actually will last people terrify me but i dont want to be alone forever anywho if anyone is actually still reading this id appreciate if you could share advice stories or tips,Neutral
throw back to my husband at the time m and i f had just gotten engaged graduated college and began searching for houses at the time we were living with my parents a little back story back in college we had just bought a dog and were living in an apartment when we found it had mold i was sick from it my parents told me that my dog would die from it if we didnt leave and insisted we move in with them and commute minutes to college to which i agreed i am their only child btw i had a rough upbringing i thought i was just rebellious but am realizing now they are control freaks my dad told me when i was that he put a gun to his head outside and almost pulled the trigger and it would have been my fault my mom called me fat multiple times forced me into pageants i didnt want to do she saw my bf kissing me once and wouldnt talk to me for months couldnt even be in the same room as me or look at me without crying oh and she kept saying its just my first wedding every chance she got they both told me that being a labor and delivery rn is gay and that i would be a terrible nurse but i have proved them wrong there is much more in between all of this but heres some my husband and i were searching for houses we were going to buy one when we told my parents wed be moving out they begged us to stay said we could transform the garage into a living space and they would move out there they said they would sign the house over to us my husband was fond of the idea since he didnt want to live in a neighborhood and my parents have acres i was not fond of it but knew we would save money in the long run so we got a contractor and cashed out my husbands inheritance from his deceased father he died when my husband was i used all of my savings to help pay it amounted to about k after everything as soon as we paid my parents demeanor changed they became rude and insensitive saying all sorts of horrendous things they began heavy drinking mid because my grandma died and their life was over the drinking got worse my dad called me a bitch for not wanting to pay k for painters i told them we would paint it ourselves it wasnt good enough for them they have caused fights about us throwing out a paint can screaming one hundred dollars isnt a lot to you but it is to us and proceeded to say they dont know how its going to work here and that they might just take us off everything flash forward to many stupid fights later we are here and they havent signed the house over they claim they are trying to merge the property from my grandma to their house then they will sign it over we put an additional k into much needed upkeep that they fell short on for years im currently pregnant with our first two children we have had many fights over the dumbest shit i could go into so many details but we would run out of space they have made claims that were taking advantage of them how theyve sacrificed so much and we havent done anything for them they blew their top over a paint can saying dollars isnt much to you but it is to us they have threatened to not add us on the house and have said multiple times this isnt going to work even better my dad and mom refused to stop smoking and drinking around my babies because it doesnt affect them i used to visit every day before i got pregnant and was super sick but now i visit once a week but that seems to not be good enough it was my baby shower today keep in mind my mom didnt throw me a bridal shower and claimed she was too busy with the renovation even though my husband and i were handling everything she didnt offer to throw me a baby shower either my husbands grandma and my friend did last night i texted my mom saying that we would be leaving at i figured we would be riding together since we live together and she is going to be a grandma well my mom ignored me and had my father text me he told me that she wont be riding with me and she will be riding with a cousin i told him i think that looks poor given she is the grandma and shouldnt be arriving with other guests he texted me saying my husband told him that we cant give my mom a ride i know this is not true what happened was that my husband took the dogs out and at the time had a lot on his mind from work my dad said my mom will need a ride to the shower my mom insisted she didnt and would drive herself their car is old and breaking which they have also insinuated that we should be buying them a car my husband said that either way works and just let us know continuing my father told me that he doesnt want to leave anything to us because of this and i left it at that in the morning my mom texted saying she wants to ride with us which we agreed she never apologized for the behavior or anything just pretended like nothing was wrong my shower was less than ok my entire family breezed past me barely asked about my pregnancy or the babies and talked to my mom i sat in the corner with my friend and husbands grandma while my mom entertained all of them she excluded my husbands grandma from the main dining table and spent an hour talking about how hard her life is with my dad and his health problems nobody knows what i go through she says the shower basically felt like a show for her my cousin said i heard you and my dad built a tiny house that must have been expensive my mom says yeah we did i walked over and said that my husband and i paid for it it was asked why my husband and i arent living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one i told them it wasnt our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house my mom didnt sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after after the shower everyone left and i said to my mom that i wasnt aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything she screamed to of her lungs you cant keep doing this to me my husbands grandpa definitely heard so do you think shes in the right and has scarified more than i have i am getting tired of the threats and becoming more concerned that they will try to evict us even though we pay the gas electric wifi and television bills with these babies coming soon i dont know what to do it would bankrupt us leaving without our money back and buying a new house am i ungrateful and in the wrong,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom pulled my hair really harsh intentionally today before i go out to eat at a restaurant with dad she said that my acne looks really bad and my hair is messy and she got mad at me for that so she started combing my hair it hurts for a little so i grabbed my scalp to prevent it from hurting and she got annoyed from that because it was in her way and so she said something like is your scalp that valuable in a sarcastic manner and she just pulled my hair really harsh and yelled at me when i yelp as if she expected me to be quiet after pulling my hair really harsh this is something she would always do she would point out my every little flaw on my appearance when its so obvious as if i dont know i would often get scolded or i think is what i want to call bullying by my own family members they will continue on and on mocking me and i would act as if it was nothing and take it as a joke but i think its also my own fault for having really bad acne my mom bought me some products for my skin care and i swear i use it i thought that my skin has gotten better than before but my mom still kept calling it disgusting and ugly she likes to comment on my body pointing out how fat i look im tall and is kg i take her insulti guess as a thought of her caring about me despite the harsh things that she does on my body im not sure about how i should feel about my mom she can be so sweet sometimes yet get mad at me for everything and im trying my best to be a good daughter and i dont really have anyone else to turn to or talk about my mom toa little bit of personal information of the reasons why im very worried to talk to my dad about my mom because hes one of the person that i really hate the most in my life and hes divorced with my mom and so im afraid that if i talk about my mom with him he would get her into some kind of trouble and i also dont want to talk to my brother about how i feel too because i think he definitely doesnt understand how i feel and what i think and weve never talk about something like this to each other anyway and with my other family members like grandparents and uncle trust me ive tried telling them many times but they ended up telling my mom about what i say to them or ended up being on my mom side and also telling me to listen to her,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

okay so this may seem weird but its like a genuine thing ive been struggling with warning i dont have a lot of memories so if she has like done anything severely bad so me i will not remember but uh basically im a teen lived with her all of my life my dad is out of the picture and for an extremely good reason i know shes extremely emotionally abusive always yelling blaming stuff on us getting mad at me oldest in the house in particular she also let me start smoking at uh she threatens physical abuse shes let my uncle whos long moved out burn my brothers hands with lighters and hit them as well as shes hit mea couple times but not badly just like a cuff around the head nd shit as well as she doesnt really get painkillers anymore ngl could be my fault but i deal with extreme migraines got them from her as well as undiagnosed knee issues also from her and she never gets painkillers no matter how much i beg her to she also lets me and my brothers get into physical fights and by that i mean they have kicked my knee out as well as nearly fractured my arm both of them are younger then me and both have severe mental health issues which they are on pills for but my mother simply reminds them and then moves on with her day and gets mad when they dont take them she doesnt stop the fights and i do not initiate the fights because well im almost my brothers are four years younger thats all i can remember but like yeah i just wanna know because my friend says she does but i honestly dont think so but could that just be me in denial,Neutral
i y have been abused by my parents and grandparents for as long as i can remember my first memory is my grandad approaching me as i was sat down on a potty one of those weird plastic toilets toddlers have and picking my up by my shoulders he screams something at me before he puts me down and slaps me across the face i was about years old i feel the best way to talk about this lifetime of abuse is to tell it in chronological order from the best of my ability my memory surrounding certrain things is hazy as for a while i tried to forget as much of this as i could firstly i think its important to give some information about my mum and dad my dad was when i was born and i believe my mum was he lied to her about his age my dad is addicted to weed and i know for a time he was addicted to coke too i remember he would often get arrested a lot he would also say he was leaving us but return hours later very clearly off his face on coke and whatever else my mum is a very manipulative and emotionally abusive woman when i was i witnessed her kiss another man in front of me we later on found out that they had been seeing each other for ages behind my dads back i havent been able to forgive her for that its also important to note i have many siblings i wont say how many as i have already given a lot of telling information and do not want my family to know ive typed and posted this many of my family members use reddit from the age of i remember getting beatings almost daily from my mum or dad these would be for the most minor of things such as forgetting to flush the toilet or turning the tv up a little bit too loud these werent little taps either i got fully manhandled and punched often i remember my dad pinning my down so my back is facing upwards he would hold my hands around my back while my mum would hit me on my ass until it was red raw no one can justify that sometimes it wasnt always my parents though sometimes they would call my grandad for such a long time the word grandad evoked so much fear in me when i was told he was coming over i would run to my room but on as many layers of clothes as i could and hid under my blanket when he arrived he would berate me about how much of a disgusting little cunt i was before he would punch me in my face and all over my body often i would have bruises as a kid i dont know how teachers at school didnt pick up on it i remember one christmas eve my xbox account wasnt working cant remember why and this understandably upset me i was after all my dad called my grandad over and i did the same routine clothes on over the covers and pray he doesnt hit me too hard this time this time was different though he came into my room and pulled me out of my bed by my arm and threw me down the stairs i ran into the living room where my nana was she slapped me in my face so hard i fell to the ground i tried to run out of the room only for my grandad to push me back into it i was made to sit on the couch while i got called the most horrific names i was so scared i wet myself and couldnt stop shaking i was years old not long after christmas it was my birthday i got disney infinity and a bunch of the little figures to go with it for months this was my hyper fixation i would play it daily and completed everyone one of the story set things i had one day my grandad came over and he started his usual borage of insults he turns to my organized disney infinity figures resting upon my xbox jesus im old and kicks them all over just avoiding the xbox he then turns around and leaves he broke so many of the figures i cried for hours and hours in my room alone no one came to check on me the figures being broken hurt so much more than the beatings i was now used to from this point onwards things are a little fuzzy i move house a few times and am now in secondary school im years old and questioning my sexuality heavily i get into fights both inside and outside of school and have started smoking cigarettes the physically abuse had stopped but the emotional abuse had got worse at the time i was a very fat kid i would eat to feel better my dad would often call me fat and insult me for everything i did every song i played booked i read and film i watched he would rip into me daily for no reason at all he would often say if i wasnt his kid and he saw me when he was a kid hed beat the fuck out of me when i was life started to get a bit better i found a group of friends that liked me i was no longer questioning my sexuality and was fully comfortable saying i was pansexual i also started to smoke weed with my best friend which has given us some of the best memories in the summer of that year we got evicted from our home and had to move into an emergency house this was hell and one of the worst times of my life i slept on the couch and my pc was in the kitchen where often my little siblings would throw food on it and try to tip if over my parents did nothing to stop this the insults still followed and i was made to feel so insignificant and small the most i slept in the months we lived there was hours a night one time my dad was berating me and he got in my face because i said something back to him he pinned me against the wall by my t shirt for the first time i felt all of the rage i had kept bottled up since i was a kid overflow and i punched him square in the face he fell back and looked at me in shock my mum rushed to his defense and screamed at me to leave i left for a few hours until my dad called me and told me to come home we havent spoken of it since now i am i am in the last few days of college then im off to university the emotional abuse still continues and there are so many things that im leaving out for the sake of length i could genuinely write a novella about all of this shit i am not sure what to do moving forward i really want to block them out and live my life peacefully and free however whenever i think about doing this i feel really guilty luckily i have an amazing and supportive partner who is helping me make sense of all of this the scars still feel fresh for anyone who is in a similar situation but has years to wait before they can leave keep your head up right now i know it is hell and it seems like there is no end my best advice is find something you love and cling onto it passion is found in the darkest of place in my case it was films you are not crazy or being sensitive it is abuse any question feel free to ask thank you for listening edit sorry if some of this makes no sense im dyslexic

my autobiography from my earliest memories my father has been a harsh figure in my life i recall years of abuse mockery and physical punishment including beatings with a belt one vivid memory is when my cousin bit me and my father praised him celebrating his actions another painful moment was when he tried to abandon me during a time i was possessed he criticized every action of mine and my childhood is filled with memories of constant family fights when i was just or years old he would distinctly say that he wouldnt include me in his will i had no understanding of money at that age but the fear was real his angry glares terrified me and i lived in constant fear of doing something wrong that would lead to further abuse he would kick me out of the house and demand the clothes off my back because he had paid for them at i was sent to a hostel despite my desperate pleas to stay my mother cried her eyes out but my father showed no emotion his frustration with me was so intense that even when i made a harmless joke he would get angry only to repeat the same joke himself moments later my sister pointed out the hypocrisy but it didnt change anything as i grew up my hatred for him deepened he frequently kicked me out of his business and his house if not for my mother i dont know where id be i eventually found a job and was given a month to leave his house i started my own business and helped him set up a new shop my marketing efforts paid off but i never received any appreciation instead i was always compared to others despite swallowing my hatred as advised his constant taunts cut deep i was treated like a plague in my family avoided like a germ when you are unloved in childhood you search for love to fill that void i did the same after seven years in a hostel i finally found someone who liked me at however the relationship didnt last i left a prestigious university because of my depression which led to more taunts and ridicule from my father i always wanted to learn to drive and begged him for a drivers license his response was dismissive suggesting i should become a driver to earn some money i tried to build a bond with him and things seemed to get a little better i contributed financially to his business without making any losses but any minor issue would result in a torrent of abuse despite bringing in thousands of rupees each month i received a fixed pocket money of just k rupees eventually i stopped taking any money from him during a period of depression i found love again for three years i was happy but then she cheated on me and i lost everything now i am heartbroken holding onto the hope of a miracle please dad stop abusing me if you want i will disappear i cant take this anymore stop,Positive

ive lost so many nights of sleep over this trying to make sense of something so heartbreaking and evil i try to see things from both sides a mother and a son its all so complex and complicated you see people will tell on themselves people will tell the truth even when they think they are lying if you pay close attention to every word spokenthe truth will always be right there from the very beginning there were red flags things that were said that just didnt seem rightand it got worse and worse the little things said became crys for help god blessed me with a gift sometimes it can feel more like a curse i can feel others feeling i can see things before they happen i get warnings and messages most times they are correct and small about of times i get information tangled i could feel his fear i could feel his confusion i could feel his dedication to someone who should have been sacred to him but betrayed him with the worst kind of betrayal i could feel your fear i could feel this absolute control you have sunk your teeth into for future reference im going to list how it all came together its started with him telling me how hot he thought his mother was then when i knew he was avoiding you for no reason and not telling you he was dating then he told me about a conversation the two of you had how you confronted him about seeing someone and his response was you are seeing someone too that is not a normal exchange of words between a mother and son once you knew your behavior said a lot the constant calling the phone conversations that lasted hours the constant texts hablame yes mothers worry and call but not like that then finding out you never did his paperwork for citizenship but you did your other two sons that right there showed your fear and tight grip you have held onto him showed how an abuser controls there victim then the text messagesthe inappropriate things said then seeing family photos a picture can say a thousand words that saying rang true the body language was off the pictures didnt look like a mother and her sons it looked like a mother father and son then watching the interactions between you and him and the way you looked at me then watching him interact with his baby brother he didnt know how to be a father and a brother and it all felt so awkward he remembers every detail of when his baby brother was born yea people remember stuff about siblings but the in depth details he speaks of are of a parent then the timeline of it all you leaving his father with him and his brother and coming to and during high school right when you got pregnant with his baby brother you sent him away to live with his father in another state it was your shame and fear of people finding out and if he was not around you could pretend it never happened and date a man who thinks he had a child with you when moving back things were only normal for him for a short period before you started your abuse again to be continued,Positive

behaviors of my dad that confuse me between abuse or normality calling out their abuse ill show you what real abuse is calling them a bully ill show you what a real bully is crying ill give you a reason to cry making fun of less fortunate friends friends who live in trailer parks little money divorced parents etc yelling screaming throwing things on a near constant basis hitting not all the time and it is a joke or playful not being able to figure something out then livestreaming me crying as i attempted to figure it out slapping me on the butt playfully or to show affection even after i asked him to stop purposely aggravates me and gets mad when i have a reaction making do work on a farm for hours on endcoming up with new or unnecessary chores so i cant take napsplay games or use my free time essentially taking all my free time has woken me up on multiple occasions screaming and yelling after this happened twice i now wake up at footsteps doors opening and closing or hearing someone yell while im asleep because i am afraid its him coming to wake me up physically ripped my door off its hinges for sleeping with the door locked he broke the lock and ripped the hinged off in the process threatened to take my door for not cleaning my room it isnt very messy but i have very severe episodes where i cant get out of bed for days unless he physically rips me out of bed took my hand that was holding a loaded gun i didnt want to shoot and was crying and he unloaded the entire may directly on the ground infront of my feet and yelled at me constantly compares me to other people makes fun of my body and then denies ever doing so when i tell him off for being rude he either yells at me or laughs and says are you on your period or something along the lines wont get me diagnosed for add not self diagnosing but im sure there is something wrong with me but he always gets mad at me for having symptoms yells at me for talking to muchasking questions and now im deathly afraid of asking questions to people especially in cars because he yells at me in the car the most and almost crashed because he was occupied while yelling just a few things that my dad does that confuse me a bit i might do another post with more things but i didnt wanna make it too long,Neutral
ive f been no contact with my father m for years now but found out two days ago that he has been sexually abusing his girlfriends kids the girl that my dad has been sexually abusing has apparently been in and out of rehab and mental institutions and just barely turned he has been in this girls life since she was years old her sisters described an incident in which they walked in on my father with his pants down and his hands in her underwear as she was sleeping my father had raped my mother repeatedly in her sleep towards the end of their marriage so this was not entirely news to me i never thought my dad was capable of sexually abusing a minor like that and it has made me question my childhood when i first started to try and have sex i realized that i have a sexual disorder called vaginismus which could stem from sexual abuse i have no recollection of being sexually abused as a child but with all that has transpired im starting to think my dad may have hurt me as well my heart hurts for the girls that he has sexually abused and i hope they are able to press charges im not sure how to come to terms with the guilt i feel as if there was anything i could have done to stop him from hurting others if you have had something similar happen how did you come to terms with it,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

this will be a long read im sorry and formatting might be terrible sorry im trying not to break down crying what i write this my mom was also abused as a child ill make the short but she got pregnant young and her mother got pregnant very young fat my mother was raised to buy other people except for grandmother she also wants thought physical abuse and parentification as far as i can think back before i was my mother would use corporal punishment the problem was not the hit when i did wrong be how far she would go it would leave mark and sometimes i would bleed i dont know thats a i really remember whats that she thought i a child under the age of smaller then her in both high and weigh she is obese i was a little overweight try to push her i didnt do such a thing and she pushed me so hard that i hit my head well she was still hiting me with her favorite belt it was leather and had a key at the end of it that how to fake diamonds in it which was most likely made of glass when i was i was walking behind her try to get my phone back through communication she turn around tackled me down and when i tryed to push her off she bit my index finger the day after my principal found out as i had an emotional breakdown she was close to call him the cps of my country i dont remember what i said but i somehow confinster that it was a fine her favorite punishing was kicking me out of the house i was not even a pretty when shes not in kicking me out for things such as leaving something on the floor you keep me out for hours or even a day and i would have to cry to some random neighbor to please let me stay under the roof she also did this recently about a year ago and this time i was actually willing to leave the house i was close to running away until she decided to play the victim im giving the head of myself sorry she will often searching me or shame me for overeating any times i could just stop eating purposely try to get anorexia because i thought mom would like me better and she would constantly act like this to other people as well she would make fun of people that are really skinny or just smaller then her either by saying that the person looks like they do cheated wall and then practically force feeding them whenever they come to our house stating that someone is a pig and because i lived with her the longest and i stayed without the longest i got most of these ones when i was a kid there was a specific neighborhood i would have to go there was a lot of weird people for example after age i started puberty very early i had d cup at the age of a man straight up ask me how much it would be to buy me for marriage to be more specific its a cultural thing where the husband gets the brides family a specific amount of money to be able to marry the woman this incident was the first time actually so my mom doing something really amazing for me there was also another guy double creep me out and say really suggestive comments my mounted nothing about that guy constantly just said he needs help and let it alone until my uncle decided to take it into his own hands on the time when i was i think about i was interested in adult books i would listen to the audiobooks and one day my mother found out instead of telling me that this was not okay to do at my age she decided to also tell me that she was r worded honestly make me so disgusted off sex that i would want to vomit if i thought of it now on it starts to get worse at i had to do home schooling because my mom was relocating i was losing my friend its not to tell my mom that i hate it to a random i started reconnecting with my also abusive father the funny thing is my mom calls him abusive but they also have the same personality are you eventually just cutting off due to something so you decided and by i decided my mom decided and the things he did was to my mom try to make her pay for his other childrens things he has children including me yes he did sleep around since then i never had a good mental health i constantly contemplated ending things and i constantly had the chance to this time i was in hospital for a its significant growth in my brain the only way i could communicate with friends whats through messaging and emails that because i was not allowed to have those things due to the growth i lost content with almost all my friends except for one for so long i had no one and my mother never made things better everyday she would start a fight and even if you keep quiet and dont respond to her she would continue degrading you there was a hair stylus double come to my house and she would stay for just days she must have my sister saying that my mom is straight up abuser and she wants to cut her of my mom will constantly diagnose me a psychological liar a sociopath a narcissist and tell me that im the abusive one she would hate me to the point where we can turn to black and blue one day she found out that ive been trying to kill myself she tries to help me out and i try to build a better relationship between us think so seem to be going well and so she decided to say that you just trying to kill yourself because i had punished you im just trying to raise you to become a good person that was the day i realized i do not have a mother i try to kill myself because ive been pulling my whole life i lost all my friends i dont have friends i recently had to cut off my dad and its not worse because one of the side effects for a pill i am taking whats literally thoughts of selfharm she have to making me feel like a sorry excuse for human being by saying that i didnt tell the psychologist anything about her doing all these terrible things cuz i was afraid that cps will take me she said that i wanted them to take me fast from repeat she declined and i havent had therapy in one year now i can feel myself slowly regressing and losing all the work i put in for my mental health what makes things even back to the reason kicking out incident but happened a year ago the whole human started with her stating that maybe you deserve to be bullied turn to dad then she said im catching you out of my house because you decided you can be your own parent i leave and i try to go to my sisters dormitory she eventually find out that im talking to my sister and trying to get there and she starts playing up the water works she only wanted me to come back im so that i can give her the things that i took with me which was my laptop and my phone tell me eventually had a conversation and im told her that she is emotionally unavailable as well as the fact that she is a workaholic and excuses always that she has to save lives nursing manager the two nursing managers at the hospital there was more i should have mentioned but every time i

ten years ago when my little girls were and there was an incident at my parents house my mother is an alcoholic and in a tantrum she had convinced my girls that i had hit her i was healing up a broken leg and the girls were visiting me at their house from out of state immediately after this happened my parents put them both on a plane and sent them home to their mother my ex wifeand news that i had assaulted my mother spread throughout everyone in my life instantly i could not defend myself because there were too many people involved who saw benefit in supporting this version of the story it was like that by my mothers design to begin with now ten years later one of my daughters has reached out to me but reconnection is on my mothers terms because she has held on to her influence over her the moment i expressed any anger my daughter immediately said i wasnt ready and blocked me again we were so close and happy before this lie was told and i have a really hard time accepting that everyone still thinks i assaulted my mother and that i should be thankful to her for the chance to reconnect i have missed them so much and missed out on so much in their lives i dont expect my mother to apologize or set the matter straight and her terms seem like they have been set for my failure further reinforcing her hold i have no support on my end and i am struggling with how to handle the situation on my own i cant take advice from anybody who doesnt believe me because it doesnt lead me to a solution thank you for reading my post,Positive

for context ive been going to this church for years and i started singing in the worship team when i was for extra context i live with a very emotionally and verbally abusive mother who knows how to manipulate the narrative and always makes herself the victim even in situations that are not from her life this will be important later in the pandemic my mother exploded my stepfather and i would have weeks of peace at most and then she would get very aggressive and impulsive for around two weeks as well and then she would get very depressed threatening to take her life if we ever left her my church leaders knew about this because at that time i couldnt afford a therapist and i just needed someone to talk to i thought i could trust them fast forward to last year and it all came crashing down for me i started feeling like i didnt belong in the worship team anymore and i felt alone because they spoke awfully about mental health issues on my side i got tatted and i will admit that i knew it was against our doctrine but i honestly felt so at peace with myself and with my spirit and i dont believe ive sinned against god but then i went to church and they told me every comment and insult that you guys can imagine that i was too emotional and impulsive that i should keep quiet whenever i didnt like something about the church because i was speaking badly about the bride of christ that i wasnt the example they wanted kids to follow they werent sure i was fit to be a mother even though i was biologically ready im to bring a child in this economy and world sir please and they know im sensible to words because of years of verbal and emotional abuse from my mother i later got to know that they had meetings about me without me including my mother in which they talked about me debated on whether to let me stay on the worship team or not what they were going to do with me etc my mother had some influence in there and even though they have seen physical proof and heard recordings and videos of how she treats me they chose to believe whatever it is that she told them to this day i dont know what it was i started going to the psychiatrist a few months ago and i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my psychiatrist also recommended that i change churches and if things became too bad with my mother proceed legally i feel so lost and scared and i dont know what to do i left the worship team even though i loved singing and praising jesus and i also love my mother i know that she can be a good person but it is so hard to love her that it hurts its like hugging a rose with thorns and i feel like im walking on eggshells every day am i in the wrong,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
ive been in a relationship with my girlfriend we are both in our early s for almost years now she has been wonderfull to me the whole time and i dont think i know anyone more underestanding and open in my life she is incredibly smart and amazing at getting how and why people feel or act in certain ways she comes from an average home some stuff hasnt been great but generally her parents are good people and have give her a sense of safety she counts on them and talks to them all the time and she trusts them to tell them issues she deals with i on the other hand come from a bit of a complicated situation my parents have been for as long as i can remember psycologically verbally heavy on this one and sometimes even phisically not very common abusive to me our relationship has gotten a lot better the past year and i cant say i hate them for what they did to me ive been going to therapy for around years as well and only recently started really digging into the abuse and realizing how wrong it really was i came to the realization a few weeks ago that i want to tell my girlfriend if not all of it at least enough that she can truly underestand whats so wrong with me im fucked in the head and ive known that for a long time but i feel like if i dont explain myself a little she will never truly underestand the reason why raised voces scare me why i cry when a stupid movie shows a good parents why i panic when something gets droppedbrokenspilled there is also the matter that i recently realized i dont know how to tell when someone is being violent if they arent yelling and hitting my therapist says thats because i register anything below that as safe due to how i grew up but i find that very scary im afraid i might have been violent without realizing or that i will be at some point she usually is very quick to tell me when something bothers her and she has been an angel with that because im not the quickest to underestand social things but she always takes the time to make sure i got it and i always try my best to better myself for her she deserves only the best but its a scary thought nonetheless ive been thinking that i should tell her about all this or at least a part of it so that we can keep building a healthy relationship and also because sometimes i feel like im miles away because i cant explain whats going on in my head im unsure as to how or when and an irracional part of me is scared to death that she will think im exagerating or wont believe me my therapist said it would be best to discuss it after im done healing but i honestly dont feel confortable just ignoring the elephant in the room completly ive made some coments here and there before so she already knows i wasnt raised quite right i just wanted to vent a bit and hear you all if anyone has some advice or ideas its my first time posting in this subreddit so if im breaking any rules please let me know,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i guess its kinda logical after me refusing contact for nearly years but im still mad she still had a way to give them to me through my dad but decided to rather make a quick buck of it some of the things are expensive video games and books i cherish very much i couldnt take everything with me and knew i would never see them again but actually knowing theres no way of getting them back is crushing me update i did something stupid and messaged her on a burner account telling her that instead of selling my belongings she should give them my dad i also told her no matter if she accepts it she abused me and that no contact is the best for both of us i know this was extremely stupid emotions were too high theres no way to delete the message i dont know what i should do i guess i have to fess up to my dad since they will probably contact him but im too afraid having to confront my emotions and my weakness,Neutral
i am grown up man not good with social setting i think my family try to embarrssingn me on puropse i was just sit with my dad he immediately says about me negative comments he exactly said you look more hondsome and then told me my hair is very long and there is dark spot in my feet i got the same behavior with young brother same attitude for example i say something funny he says he is smart sometimes both try to humilate me in family gathering like my brother shouted loud out of nowhere that i spent years jobless and looking for a job in family gathering i just dont react what is the best thing to answer for this kind of behavior,Neutral
i am currently f and i just moved out of my abusive household my family was both physically and emotionally abusive more so emotionally as i got older the constant putdowns never really stopped even just a month ago my mom does love me but she says awful things like telling me to die when shes upset and this has been said to me my entire life i dont speak to my dad or my brother because they are the same exact people walking around my home felt like eggshells because i was constantly being judged and criticized for being a normal adult woman my father hated the fact that he could not control me and did not show me respect he has called me a whre for wearing a normal black dress my brother learned to treat me badly because of my dad the depression and anxiety got so bad that i was thinking heavily about suicide now that i am finally free i dont think ive fully processed it yet until now and its been days to be exact i guess i feel safe more free to be myself without any criticism,Positive
many of my m abusive experiences took place while eating in family at the kitchen table one of the phrases i remember the most from my father is seeing you eating grosses me out until my teen years i was frequently scolded screamed at and even physically hit during meals for being a picky eater i was literally afraid of eating with my family this caused me several problems with food this is not the first time im opening a thread about this but one problem in particular that ive only noticed frequently is that i seem to get some sort of anxiety or panic attack when somebody gives me a more or less dedicated meal and i dont eat it for not liking it it has happened to me at least three times in the last one or two years once with friends once at my job and once at a restaurant i grew up receiving nothing but violence for just saying i didnt like the food i was given and up to this day it looks like i still react with fear when i reject food i wonder is this just me does somebody else suffers or suffered from something similar,Neutral
i finally see it that family thats doing things the right way theres no guilt no parentification no anger no harm but theres love compassion and understanding the kids get in trouble but the parents take the time to explain why theyre in trouble and what they should have done differently i know i dont see whats going on behind closed doors after i leave their home but its shocking to see how happy they are ive told them theyre good parents but i dont think they believe me how do i explain it better without burdening them with my own trauma theyre insightful im pretty sure theyve guessed already,Positive

i can handle having conflicts with outside people i can handle being in verbal heated arguments with someone but when it comes to my mom insulting me using my weaknesses or flaws against me my god its such a sour pill to swallow to know that i cant even confide anything of my personal life to my mom in fear of her using it against me ive always thought family is meant to help each other become stronger to help each other overcome obstacles not to tear each other apart over every mistake maybe im still too naive if i cant even put my trust in my own family member who else can i trust im sorry for venting if someone is dealing with abusive parents i hope you still hang in there keep going become stronger it sucks so bad i know,Neutral
they are like the smartest people i know yet do and say the most ignorant and oblivious things my dad put hands on me unjustly period he doesnt usually do that but he still did it multiple times and my mom at times too so i go to the counselor not to call cps literally just vent she listens to me and then files a report without my knowledge you dont even have a say in it like that yet my mom loves blaming this on me that is literally the reason they came and my dad wants to be like well you shouldve come initiated conversation about religion and lgbtq shit cuz i left and im bi with me while just ignoring the fact that he put he tossed a computer at me and hit on me multiple times throught multiple months on n off now the cops sent some mail n stuff and my mom months earlier got a call bout the cps people escalating this i dont even think my dad is abusive ig but he has done some abusive stuff and ive said that multiple times the thing is they dont listen to me so it kept happening on and off but it happened not even that too it was just mentally taxing even talking to them bout this religious stuff then they just blame it all on me edit watching this vid on gaslighting and theyre literally doing that making me feel small and literally trying to change reality like they keep blaming my actions for why they keep when in reality the counselor listened to what i was telling her which was me just explaining what happened not some cry for help and yet they insist that it was my fault were also black so he brings that into it and the system which is valid but then tells me how im trying to work with the system implying he knows more about it even though they keep blaming me for this like i dont want to talk bout how u think bein trans is weird and how me not being apart of any religion is weird i told them my opinion they have told me theres now i really dont want it now and they wont respect that im and i still live with them and thats even more tricky cuz now they feel like they own me or get the right to treat me however or say whatever i dont know what to do even my peoples dont know some of em even abandoned me not even listening to me,Neutral
ive just graduated high school so i feel like i can say more now than i could before but is my dad abusive i believe myself that he is verbally abusive manipulative a narcissist and mentally and emotionally abusive i think it kind of started after he came back from the military i mean hes always been strict but never to this extent he has said a lot of things so called out of anger like how he wanted to strangle me how if he has the option to not deal with my sister he wouldnt have had he at all how if we wanted to kill ourselves we should just do it and get it over with so he can clean up the mess and he says he doesnt mean it in that way what otter way can we take that coming from our dad my father has only ever worked his whole life so he tries to get us to help around the house which i had no issue with until he started just nagging it was something i wasnt doing right every time i didnt clean the kitchen the right way i dont cook enough i dont consider peoples feelings and not even with chores in the house im a kind of curvy girl and all he can ever tell me is how far im going to get if i dont work out i do or how ugly my back looks in some dresses he even said i looked funny in my prom dress this morning he came to blame me about protein powder assuming i used it all and started hurling remarks at me when he was the one who used it last i really cant take it anymore especially after my sister got in trouble for liking a boy and my dad told her he would only want to get in her pants and lifted her shirt to point at her boobs he yelled at her that boys would only want that from her she was wearing no bra i dont care if he is my dad but that should have never happened we are girls and he is a man that much self respect should be in his head but it isnt i havent even mentioned him throwing a knife and glass shard at my sister and me telling us to kill ourselves infront of him we wanted to at one point and slamming me against my dresser one time just because i was journaling my thoughts he does this thing where he forgets stuff on purpose to make us feel dumb or stupid about what we reminded him about too and its used on our mother too if its not his way then its no ones way a lot of our acting out was triggered by him he was the reason i tried to run away cut myself a little the start of high school and developed really bad depression though i can never just talk it through with him so is he abusive,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my life story tw this is my story ive recently on another account been going around reddit and trying to help people especially children get out of abusive situations and to help people learn how to cope with their past abuse ive been getting questions on how do i know so much and is it due to me having to deal with things in the past and the answer is yes i want to grow my charity i guess that is what you would call when im older so i can help more people so here is my story my life started when my druggie of a mother and my alcoholic of father got together and they had me i was born deprived of the nutrients i needed and for some reason the doctors thought this was okay and didnt report my parents i was dumped at relatives house and moved around for years till i was shoved back into my parents house and things just then got worse my parents attempted to put me in a sex trafficking ring for money but the deal somehow didnt work out and i was never officially put in however they later made me become an altar girl and you know how that turns out the priest molested me about six months until other parents took him to court where he found not guilty on all charges my mother and father never got better they laid off on the drugs slightly but they were still extremely abusive at the age of three i was tied to my bed for days and was beaten with belts and sticks just because i scuffed my really old shoes my mother has strangled me on numerous occasions my father has molested and i strongly believe he has raped me the memory is really fuzzy i was forced to work at the age of so i could eat food i was told the world would be better off if i died and that no one would care if i was gone i was told im a cruel person and that im ugly and stupid i was beaten so much altogether i have broken bones i have been put on drug runs for them starting at the age of they have attempted to drown me poison me and more they have sold my things on ebay and facebook so they can pay for expensive clothes and furniture at the age of i moved out to my great aunts house she was very very very poor and i went without eating some nights but it was better than living with my parents she was also very sick mentally and she would kick me out and bring me back in i moved out again to my parents as i was forced to and she later died when i was living with her my parents tortured and killed my cat at i moved into my grandparents for about a month until i was forced to go back with my parents my grandparents never believed what i was saying and blamed me for everything saying i was insane and ungrateful for what my parents did do right at this point i had had enough and i went and reported my parents and family to the police and child services for the abuse i had endured i am now in a very long brutal court case with against my family everyday i am trolled and harassed for speaking my story by family exfriends and complete strangers on the internet i am not sharing my story for sympathy points as i have been accused of i just want people to know that they are not alone im still trying to heal from my past i know what i was missing and want to give that to people that who need it thank you to whoever is reading,Neutral

hey i just created this reddit account just so i could ask this question i am a teen about to enter adulthood just graduated from high school basically my father always gets mad at me whenever i do something wrong which while seeks normal his triggers and reasoning is what is odd for some perspective one time my father lashed out at me in a public restaurant because when i was trying to get my straw out of the paper i accidentally bent it i didnt have a reaction to bending the straw it wasnt his straw i wasnt a worker there fumbling my job or something we were just eating dinner at a restaurant and i did nothing that day to trigger him everything was going well up to this point he just got mad at me for accidentally bending my own straw this was no an occurrence that happened when i was really little or something this happened earlier this year so you can imagine how easily my dad gets triggered by my mistakes he would also yell at me for being nervous which always seemed counterproductive to me but maybe im wrong he would insult me get mad at me for not wanting to spend time with him and when i would try he would continue the cycle and to be clear i dont hate jokes towards me i think its perfectly good to have a friendly laugh at each other but this wasnt that hed be putting me down and then get upset when i didnt want to be around him hed hate it when i cry which i guess i could understand no one likes crying all the time but what stuck out to me is that he told me he would stop getting mad at me and start trying to solve problems calmly with me once i stopped crying so with time i learned how to hold in my tears but my dad didnt keep his word he still got angry with me all the same i kept trying until around my last two years of high school now i just wait until im all alone to cry he also once threatened that if i ever got him sent to prison once he got out he would show me what it was like to get beat up this was because he once got into trouble with the police because i was scared he was going to beat me up i did not intend for my dad to get in trouble with the police but i was really scared my dad never punched me but he did spank me once with a belt i remember crying and begging him not to do it and he would yell at me to turn around i was usually in trouble because of school i am special needs and struggle with behavioral problems but something i did notice was my behavioral problems were either better or worse depending on what teacher i had my behavioral problems were at their worst when the teacher was a jerk meanwhile when i got lucky and got teachers who were nice people i did quite well in school it didnt help that my dad didnt even realize i was special needs until the third grade but his temper didnt change the only thing that did change was how loudly he yelled at me because we also found out i had sensitive ears so his yelling was literal torture for me this doesnt mean he stopped yelling just now he wasnt putting his all into it but anyways back to the whole threatening my life thing you probably thought this happened after he spoke with the police you probably thought that was just something he said in the heat of the moment nope my dad getting in trouble with the police happened when i was in nd grade my dad threatening my life happened when i was in th or th grade and i had never threatened to call police on him once i never even once threatened to tell anyone how he treats me he just decided it was a good time to remind me of how easily he could kill me and he didnt play it for a joke he played it straight my dad also try to weaponize my interests anything i was enjoying he would use it as a means to insult me or punish me i once told him i felt this way and he told me to my face that he is going to weaponize my interests which surprise surprise led me to being much more secretive about what im into which led him to being upset that i started being so reclusive he also wanted me to feel bad for caring about my friends during the pandemic i spoke to people from my school online and during a conversation with someone they opened up to me about how they arent doing well mentally and was thinking of killing himself i of course was worried about him but when my dad asked what i was doing and i foolishly told my dad i was worried about my friend he made fun of me and my suicidal friends this mockery of me caring for others even continued at dinner when he thought it was hilarious i was worried someone wanted to end their own life i wish i didnt let that affect me getting friends once the pandemic ended because now i have hardly anyone to turn to for help which is why i had to turn here my dad has also refused to teach me how to do certain things like laundry one summer i asked him to please teach me and he didnt he also would be too tired to cook dinner buy take out and then complain about how i always want to eat out and how its costing him so much money there are plenty more times when my dad thought it was appropriate to lash out at me but those are just the times i immediately thought of now im in a position where im so scared to be thrown out of my house because hell be legally allowed to and ill have no where to go i will starve my dad ever since i was little had always told me he spoils me so i always have this thought maybe hes right im just overreacting i know i told all these like im the victim but maybe im just a brat my sad does plenty of nice things hes given gifts to me but i dont want him to buy whatever i want i just want to be able to spend time with him and not have to worry about getting yelled at i love my dad i want him to be proud of me but i often feel like im not the kid he wants he wants someone else someone from his generation he always complains about my generation im not the kid he wants i just hope he loves me at least a little,Positive
argued with my mom over something so ultimately inconsequential she didnt even apologize after she realized her mistake ofc she didnt cause she never fucking does i said she doesnt even care and thats the worse part she said of course i care i said no she didnt because if she did she wouldve gotten an abortion knowing she wouldnt be able to care for teens and a set of twins i couldnt stop crying in the shower when i came back to the room i had to ask her why she couldnt have just stopped at kids why why why did you have to bring me to this fucking earth why mom why did you do this to me,Neutral

about years ago my seperated mom and dad got into a huge fight over a ridiculous thing this whole thing resulted in her calling the cps lying and exaggerating about my dad and his mom neglecting my little brother that is years younger than me her lies started an investigation by the cps that lasted a couple of months but resulted in nothing due to this and a lot of different factors but the final straw being a two page a message about how shitty of a son and brother i was to my younger brother after i the day before told her maybe when she asked if she could eventually borrow one of my monitors in the future i went no contact with her and has been in no contact ever since she also went on about how she regrets every good thing she ever did for me and bla bla bla the fucking entitlement holy shit a couple of months before this she also committed a fake suicide after i and my dad distanced ourselves from her she swallowed some ibuprofen not nearly enough to kill and called the ambulance she later admitted that it was a call for help and that it was not a real suicide attempt even before the first call to the cps my mother once told me how my brother once told her that he wanted to live at her house which is a totally normal thing for a year old to do especially when you straight up ask him if he would want to live at your house and of course it doesnt actually mean that he wants to move there full time fast forward to late the cps got anonymous complaints which resulted in an investigation once again but this time they actually had a reason to be worried since my brothers mother who he stayed at every other week was not doing well physically which resulted in my brother staying home from school a lot due to depression brought on by the worry about his mothers health after a couple of months of investigating they decided to transfer my brother to my mother and i dont for the life of me understand why the cps didnt just give my dad full custody over my brother since of their worries were about my brothers mom they have yet to give him a logical reason for their decision which probably means that my mom has been talking shit about him to the cps during the my mother decided to help dad and my brothers mom in the case she was playing extremely helpful the whole time her goal of course being to take full custody over my brother the whole time which even looked like the best option in the end since the alternative would have been a whole different family so my only alternative right now if i want to retain my relationship with my little brother at the same level is to resume contact with my plotting manipulative probably psychopath mother she won my dad and my brothers mom doesnt seem to understand that they were being played and manipulated from the beginning and i dont know if i should tell them or not and a part of me want to believe that he just happened to be placed there by chance and that she wasnt plotting at all to begin with what would you do in this situation,Positive

and she immediately gave me that angry hateful ugly look that makes me see red every time my brother and i basically had zero friends growing up due to severely stunted social skills thanks to mother i love her i really do and i had good memories with her but where are the memories with friends and classmates there are none because she was a huge control freak she was always paranoid that the worst would happen to us so she didnt let us go anywhere to even make friends we only played with the super sweet filipino boy neighbors because they were neighbors whenever my brother and i would mess up in the slightest or if it wasnt our fault she would hit us and say you cant do anything right being isolated from mostly anyone else that wasnt family made us internalize all the ways she was being toxic to us she doesnt wanna admit it but i just know the angry outbursts against us was her frustration from working two jobs to support us because she was too stupid to find a man that wasnt an alcoholic deadbeat fuck face ooooh then she started going to church and reading the bible so she can feel like she became a better person but shes still stuck in her own ways im transgender and the only people who didnt accept me were her and her lapdog my stepdad of course she used religion as an excuse for her toxic ass ways i still dont think she fully accepts me to this day now to the actual topic of the title my brother moved many states away to be with his lover and is happy there of course my mother being the control freak felt like she was entitled to a text every day its not unreasonable but the way she is when my brother takes days or weeks to respond is unreasonable she would get on my case to text him to call her but of course i barely took her seriously today she told me that he still hasnt called she pitifully whined i just dont get why he doesnt want to i wanted to say because you kept him from having a real life but it came out you werent always the best mother and then came that piece of shit ugly ass spiteful face i immediately barked dont give me that look im done taking that from you and immediately went to denial i just left because she clearly cant handle the truth that my brother and i went through so much bullying and so much loneliness because her control mattered more than to actually see us grow as individuals it just makes me sad thinking she wont ever change her ways and that my world will get even smaller besides my bff roommate i have no friends and maybe losing my mother due to her stubbornness will leave me with practically no one in my world,Positive

extremely neglectful to them mostly but she also actively encourages her other older children to commit credit card fraud she was recently arrested and the last thing she said to her yearold son was looks like youre going to have to take up the family business thats what she calls her fraud scheme now her yearold daughter who came all the way from florida to attempt to kidnap my older brothers children wants to talk about how shes not dumb because shes the one making money without even having to step a foot outside this is after her mom apparently didnt even have any contact with her for years im thinking this whole entire family is fucked their mom would also just straight up buy weed for her son and her other younger daughter she herself is a coke addict and would constantly bring strange people into her home where she had two infants they didnt even have their own bedroom shed given their bedroom to their older brother and they just slept in the living room on a mattress since my brother has finally realized shes a crazy bitch who never wanted to be a happy family with him hes been learning how to be an actual father my mom is actually able to visit them now that she doesnt have to deal with that wench either and theyre literally different children it just disgusts me that every time my mom reported her to cps they did fuckall not even when she reported that they were found with really weirdly specific wounds they just knocked on her door and shrugged when she didnt open the door ig,Positive
im not totally sure if my parents are abusive or not so i wanna see other peoples opinions so my dad cheated on my mom when i was about and he moved out shortly after before then both my parents were absent in my life because my dad worked during the day the only times i would see him would be early in the morning or late at night and my mom worked nightshift so she would often sleep during the day i wasnt mistreated i got fed and watered but i feel like i never had much interaction with them after my dad moved out me and mom left left to live with another man she found he was an amazing guy until he began using drugs and asulted my mom one night i did not witness it but i remember the day it happened a little after that my dad met my stepmom they started dating and she would often say things like i dont want a kid or i dont like kids in front of year old me eventually she stopped after my mom confronted her about it but the fact she even said anything like that really bothers me i started public school for the first time right after my th birthday since i used to be homeschooled i loved school and it was like a place for me to actually have fun in second grade my best friend and her mom and sister moved in with me and my mom i was so excited but me and my friend hated each other for the next two years her mom would always treat us unfairly babying my friend and yelling at me i understand i wasnt her child but still my mom would often take me and my friend to the store or her work to avoid my friends mom and i am pretty sure she played a major role in me being suicidal in rd grade dont worry i got better now at my moms house several years later there is stuff everywhere the house is a huge fire hazard it isnt as bad as those houses on that horders show though and i think the place just stresses me out so much that i dont want to help clean up instead i do things to keep my mind off of everything my mom also talks about her problems with me even after she has said it is a form of abuse my dad isnt a big issue but he is a very passive parent he doesnt take me to doctors appointments or make sure im not getting into trouble but i think my stepmom is the worst probably the best way to describe her is that its like im walking of glass around her one wrong move and it breaks and lieing to her is like there is a crack in the glass and i try taping it sometimes it still breaks and sometimes it doesnt i dont get yelled at or hit but i cant do anything i really enjoy without getting either scolded or in trouble i am a therian and i do a sport called quadrobics which is where one runs and jumps on all fours when i do quadrobics my stepmom would say something like if you act like and animal we will treat you like and animal even though i am just being myself she is overprotective as well i cant climb trees or talk to strangers online whatsoever she has rules for me that she doesnt follow herself like how i am not allowed to interrupt people because its rude though for some reason she is allowed to interrupt me anyway i could keep going and going about these people but im not going to i dont want to write a whole novel lol if anyone knows if this is abuse or not and if anyone has any ideas on how to cope with it i am all ears i have tried therapy and journaling but neither are for me thanks,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hi i live in the uk f and i really want this story to be known this is going to be long because this is a decade worth of information and i have issues with remembering times and orders of things so it might get messy this is also very unbelievable but i assure you i can prove this is all true my mom and my dad split up when i was a child maybe ish my mom stole money from my dad who worked hard to support us while he was at work a guy would come knock on our door which id sometimes answer big biker dude hed ask for my mom if i answered and it turns out he was selling her ketamine i was just answering the door to her ket dealer as a literal child my dad kept ferrets and lurchers and my mom had a chihuahua when they split she kicked him out and proceeded to starve his animals the ferrets all starved to death the lurches mother and adult pup were starved too when rspca found them the pup had only survived by eating the carcass of the mother i think my mom hid them in a black bag her dog the chihuahua was fine though she lied about trying to commit suicide when confronted i saw it all and still have nightmares about that night she stopped me seeing my dad but my dad fought hard to try and see me i cant remember much of this time but she managed to get away with separating us guess the court just fucked up she made me go by my nans last name so i couldnt be found my dad would never stop looking for me nor his side of the family but they had no idea shed made me go by another last name she started going out with lots of different men at the same time i remember seeing a new guy in the house each day i remember asking why so many people were coming over while a guy was there once and i got told off afterwards this part gets especially messy she meets a guy who sticks around big irish guy has a daughter we end up living in a place with them she leaves all our belongings in the house i grew up in didnt take my baby photos clothes anything of mine took her own stuff though and i think it all gets chucked in a skip when the house goes up for sale fresh start with the new guy i guess im not gonna sugarcoat it she started showing me pictures of intimate parts of the body i was still a child i couldnt have been older than she gave me massages and made me give her some we were made to bath together and share a bed single bed originally i was molested so fucking much i didnt even know it was wrong or abnormal so i never said anything i just carried on with things there are lots of things from this time started going to school secondary school which was hard because when we went to live with the irish guy she just took me after school one day and we never went back didnt do my gcses so every school i went to treated me like i was stupid her and the irish guy break up messy i think got physical she dumped me at the house of the friend i made for months i didnt see her for months didnt hear from her my friend got abusive would beat me up when i went to eat food id lock myself in the bathroom so she couldnt hurt me shed give me a plate of food to apologize it would repeat she came back we moved into a place just us she met a guy he started grooming me somewhere before this we were in a hostel i only found out recently when i was told but it came back i have memories that lead me to believe i was rped this is already a long post but im not even halfway through my story i guess ill carry it on another time if you read this far thank you ive been so desperate for someone else to know what has happened someone outside of the few friends i have in my life right now sorry if any of this doesnt make sense or such im just typing it out the way it comes out of my brain rambling and stuff at at night ciao,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mom emotionally abused me badly but my dad never found out bc he traveled for work a lot he thinks im distant and unable to talk abt my emotions bc of him and thinks its bc of something he did i cant tell him abt my mom bc it could hurt their relationship and they love each other and i dont want to taint my dads image of her but i have no one to talk to and my dad is probably the only one who would understand bc he was abused when he was a kid its just not fair that i had to go through all that just for my mom to act all nice about me now that ive moved out and talk about how such a great person i turned out to be and to act like she always loved me in front of my dad and on social media and i have to live w it alone its not fair that i had to go through that and now i cant even talk to my dad or talk to him without crying anymore and what she did is hurting my relationship w my dad in addition even if i told my dad he might not believe me bc emotional abuse is seen as less severe than physical and theres no proof of it,Neutral
hello i made a post in askuk or so months ago about my mothers emotional abuse of my sister they wouldnt let me post the update so ive resorted to trawling reddit for other places to seek advice so sorry if this is wrong too on the back of that post i reached out to the nspcc uk child neglect abuse charity for support they then reached out to my local social services on the back of this who then went to see and speak to my mother they raised the concerns with her and had a little look around the house and that was it they didnt make any attempts to speak w my sister with her mother telling her the social was happy and the case was being closed i then reached out to the social myself letting them know it was me and that i was concerned noone has spoken to my sister they then set up her head of year at school to have a chat w her with him reporting back to the social what shed said according to my sister he reassured her what was happening wasnt okay and he understood her feelings being in this position the social did nothing i kept the social up to date w any new developments from the home further instances of how my sister was spoken to how this impacted her emotional and mental wellbeing and a recent incident where she had agonizing tonsilitis but her mother refused to acknowledge it or that she needed to go to a doctors that is until i told my sister id take her first thing only then did she agree something was wrong following my last two further reports to the social i havent had any responses ive noted theyre welcome to get in touch and if what i was doing wasnt appropriate to please let me know id be happy to leave them to their investigations i just wanted to offer more context of what was going on in the home well today my sister has told me that her mother has let her know the case has been closed permanently they arent taking any more action theyve decided that im effectively being vindictive and trying to get my mother in trouble this info is coming from the mouth of my mother so im taking it with a pinch of salt as i know shell be taking the closure as an absolute win and confirmation she isnt doing anything wrong further to this they also told my mother everything my sister had said in that meeting w her year head all of this while knowing they didnt even speak directly to my sister once im at my wits end nothing has changed my mother is an emotionally abusive and incredibly selfish person im really concerned for my sister as shes about to go on to college and i dont want her mental struggles preventing her from going where she wants and getting to uni shes struggling enough as it is with her gcses and has self harmed in the past the house is covered in mould years worth my mother says this is all the fault of my sister shes its not up to her to bleach a whole house i still have to buy my sister food sometimes i took her prom dress shopping her tshirt stank and had stains of mould on it she starts conversations on topics shes passionate about with i know you wont care but it breaks my heart and i dont know what to do i dont have the space or money to house her until shes able to run off for uni were looking at her moving in with her grandmother for college but its up in the air everyone seems to agree shes in the wrong but the official channels who are supposed to help cant be arsed to do anything or even tell her mother that their relationship isnt healthy whether they think it needs their intervention or not ive had issues with my mother myself over the years exploiting me for lifts housework money being downright horrible when i moved out with my fiance being absent during the planning and my actual wedding day i did want to talk these things through but shed bail on any plans and at this point ive written it all off in place of just making sure my sister can be safe as she still lives with her im sorry for the long post im just kinda lost and my sister being subject to two more years of this shit is awful,Positive

im and i want to estrange but my parents have done nothing but help me my therapists see why i would want to leave but everyone keeps telling me about how hard its going to be and tell me that they would be a fool to tell me not to stay some even asking me over and over to stay in contact with them at least through college so that they can help me pay my parents have always paid for everything for me theyve paid for my fancy private school and theyve paid for my wardrobe which is way too large and theyve paid for all of my depression medication and hospital stays i on the other hand have never really tried to make our relationship better ive wanted to estrange from them since i was following a strenuous court case my father driving across the country and attempting to take me away from my mother by force him calling my mother horrible names and forcing me to agree and my mother egging on my eating disorder that started around by telling me that i ate too much despite being underweight and that she didnt care if i starved myself as long as i didnt cry to her about it and bother her throughout my childhood my father has always been pretty angry yelling at me knocking the wind out of my by hitting me very hard in the stomach and throwing stuff around my room making me clean it again when i didnt do it well enough the first time he also fueled my eating disorder by telling me that i was too chubby i wasnt i just wasnt underweight for the first time in my life and locking all the doors and windows in the house and screaming at me to run while laughing at me by this time though i was already pretty distant towards him and had been since i was around years old im not sure why ive been so resentful towards him my whole life but i remember crying at most of his jokes towardsabout me and wishing on my th birthday that i could parent him and my mother to teach them how to act like adults i really dont know what sparked this in recent years i fear that i have in some ways stagnated in my mental growth there have been many situations since i was young and up until last year where i yell and scream at them and cry during a wellness check last year some police listened to me telling them that i felt my mother was emotionally abusive and gaslighting me following her telling me that i could never mature as a person and become fully healed like she is and that it was crazy that i needed to heal anyways because i had never been through anything bad in life she then proceeded to tell me to tell her all of my issues with her so that she could write them down and present them to my therapist as reasons that i was fed in the head my father also has a habit of saying very wild things when hes mad almost a year ago now i told him that i didnt enjoy him and his mother calling me bad names accusing me of doing things i would never even think of doing and calling me and my hair ugly especially when ill get plenty of compliments on that style i then told him that even if i looked horrible and wouldnt get a job because of it that id rather learn the hard way that just take peoples word on everything because then id actually learn and be able to apply those lessons elsewhere in my life he responded with telling me that id end up on drugs homeless and with a gun shoved down my throat and he said that he hopes before i get shot in the head he hopes i remember him and how if i had listened i wouldnt be about to die that being said i also did something horrible and sent him an email containing all of the things ive ever written about him from english assignments to text messages to share with him all that i feel hes done wrong and how much i disliked him and the fact that it wasnt me blowing something that had happened recently out of proportion but was infact something i had felt for years he still calls me though and tells me he loves me and to call more sometimes it is me who starts being rude first i always give him one word answers and have since middle school my mother helps out to she buys me plane tickets to go see her and sends me money periodically it feels like as a kid i was hurt but now im just the worst person alive even if they have done horrible things recently i mean even if they have been horrible ive been closed off since i was a kid i even had one therapist tell me that it felt like they were trying and i wasnt this comment was made after weeks of family therapy though neither of us mentioned his comment on me being a homeless drug addict in any future where i dont follow his every word i dont know i feel like im going insane trying to figure out if it is me that ruined this that drove them to be worse to me over the past few years though ive wanted to estrange for half my life now i dont know whether theyve been abusive or if ive been sowing problems and am now punishing them by trying to get away,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

so long story short my dad has high blood pressure issues and my sister has severe depression pretty sure these manifested from events in the house my mother has always been really abusive growing up it was to my dad and even now to the point his blood pressure is very high and she berates him she states she does nothing wrong and he says he tries to avoid her she has these bouts of screaming and shouting over small things like someone moving her cooking spoon from its place for example and and my sister has panic attacks and she carries on screaming while my sister states she is struggling to breathe im worried this will push my sister to the edge growing up i was called ridiculous things and even told to die at one point i started self harming and now im married with a good man and i stopped the self harming i have always been berated by her however i dont like the effect its having on my family im at a loss of what to do in front of everyone else she looks like she cant hurt a fly i thought i was being weak until my husband joined the family and he was shocked at what he saw hes uncomfortable and cant stay in my parents house long she doesnt have any mental health illnesses as far as im aware i dont know how to cope or get help if i take any action against her she blames my father i have never seen someone with as many narcissistic qualities as well oh and she also turned her own brothers and sisters against each other by talking about them all behind their back writing this all down makes me realise how crazy it sounds,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my alcoholic hateful dad had been insulting me belittling me and as a result i ended up suicidal with severe mental illnesses negative self talk core beliefs im a failure valueless unlovable broken as in a machine and im someone who shouldnt have ever been born but whom i hold accountable the most is my mother she has been complicit scaring me into staying silent about the abuse i endured im having recurring daily nightmares about her a few days back i got an idea lets open up with my story and share it with her work colleagues lets send an email to every hospital personal where she works describing in vivid details the abuse i had to endure let each person judge her for her actions ive been told its cruel and i wholeheartedly agree with this i just cant stand her getting away with everything she doesnt have an intellectual capacity to come up with an answer more profound than a denial even if she manages to convince some of the staff that all ive written is nonsense the family reputation will get tarnished forever its satisfying to imagine having my revenge after being told to stay quiet all of my life to speak at last speak so loud that everyone will hear and make their judgement,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom and dad physically abused me while i was a kid up until i was i learned yesterday that they were in their late s and early s in this period i was bewildered to find this out since at that age i would just expect anyone to know better than to hurt a child anyway this led me to reliving all the things that they did in specific there is one episode that i remember vividly they took my glasses off so i couldnt see and also because they would frequently break them in their beatings and didnt want to spend money to get them repaired and then the two of them closed me in a room and then hit me the next day i chopped off my hair and called the police the police didnt really do much they asked me if i was getting good grades in school i was my mother was a lot more abusive than my father who would apologize afterwards but he was also emotionally abusive and controlling they normalized all of this as being culturally acceptable anyway ive been away from home since i turned i left the country to study outside of in this period contact with them was once a week and for years i was not speaking to my mother at all in this period my father came and convinced me that she was sorry and she loves me and i began speaking to her again around covid in since then i feel that i constantly lift myself up but im dragged down by interactions with her she repeatedly treats me like a child and tries to take over my life when invited into my home i live alone and separately when i point something out she yells and throws a fit like a child one recently scarring moment was when she was driving me and my brother in a car and then we got into an argument and she tried to scare me by driving the car in a zigzag and reckless manner i hit my head onto the ceiling of the car and she said it would be better if we all just died she would kill us all me my brother and her the thing is ive decided im going to cut her off completely but i still want to maintain a relationship with my father i think i do like him but its very hard for me to move on from what happened i am frequently triggered and reminded of the things he did one of the big ones being forcing me into a career that i never wanted and making me give up opportunities that were truly exceptional like a full ride to a phd at an ivy league college pursuing my topic of interest when i am reminded of his and their actions for example while watching a movie or reading a post on reddit or some other interaction i admittedly call him and start yelling at him i am only yelling and not hitting or anything but it is abusive because abuse exists in the yelling and it just brings me down for a couple of days and then i spend time trying to make up i dont know what to do i dont think its fair for me to forgive and forget because things have been repeated even recently but i dont want to be so entirely loveless either i dont know how to depart from this cycle please help me,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

this includes physical violence im crying right now as im writing this and ill probably delete later i need to get this off my chest im a f just finished my junior year of highschool i grew up in an extremely toxic household but i didnt know it at the time i thought getting regularly beat for something bad you did was normal whenever me or my other sisters acted out of place we would be beat and shoved into the closet or the bathtub and left for sometimes hours if any of us left without him saying we could well i think you could guess what happened we would be thrown out of the house during winter with nothing but a t shirt and pants i would be grounded for months for a stupid reason or he would break my electronics my phone was shattered as well as my school laptop currently im getting my car taken away forever because i said i didnt want to work at a job he wanted me to work at i retaliated of course and wouldnt give him the keys to my car it escalated extremely quickly with him screaming at my face and he started throwing breaking things in my room as soon as he threatened to hurt my animals i gave in and just gave him the keys he hurts everyone and everything when he eventually feels bad he would buy us things or take us out somewhere acting all nice as if he didnt just beat us i feel like its had my childhood ripped away from me constantly feeling uncomfortable in my own home now im an anxious person and it takes me so long to trust anyone wow that was a lot,Positive

looking for some insight here i grew up in an abusive highly religious family systemas a young child i was sad by my dad and physically abused by both parents alcoholism emotional abuse and and toxic religion were also a big part of my childhood my mom and dad have swept things under the rug downplayed a lot and flat out denied or forgot many things they both responded with anger and have tried to guilt and shame me for speaking the truth in many ways my mom was a victim herself but sadly throughout her life she was never able to see my dad and their marriage for what they were she denies that any abuse took place and is protecting my dad i havent had any sort of relationship with them for the last couple of years and have pretty much reconciled myself to the fact that i need to keep it that way recently though ive been struggling more with my sisters who still have ongoing interactionsconnections with them they didnt experience everything that i did but there was still a lot and although they believe me that i was sad they are not convinced that it was our dad and none of them have confronted my parents about how they are treating me im wondering where to go from hereshould i try to maintain some sort of relationship with my sisters or remove myself from the picture it would be an easier call to make if it were just me but i have kids who miss seeing their cousins needless to say my husband is extremely upset about everything that happened and doesnt want our family to have anything to do with my parents and the sisters who see them regularly if the situation were reversed id feel the same way but because its me and these are the people i grew up with im struggling any insights appreciated,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
one of my earliest memories from childhood goes back to when i was no more than years old i was in the preschool parking lot with my mom and dad my mom would dig her thumb into the bottom of my shoulder bone where it really hurt to make me cry obviously she did it so smoothly my dad never noticed i remember screaming and crying in pain from the top of my lungs and she was so cynically saying awww poor baby why are you crying and continue and continue i remember my dad just standing there thinking it was me this behavior continued throughout my life once she got better with her technology she would film me crying i remember growing up the abuse had gotten so bad by the time i got to school i was always to torn up when i was i ran away to my neighbors house for help and he called child protective services the problem though is that she is so good at pretending to be the best mom so they did nothing to help me i still managed to make friends though the problem was whenever i made friends she would get in the way of my relationships with them i remember in th grade she asked one of my guy friends if she was prettier than me i hope he doesnt remember that whenever i got close to someone she would ruin the relationship and sometimes even yell at my friends flash forward to senior year of high school i had gotten into an argument with one of my friends and my mom saw her at starbucks and threatened her obviously her mom called the cops on my mom to this day my mom blames that on me blames me for getting the cops called on her she accuses me of drugs and being involved with the cartel currently she is accusing me of plotting a hate crime to kill her with cartel people the most absurd things come out of her mouth i dont understand it i genuinely try so hard to be good to her and i have tried so hard in my life to be successful i am at a top university right now and her facebook is filled with all my accomplishments she takes from my linkedin she takes credit for every one of my accomplishments when all she has done is make me want to kill myself from the youngest age because i never thought i would be able to escape her im back home for summer now and its absolutely miserable i forgot how abusive and toxic she was i dont know how i am going to push through these next months i would cut her out but i have a younger sister who needs my love her behavior just doesnt make sense to me she acts like everyone is a threat to her accuses people of drugs gang violence etc but really its only her that is the problem there is so much i have to say though and since i am on a rant i want to say one more thing from a young age she started telling me my dad was a pedophile she wouldnt let me wear shorts or anything revealing around the house because of him she told me it wasnt normal for him to hug me and that he always stares as me weird so i grew up fearing my dad only to realize he wasnt even a problem but they are years apart,Positive

so a little context i was mentally and physically abused growing up and when i got older i started abusing drugs ive always had issues sleeping as in sleeping for way too long but i would very rarely dream and if i did it was apocalyptic fighting for my life well recently i quit abusing drugs and i find myself having these end of the world dreams daily and they are super vivid i can remember every single detail has anyone else experienced anything like this the dreams arent necessarily scary its almost like i enjoy them though i absolutely hate scary movies,Neutral
just been wondering about this since i dont think ill ever really recover has anyone here recovered either fully or mostly from the abuse they suffered as a child i understand that this place in some ways is not the best place to ask this i imagine that a lot of the people who completely or mostly recover are not on this subreddit anymore but im not sure where else to ask the question so,Neutral
youve probably already seen this story in this community but as a kid i remember one day my dad was angry for some reason he walked up to my brother punched him in the nose and made his nose bleed it wouldnt stop bleeding for a while and we almost had to go to the hospital i did not protect him somehow like an older brother is supposed to do what bothers me the most about it is that i didnt think much of it i actually laughed at my brother i thought stuff like that was normal i failed to show him any kind of empathy this is why i feel i cant get close to others because i know i will hurt them due to my lack of empathy i dont want to hurt anybody i cant be trusted,Positive
i f am back at home living with my parents after developing a chronic illness at university my parents swear up and down that they will treat me like an adult they havent and its been frustrating but its fine because at least im not paying rent so let me start off by saying this my dad is a veteran with ptsd and bipolar disorder so his life has not been easy by any means neither has my moms from as little as i remember my dad being angry all the time for no reason too i remember coming home to him strangling my dog one day because the dog made my dad mad by making noise ive feared him ever since and even though he gets help through the va its never gotten any better i always feared that he might hurt my sister mom or i a few years back my sister who was at the time was upset because her school gave her a big project to do over the weekend and my dad was forcing her to do the chores so i stepped in and did the chores so she could focus on school no big deal at all well my dad put our dogs outside in the blistering heat and my sister tried to let my moms dog in because he couldnt breathe in the sun like that boston terrior well he got angry and said he would kill that dog and my sister started crying so he got even more mad and stormed after her and said he would snap both of our necks in a second and not feel bad about it so i went to our garage and sent my mom a text basically the equivalence of a goodbye because i thought we would be dead by the time she got home at that night from work well my mom and dad fought and she apologized to us and he swore he would get help well for a while he didnt do anything wrong and then he slowly started again my sister was gone so all he had to get angry at was me i refuse to help him with any projects because he gets angry and i have panic attacks and start trembling uncontrollably and you cant build a porch when you are trembling like crazy he also is unemployed right now due to being on disability from the va so he gets bored and he has this image in his mind that women are below him and that because im a daughter i should do his laundry and get his food and do his chores and he refuses to put his trash in the trashcan and leaves it all around the house im returning to a local university in a few months so im trying to count down the days he gets angry when my grandmother calls my mom and says he wishes she would disappear shes never done anything but tried to care for him i fell asleep the other day because im sick and he handed me this remote to the ac well i didnt know why he did that and neither did he so i sat it on the tissue box and it accidentally fell in no big deal except i woke up to him quiet yelling at my mom about where it was and i heard him tell her that he was going to beat me up and he was dead serious of course he has no clue what im talking about when i mentioned it to him while he was in a good mood today and then he started working outside this evening and was mad i was doing college preparations and couldnt stop and help him and he walked through the house holding a screwdriver and said he was going to stab us my mom and i as his idea of a joke i guess but i know he wasnt joking he always tries to hide it as a dark humor joke i guess but he also beats our dogs especially this one old dog of ours shes the sweetest little girl and my mom originally didnt want anymore animals after our last group died because it was too hard and he said we needed pets so he took my mom to visit this pig he knew my mom is softhearted and so we brought the baby pig home because he was being abused and now my mom is trapped with my dad i know thats why he did it too if she didnt have the animals she could leave him and be able to go to her moms house and he didnt want that you cant easily lift a full grown pig not a hog but pigs are still fat and heavy either way i just wish he could understand the pain hes put us through whether he meant to or not i understand he had a bad childhood and a hard life but now my sister and i are really messed up and not even medication can help i want to get out so bad but i cant bring myself to leave knowing my mom and animals could get hurt and my mom would actually try to hurt herself if she didnt have her animals i just hate that i have to live this way when i never asked to be born the hardest part of it all is the fact that i still love him and the thought of leaving him makes me sick because i still have hope that one day he might turn out to be the dad i always needed him to be anyways thanks for reading this i just needed somewhere to vent about this i guess without worrying my family or burdening my friends advice is welcome also i would like to add just because someone is mentally ill or has bipolar disorder that does not automatically mean they are abusive or toxic so no stigmatizing please,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

title is pretty self explanatory tonight my dad dropped a framed picture and it shattered all over the floor he reacted to this inconvenience in his usual rational way by screaming swearing throwing things across the room and threatening to kill himself he leaves and slams the door leaving us to clean up because for some reason its always our responsibility he comes back minutes later screaming at my mom for something completely irrelevant something to do with how she works too much and its not how a family should be ironic coming from him an abusive narcissist my mom doesnt make that much money and earns her salary from commission meaning she has to work a shit ton this argument had nothing to do with the original reason why he got so upset but it always somehow comes back to us he threatened to leave saying this is the last fking time im saying this otherwise dad will one day disappear and then screaming is that fking clear to my mom while shes cleaning his mess on her hands and knees i cant take this anymore its constant walking on egg shells and he knows he completely controls the family since he makes more money than my mom im an only child and cant live like this anymore but if i leave im scared hell eventually do something to my mom and i wont be here to stop him i cant even bother trying to help her because she will end up projecting her anger onto me instead of my dad ive been taking antidepressants that have seemed to help my depression but how am i supposed to get any better when im surrounded by this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi i am a f living in my family home with my boyfriend m i am writing this as i dont know if my feelings are valid and if so what i need to do but if not how i need to look at myself ive struggled my whole life with mental health and self esteem however even writing that makes me feel like a prick as i know others have it worse ever since i was little i remember being screamed and shouted at for the most simple things dropping orange juice not being able to get my maths right i just remember being teased and called names stupid a clown idiot sometimes even slapped a little thinking back to that even now i still feel cold and scared i would be moaned at for absolutely everything not wanting to wear dresses or go out or having my shoes up to loose i just remember being stressed all of the time i would hide behind buildings and trees to escape them as i had no where else to go at the age of to this day im still made fun of for having doing this i started developing weird fears because of the stress i was deeply traumatised by the idea of batteries running out or being late and the worst of all still to this day high ceilings i remember feeling very alone and i would cry to try and get love and affection to stop their anger anything to make it stop for a moment if the crying didnt work i would cry louder and louder but it always resulted in headaches and being left on the floor alone there was always these weird self image threats and issues if i misbehaved my mum would threaten to cut all of my hair off which is kinda ducked up as it taught me that beauty is measured by hair length also that i had to straighten my hair for events and that i shouldnt eat too much or ill get fat and ugly my parents would also search through my room every single moment in every single corner secretly putting spyware on my phones they would never tell me this but make suspicious comments and like jokes at topics id researched or messages i sent which made me very on edge and embarrassed my dad was quite emotionally up and down also you never knew what thing would spark what reaction or the classic you kids took up all my time and made me fat but when i was little he would play with me and talk to me lots which was great he was my safe space then when i hit around it all got much much much worse my dad would self admittedly not know how to talk to me and completely emotionally abandon me my mother would be always like a hot and cold firework i never felt comfortable around her trigger so i started looking to other adult figures and role models absorbing their personalities and style to an unhealthy degree most of these role models were men as the only female role model i had would critique herself and me in the most negative way so why would i want to be that so i started not eating lunch and binding my hips so that they wouldnt grow i didnt want to become that this got worse and worse and worse as the years went on becoming more depressed and finding new ways to destroy myself but i still felt this urge to have to act normal and keep up my grades my biggest focus was art as when i was little my mum would big me up and boast to all the other mums about how great my art was it made me feel important and if i wasnt the best in the school then i was any use not good enough as my weight dropped to stone at the age of i was so so so poorly i thought that it would be the cry for help that my parents needed much like my childhood crying it need to get louder until i was heard but it wasnt much like my crying it was just met with an even bigger and angrier rage my mum would hit me and call me a freak threatening to call for me to be taken to the mad house but weirdly never did call anyone she would secretly take pictures of my body to keep on her phone and compare photos of me then to the previous year she would grab me and belittle me really psychopathically calling me too weak to fight her and to just let her win as she tried to pin me down she would always tell me that she didnt do anything to deserve this and all of the other mums are talking about you and its embarrassing and the constant classic how do you think this makes me feel on one particular morning i remember it being so bad that i climbed out of my window and ran to school when she tried to lock me in i went upstairs to the mental health room for the first time adults didnt ask about my weight they just treated me like a real human and not a possessionfreak that was the first time i felt comfortable eating in months and months this continued on up until a few years ago i was still looking to role male models and was obsessed with the idea of having an older boyfriend to look after me and care for me its all i would dream about and write about but of course this lead to a lot of male mental and physical abuse and being with narcissistic men basically to sum this all up im moving out with my current partner into a house soon woo and whilst im still living at home i feel fucking miserable an anxious shell im a tattoo artist now and i cant focus on my drawings during the day in fear of the door swinging open and being screamed at for simple things my dad doesnt talk to me he gets all weird and jittery when im near my mother continues to belittle me and control everything i do but more from just a traumatised brain she makes me feel ugly for every tattoo that i get yet demands that i tattoo her whenever she feels like it all because she helped me get the job she ruined my st birthday as we share a birthday and it was her big day just everything is about how she feels i feel deeply on edge as uncomfortable around them both i feel like a shell of a human myself and i am absolutely sick and tired of it all im not perfect but fuck me im their child whenever i try to speak to her about anything that she doesnt agree with about herself or things that i want to do make me unhappy she just shouts louder than i can calmly explain should i ditch them when i move out should i stop contact she already said that she wants a key and to come over lots and to have a tracker on my phone she also got angry when i said no i just dont think that i can live my own life and feel free until shes dead or blocked honestly i just feel so tired and broken like a bird in a cage what should i do thank you,Positive
im f my dad was verbally and emotionally abusive my whole life hes not actively evil or anything i know but he has a talent for impulsively saying the very worst thing that a person could possibly say its figuratively almost like he has a demon inside him just waiting to take control and make him say the one thing that will get past a persons armor and hurt the worst when i was growing up his rage was an allconsuming fire hes said things that will haunt me until i die hes the voice of my inner critic always telling me how worthless i am even now anyway i grew up and moved out dad went on medication but it only barely keeps him from getting arrested for yelling at waitresses and such hes tried every dosage of everything under the sun under medical supervision he knows he was a terrible husband and father i know he recognizes he has a problem and is trying to change but still whenever i see him even as an adult i have to walk on eggshells whatever his deepdown intentions his words are still not the words of a kind man and i have very little self confidence at this point im very low contact with him we live minutes apart but i see him maybe times a year well today my mom they are divorced but still in contact texted to say that dad says he misses me and loves me i know its probably true i know he really does feel bad for what hes done to my mom my sister and i but i also know that he repeatedly told me growing up that having kids was the worst thing he ever did and he would unalive himself if my mom got pregnant again so theres that so right now im torn between feeling like im coldly taking out my bitterness on an old man who cant help himself and feeling like im doing the right thing by protecting myself i feel so guilty part of me wonders if i should offer to take him out to lunch to mend fences a bit but the thought just ties my stomach in knots because i know the conversation would just devolve into him saying something terrible i dont know where im going with this maybe im just venting and trying to work through things thank you for listening,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
im years old i just completely cut off contact with my parents today and while i know that it is probably for the best i feel so guilty and sad and well mostly just really sad i miss the people that they could have been to me my mom has had a really hard life she is horrible to me and extremely manipulative but i also feel so sad for her i love her and i want to be able to be there for her but thats also not my job i guess im the child for context i moved out when i was i havent been on good terms with my parents probably since i was ive cut off contact with them once before a few years ago but we reconnected after i had a medical emergency for a while like a month lol i really did think things were better that maybe they had changed and they do love me but since then we have gotten in some really nasty arguments especially with my dad they have made it very clear that they hate everything i am and everything i care about and stand for they take every opportunity to insult and belittle me and they have both returned to their manipulative narcissistic habits still i was willing to put up with it and just have sort of limited contact the thing that changed recently was that they stopped doing the bare minimum to care for my continued survival they refused to cosign my lease to ensure that i would have a place to live for the next year i havent relied on them financially since i moved out all i really have needed from them is to fill out the fafsa form for student loans and to cosign my leases so i can have a place to live i work i have an excellent credit score and i have never missed a rent payment but because i dont make x rent landlords still require a cosigner anyway so they said because they dont approve of my lifestyle they wont cosign i found a different cosigner so that is okay so i sent them a message basically saying that they cannot really be considered parents as they dont fulfill any parental responsibilities towards me and they clearly do not like me as a person so there is no reason to continue having a relationship then i blocked them but ive been crying about it literally for hours it really hurts i dont know what else i could have done i know this really hurt my mom especially tldr i blocked my parents am sad and guilty about it,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

for some back story my sister f was with her baby dad m for almost years he was extremely controlling and abusive to her in every way it took her getting pregnant and having her baby my niece to finally have the strength to leave him because she needed to protect her baby when she was home from the hospital he couldnt handle her crying as a newborn he came into the bedroom screaming to shut the baby up he pulled out a gun and pointed it at my newborn niece and then to his own head that was when my sister knew she had to get away from himthe next day she came to my family for help and we moved her out she got a protective order against him and they had a really nasty case i court against each other cps came to interview her and i was there for support and it was the first time i had seen my sister cry in over a decade recounting to the cps what he did to her in court he lied so much about my sister and he got away with all of it because the law protects him as a parent too and there wasnt enough evidence that same cps worker high fived the dad after court that day years later and multiple court hearing later as his tactic of draining our family of money he continues to be the same person he always was my niece is much older now and able to vocalize his actions she says that he grabs her arm out of no where and twists it that he grounds her for lying about brushing her hair or showering when she says she is telling the truth so he locks her in her room for hours she says he tells her she is fat she is actually very very skinny and that her teeth are crooked and ugly she has had many breakdowns before school because of this because he has messed up her self esteem so bad she said he tickles her out of no where so hard that it hurts and it makes her cry and now yesterday when she came back from her dads she said he pushed her really hard when she was climbing into the car because she was taking too long and she hit the top of her head really hard she still had a bump on her head and then woke up this morning with very blurry vision so we took her to urgent care immediately and got her checked out and a cat scan that we are still waiting for the results for please any advice on what we can do we are terrified of what he will do to punish her if we dont succeed in getting the law to protect her after so many attempts already if we file a police report what will he do if he still gets regular custody he is about to have her for weeks for the start of summer it would be too long to share how much more there is to this case but he has gotten away with everything he has ever done im so scared that he will kidnap her or punish her for telling us or come up with another lie to take my sister to court as retaliation like hes done before,Neutral

i need some advice from my fellow netizens here im also partly venting as my mental health has gone to the dump in light of recent events i would like to know whether its a good idea to move out of my home for better context i stay in an indian household and have been raised by an abusive parent ive been subjected to a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my dad during my childhood i dont have any fond memories of good times associated with him the abuse became emotional after i grew up and started fighting back and hit a peak in i was studying for my masters degree at the time i feel like i have spent a large chunk of my life just trying to undo the damage and step away from a cycle of hatred ive taken help in the form of therapy after a lot of work i came to a position where i forgave him things seemed to be tolerable for a while it seemed like he was changing as a person but the truth of the matter is that he lies constantly ive become slightly more confrontational over the years heres the problem recently he went on an outburst bringing up everything from our past he told me how ashamed he was of me he also had issues with me going to therapy and helping myself he told me that whatever i have done till now amounts to nothing i dont have a mainstream career im an entrepreneur who runs a media and marketing agency i feel like its struggling though we operate with a profit month on month only barely unfortunately the company that funded my start up invested is connected to my dad so we work on the same floor since the pandemic ive chosen to stay with my family i can survive living by myself financially maintain my current lifestyle by saving approx of my salary financially it makes more sense to stay at home as i save approx of my salary and ive saved enough money to look after myself for the next years alone my confidence levels are at one of my lowest so far im feeling useless and hopeless about the future dont know what to do next i fear that ill end up on the streets it feels like this person is keeping my family hostage by using the fact that he is the main provider for my family i want to look after my mom and sister as well in the future but all family members associated with him end up miserable unhappy and poor if i stay back i would be there to provide support for my mom and sister,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

for context i got my period weeks after my th birthday and iv always had endometriosis so iv always had a pretty heavy flow but my mom would only buy me light and regular pads so i would go thru them pretty often about pad an hour she never really educated me about periods just that its when a woman goes through puberty and it makes your stomach hurt and you bleed that was it so i didnt know to ask for thicker pads i didnt know thicker existed i just assumed shed buy me what i needed but one day i asked for more pads bc i ran out and she got really upset with me saying shes seen all the pads in the trash and im going thru them to fast i explained that they were full and after hrs they wouldnt aborb anymore blood it would get on my pants and underwear and u could clearly see that they were soaked all the way thru she just huffed at me and said they should last hrs per pad and left and after a while came back with a box of tampons for also a little more context my mom also has very bad endometriosis but also only uses tampons never pads and had always made fun of me for wearing padsshe said i needed to figure out how to use them bc shes not buying pads anymore since i was wasting them and to read the back of the box and just figure it out if i didnt wanna bleed on myselfi kept trying to use them but i was barly i had an extremely thick hymen that it just wouldnt go thru and they just hurt so badly so for a while i just had to use them long ways or stuff toilet paper in my underwear but i had a few nice friends at school that would give me pads and i found out a specific bathroom at the school i was in always had period products and so for months i just did that and never asked her again am i wrong was this abuse shes always been very strange about my period and how it could never be as bad as her and im just so so lucky even tho i also hav endometriosis i just stage ands shes stage shes forced me to free bleed several times when i was young aswell,Neutral
what a huge relief already wow if you need context im done after the last conversation weve had i realized im done living on survival mode when he is home the convo boils down to this me its horrible to fear my own dad to feel anxious when youre around and feeling like im walking on eggshells him thats on you for living in the past dont provoque me then that last part showed me finally how little he undertsands about this and how unwilling he is to even consider that he is damaging i opened up when telling him what i wrote above my throat was in a knot it was hard to talk tears i tried communicating it in many ways the fact that he responded the way he did was the last straw maybe before i just didnt want to acknowledge it on a subconscious level even but now im unable to avoid it the conclusion is clear domestic abuse im limiting my contact with him to the bare minimum that is whats needed to live stuff around the house logistics things involving the other family members thats it im done trying to foster a warm father son relationship no fucking discussing the champions league final yes ive seen the match you too ok cool yeah aha ok goes to another room that and therapy i finally understand ive been living in the shadow of fear of fearing my own fucking dad and living in a state of survival for years a threat in our own home i see that ive diminished myself already looking for psychologists do you recommend a specific specialization im thinking one experienced in domestic violence ive heard great things about somatic stuff eye movement that kind of thing in my view the body does keep the score and i can sometimes feel it even god so many years of wondering why cant i socialize normally why do i feel so insecure etc etc all the while knowing deep down that my true self is not like that in any way and for anybody that might need to hear this abusers can love too it doesnt have to feel contradicting to cut them off from your life even when you see through their pain and know they love you even if theyve dropped everything in their lives to help you when you needed it it doesnt make you owe anything to them if they are true family they will help you no matter the circumstances or the years you have been ignoring them,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
idk if this is the right subreddit for this and i wont go into too much detail about the abuse my mother has put me through but its both physical and mental though i would say mostly mental i have dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past to the point where i even tried to actually kill myself and im right now and currently finishing up my exams i want to leave this house i genuinely cant do this anymore i dont know why im getting yelled at and literally pushed onto the floor over forgetting to fold clothes she has kicked me out once a few years ago over me not dusting off the shelves which then i ended up apologising and she reluctantly accepted and let me come back and those are a few things she has done i really just dont know what to do idk where to go or what to do in general idk how to get a job its not like they teach that shit in school i cant even let alone find a place thats hiring to begin with and even if i do i just need to get out of this house i dont wanna see my mom for the past years i was hoping a car would hit her i feel no love for her i stopped a long time ago i couldnt care about what happens to her,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
this is my first ever post on here but i need to vent because i cant tell anyone this because i dont want her to know im and through circumstances out of my control im still living at home my parents have never been the most emotionally supportive or open people while i was growing up in fact for the first time this year they told us about how they want us to open up to them emotionally but i dont feel comfortable doing so two weeks ago l my boyfriend of years broke up with me out of nowhere and ive been a mess mentally and emotionally this has obviously translated to me not being present emotionally and being absent minded luckily i didnt have any classes that week so i spent the whole week in my room also trying to study im in university and about to start exams and i let it get messy she eventually came into my room and started berating me about how messy my room is and how disgusting i am then she called all my relatives to tell them about how ungrateful i am for not being able to do something as simple as keeping my room clean then later on she asked me about why i seem so depressed and i told her about being broken up with and she basically told me to move on because he didnt matter hes a foreigner then today she asked me to get some fruit for her and i got a naartjie which i would normally peel but all the trash had been taken out so i waited till we got outside to peel it i put the naartjie in the car to peel and she just took it an ld threw it at my head without because it hadnt been peeled yet then she got mad that her car hadnt been cleaned shes the only one who uses that car and she didnt tell us that there are things in the car and then she went on a minute rant about how ungrateful i am and how i cant seem to do anything right and how my age mates are in their own houses and how she did mule a favour by raising me and buying me nice things i genuinely think she hates me and resents the fact that im still living at home its not like i want to i literally dont have a choice,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my mum and dad split around a year ago and even though it was bad before its getting worse over this time it has become apparent to me that it was always our dad taking care of us me my sister and my two younger brothers and never our mum my grandparents on my mums side are urging me to go to a counsellor at school but i dont know if what she is doing is really that bad our youngest brother has asd autism he is diagnosed and is nonverbal me and my other brother are likely autistic too but she has no intention of getting either of us diagnosed what concerns my nan is that she says our mum is neglecting us medically i told her that one of the last times i had been to a doctor was when i was that was because my mother thought i had gout due to me complaining of pain very often we went for one appointment had a blood test and she had never taken me back despite getting results that it wasnt gout due to a lack of what causes it in my bloodstream after a lot of research i believe i have fibromyalgia or something simular as i relate to many of its symptoms my pain has not gotten better and she has made no moves to help me with this she will now laugh it off when i complain of pain even though im sure she believes me it is getting very hard to deal with which is what made me mention it to my grandparents in the first place my right ankle will also lock up if i walk for mins what i did not mention is that i have had thoughts of ending it because i dont think i can live like this but every time my mum laughs it off i cant help but feel that maybe im overreacting we talked more me my sister and my nan and my sister who hasnt lived with us for months mentioned other things since our parents seperated it has been me sister and brother cleaning the entire house i will be called downstairs no matter how much my body ached to open the door for a cat often while she is sitting in an armchair on her phone she my mum said because we are younger we can do more despite her adopting all four of our cats she will never feed them it is always me i will be called down to clean the kitchen the lounge every mess her and make i am made to clean it she will say to her friends she only had us to do her work and make her rich and though everyone takes it as a joke i dont think it is my sister moved out because she was doing this work too and was still expected to pay board to my mother she will ignore us if we say anything to her and if we continue to try she will yell at us has been yelled at for telling our mother that s seatbelt had been unbuckled i remember my mum threatening to throw a kitchen knife at me if i didnt shut up she does not remember this and when i insisted on her saying that to me she said she probably didnt mean it anyway i dont know why but that really sticks with me i am expected to look after whenever she needs me too i likely have asd and to be well emotionally i need to prepare myself for it i have received no notice before just a text she was going for a coffee and that was home she says i can say no any time but i have once since i was sick and she yelled at me for being so selfish she wanted to take out for a dinner somewhere even though there is food at home most of the time she is never there for us emotionally it doesnt effect me so much im old enough to be independent but she does not pay frequent attention to i believe this is a reason for his anger issues he can not talk out his emotions and if he attempts too he will be yelled at as much as i wish to be i am not mentally well enough to help him im sorry if this is a mess im just typing this to try and earn the courage to talk to a counsellor i have no clue how it works and im scared of it does anyone have anything to help with a counselling session,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi guys i just found this subreddit i just had another fight with my mom and feel like i need some advice so ill share a bit of my story so growing up my mom has always been really angry and quick to set off she yelled and screamed a lot stomped slammed doors the whole thing she often times hit me shoved me etc the only thing she never did was hit me with a closed fist i have a little sister who is only years younger than me and i have always felt like my parents treated her a lot better than me they gave her pretty much everything she wanted even if it was at my expense they constantly tooktake her side in arguments and let her get away with a lot more than i ever did so ill get to what todays argument was about i am a full time college student and my parents are helping me out with college i told them when i started college that when i had my car on campus i would be getting a job so that i could pay them back i just got home for summer break and have not had the chance to look for a job yet because i wanted a week to relax without having to think of school or work my mom this entire past week has been making snide comments about how i still havent found a job and basically been making me feel bad for wanting some time to relax and claiming that everyone else had already found jobs so me and my sister got in an argument and my mom thought it was best to t to address it so she asked for my sisters side and then she asked for mine where i told her what happened and then she said but is that really what happened i know you trying to imply that i am a liar so i obviously got mad and she asked well what should we do to resolve this situation and i mistakenly mentioned that i was thinking about moving in with my boyfriend for the summer this sent her into a spiral where she told me that she was going to unsign her part in my lease for next year she also brought up how i was apparently crazy because i threatened to call the police on her one time then she claimed well obviously i am just a horrible abusive mother which i have never said she claims that i constantly being up what she used to do to me when i was little and claims that none of it is true so then i tried to fake apologize just so that we could have some normalcy but then she told me that i have apparently been breaking her down my entire life and have always told her that she was horrible parent and always compared her to other peoples parents when growing up she was the one who used to compare me to other peoples kids she claimed that she was done with me breaking her down and that i was apparently th abusive one now i am left questioning if thats really true or not or if im being gaslit i feel like im telling myself im being gaslit even though im not so i can not take the blame for it but thats something my mom tells me so i am just really not sure if any of it is real i mean theres no chance i could just come out of the womb and start manipulating everyone around me right there has to be a reason why i ended up like this i feel like its all my fault so am i being gaslit,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i dont know whether i should write these things down or not i feel very hopeless and depressed my life seems so bleak and nothing i can do will change that i just want to be freefree of pain free of stress and free of abuse everything that i have gone through must have meaning because if it doesnt then i might just end it all i dont know why she acts this way i did not force her to give birth to me she was the one who decided it even my own father was against me being born not because he didnt want me but because he knew how messed up she was he wanted to leave but couldnt because of me poor him i pity my father so much if i wasnt born maybe he could have left this abusive relationship he could have been free but i am a selfish person and to be honest i am glad that he didnt leave because if he had left i would have probably been sold off to someone to get married even now she threatens me with it saying that she could make someone kidnap me and force me to become their wife im only by the way so imagine that happening it isnt that uncommon in my culture in fact most of my sisters got married that way and they never left because of honor but they thought that this was the only way to escape the monsterfrom one abusive household to another my poor sisters i also pity them my father is their stepfather and although he wanted to be involved in their lives she never let that happen guess why because she was jealous of her own children one of my sisters even ran away from home and got married to someone much older than her because she couldnt take it anymore her whole life got ruined because of it and now she does the same thing to me she accuses me of sleeping with my own father since i became a teenager my virginity has always been in question i dont even do anything for her to suspect something like that she even says herself that none of my peers would sleep with me so i probably try to do it with my own bloodrelated father its sickening i dont even want to talk about physical abuse thats just my daily routine now i remember being beaten with a wooden stick for minutes straight because i didnt wait for her to pick me up from school i was nine or ten i didnt know any better and our house is minutes away walking distance one time she made me bleed from my head and i had to calm her down and apologize for making her hurt me i dont know what to do anymore my arms are full of scars and i am ashamed of showing them when my friends ask i say they are gifts from my mother today she threw me out of the house if it wasnt for my dad i would have become homeless i am just so tired i want to end it all,Positive

i just need to vent and dont know who to vent to so sorry for the super long dramatic post i guess im sharing my story in case it makes someone feel less alone because im hoping to feel that way i guess im also hoping for advice growing up my father was physically emotionally verbally abusive the physical stuff was only when i was very young it fizzled out as i grew up but the other stuff was so brutal the general overview was that i was the scapegoat from a very early age my older brother had some special needs emotional issues so a lot of my parents energy went to him and my younger sister was the baby of the family the favorite often leaving me on the outskirts any attention i did get was purely negative i think as a child i harbored some resentment towards the two of them as unfair as it is i know as an adult it wasnt their fault and i truly feel ive moved past it however the effects of only ever experiencing negative attention from my parents are horrible i was taught at such a young age that i was bad that there was something truly devastatingly wrong with me and therefore i caused all of the tension and fighting in the house my father had a hard day at work it was my fault when he took it out on everyone my siblings got in a fight it was my fault for causing the bad moods if i retaliated while being attacked physically or verbally it was viewed as an isolated incident an uncalled for uncontrollable temper when i did mess up or misstep it only made it worse everyone else was infallible while my mistakes were ammunition weaponized as evidence i remember knowing something was wrong but not having the language for it i was too young to understand and by the time i got older and had the capacity to communicate what was happening to me the manipulation ran so deep that i didnt think words like abuse applied to my situation i so deeply believed that i was bad and terrible and every other horrible thing they called me that i thought it was my fault the physical stuff had subsided so isnt it my fault that they yell i figured out how to keep myself safe eventually stay out of the way stay in your room dont make noise dont cross their paths dont have any wants or needs if you overhear slamming or yelling hold your breath make yourself smaller pray it subsides before they remember youre there it didnt always work but i did my best the only way i got through was counting down the years until i finished high school and i could get out though sometimes that number provided more dismay than comfort it wasnt until i graduated high school that i realized what it was my parents split up at the end of my senior year and it was the first time i heard someone else use the word my mother i remember when the word abuse passed her lips some part of me found it to be obvious another part of me was destroyed nothing was the same after that i had already experienced such a tumultuous upbringing and now i had to reexperience it under the lens of abuse it was like it happened twice the first year was really strange my father was overly nice overly welcoming trying to forge a connection wed never had my mother was apologetic trying to rebuild something that never was my father was afraid id testify and my mother i suppose she felt guilty for never stepping in i dont know what i felt confused angry hurt i knew my parents had been strict and unkind but downright abusive it made sense but i didnt want it to my anxiety was really bad with my father out of the house all of my repressed memories started coming back to me i was having nightmares every night i started having panic attacks i couldnt eat couldnt sleep every minute awake was spent in an anxiety attack with the occasional panic attack and every minute asleep was filled with nightmares this went on for about two months i lost about pounds this was also during quarantine so my family was stuck at home together my mother and i didnt have the kind of relationship where we could talk to one another so she assumed i was completely fine my siblings were always welcome to come to her so she knew they were having a hard time with it so her attention and compassion went to them when i started having panic attacks i talked to her hoping for some kind of help or support instead i was brushed off summer fall of that year was when things started to deteriorate once more my mother was angry and i was the recipient every word that left her mouth about me was negative whether it was to me or to someone else my mere presence and existence were enough to set her off just like as a child it was all on me everyones anger everyones moods all of the fighting and yelling it was all on me again but i was angry too i had just realized my father had abused me my entire life and that my mother had stood by while it happened not only that but she was a participant my whole childhood i know its not fair to blame her if my father was like that with my siblings and i i can only imagine what else was going on but i was a child she was an adult as a woman i have so much empathy for her as her child i didnt know how to forgive her especially when she was continuing the cycle even after my dad left the year i was was filled with constant anger and flights i always had to be on guard ready for anything her threatening to kick me out was nothing new but now that i was old enough to be on my own it felt so much more real it also felt so unjustified id yell back when i was being yelled at i was bad about keeping up with my chores but there wasnt a single instance that felt worthy of throwing me aside yet she held shelter and stability over my head every chance she got i was attending community college classes and working part time saving up as much as i could in case she followed through we lost our house that year moved to an apartment tensions only grew worse my mom was more stressed out than ever and i was more of a target than ever i worked two jobs attended classes i was never home never asked for anything paid for all of my own things never engaged with her and yet i was when it finally happened after years of being threatened with it i was a semester away from finishing my degree still working two jobs still staying out of the way my older brother and i were told my mother and sister were moving at the end of the week and we were not welcome to join the lease on our current apartment ended in two months and we were welcome to stay if we covered the bills but after that we were on our own no help my brother was two years into a full time job tens of thousands of dollars saved away while still obviously a horrible situation hed be okay but me i know is an adult but i was still in school yes i worked two jobs but they were still part time and almost all of my income was spent on school gas groceries and bills at this point i was a few months into no contact with my father when my mother told me this we didnt speak for months we eventually got back in touch but its not a proper connection the hardest part was that i was alone there was no family i could stay with no friends able to take me in no one to help me find a place or help me understand my finances and my options the tuition for my last semester of school was i would be student teaching in the mornings and working all afternoon and weekends id have to make enough money to fully cover all of my bills and necessities while spending hours a week student teaching completely unpaid on top of all of my other classes i didnt have much in savings since i had to spend most of my income to get by which meant i couldnt afford a security deposit or movers or furniture or first last months rent i lived in an expensive area where even a studio was month minimum and thats before utilities and everything else i didnt see how i could make it work i didnt know anyone i could room with and moving with strangers was a last resort i spent those two months trying to figure it out trying to accept the very real tangible possibility of homelessness eventually i found a place my grandparents help me with part of my rent i work three jobs i had to drop out of school im not in touch with my parents im now being on my own i feel a bit better not having to live in constant fight or flight not having basic necessities held over your head not being hated and terrorized just for existing its so peaceful im stressed about money and my future but it feels so much more approachable now i hate my circumstances but for the first time in my life i have a will to keep going that being said its also so difficult seeing people my age close to their families having a home and people to go back to getting to graduate college supported by loved ones financially or otherwise only just now starting their adult lives its hard a better person would be happy for them and deep down i am but im also so jealous i dont know if ill ever get to finish my degree i dont want to take out loans with no way to pay them back yes im working three jobs but the cost of living is so immense just about every cent goes to bills rent and necessities i dont see a way out but i want to find one i dont want my parents to get to rob me of my dreams in life when theyve already taken so much from me ill never be the person i couldve been if i grew up with love and support but i dont want that to stop me i know this is an impossibly long post i just needed to vent and get things off of my chest but if anyone reading this has any advice id love to hear it i know is an adult i know i should be more put together than this people are in my situation so much younger and they figure it out but i just feel so lost i want to finish school i dont want to barely get by while working jobs i want a family i dont know what to do,Positive

i have tried to understand dynamics if the role of the person who constantly goes up and down in moods between rejection and demanding attention the person who cant control their anger who is frustrated by people expressing their own actual wants and needs if it isnt what they want selfish and controlling who manipulates people with threats of suicide calls everyone names has been violent will destroy your things etc is the victim and the scapegoat then absolutely fuck that and i do not agree theres a difference between being so intensely selfish that you make everything about yourself and claim youre actually a supreme victim vs being the scapegoat this person thinks everyone is abusing them when no one is and when they dont get their way they couldnt give a shit about their parents or siblings as people or as people with equally valid needs they put themselves in dangerous positions so they are pursued because to them thats love all the while verbally abusive they arent hated by the family not at all everyone is obsessed with trying to understand why they arent ok why is everything we do causing this person pain we leave them alone after they want space they say thats demented abuse we try and talk and call and check up they block you asked to be left alone try to be close and you move wrong and theyll say how youre a bad person and always have been sick i hate this internet idea that the scapegoat is so nice and just got blamed for things what about it the black sheep is completely erratic and abusive unable to hold stable relationships with anyone never had a long term relationship and cant even keep a job then if anyone else has needs or is depressed they invalidate them completely whether parents or siblings they call everyone with needs or boundaries selfish or abusive tell me what this is not an abused scapegoat and abuser nd child who gets attention and their way through threats and lashing out i have not called the person one bad name but if i do something innocuous that they dont like they will send me a page text about how im a im and deserve everything bad that can happen to me and also they wont speak to me for a year tell me how thats the poor victim of the family the scapegoat everyone suffers in abusive families full stop,Positive
hey so i just want some unbiased feedback from people regarding if my cousins were abused growing up they both would insist they werent but the older one f same age as me is currently in rehab for alcohol abuse after her rd dui after moving across the country to california by herself shes made a lot of bad decisions over the years but she used to be my best friend when we were younger i know shes suffered from anabul for a long time and had a miscarriage when we were she has openly had issues with her dad my uncle since we were teens but has verbalized for the last few years on and off that nobody cares about her and her family treats her like shit my younger cousin m i currently live with and love to absolute pieces but hes also been through a lot his parents kicked him out during covid at the age of with no job because they were moving almost hours away and wanted to live child free ive expressed many a time how shocking this was to my cousin when he told me about it and it severely changed my overall outlook on my aunt and uncle he couch surfed for years off and on until i was able to get him a job working with me and he was able to move in with me and my best friend weve lived together for over a year now and things were overall happy but recently hes been dealing with a lot again my best friend and my cousin are both queer and a messed up situation occurred on the grindr app between the two of them but long story short my best friend ended up coordinating a voyeur event involving my cousin this has caused shock waves throughout the house obviously and my cousin has every right to be extremely upset after a lot of confusion some things were cleared up from the extra person that was involved with this and it was proven that my best friend did not touch my cousin this does not change the fact that the entire situation was effed up and orchestrated but i do believe with intense therapy for both of them that something can be worked out however i also do not believe that with all of the stuff going on with my cousin that he had any right to lash out at me in the car for explaining how i feel like our coworkers are harassing me at work for context my cousin is into edgelord dumb alt right style comedy and likes to make transphobic homophobic racist etc jokes at work sometimes the trade field i am in is almost all men and i am one of two women in our whole shop there were more before but after the last one quit for a different job all these jokes have just gotten so much worse i constantly feel like i am getting egged on for my reaction one example was last week i was told i should get stung by a bee for the experience after talking about how my grandma was deathly allergic this kind of things been happening almost weekly since january and i vented to my cousin in the car ride home i give him car rides almost every work day and he just absolutely blew up on me he screamed about how i need to get the eff over it how he has to tell me like it is because when i get upset it ruins the whole vibe for him and he just wants to have fun at work i told him that edgy jokes are fun when theyre not pointed directly at someone and he just wouldnt put himself into my shoes and continually told me to get thicker skin there was a lot more that was said but long story short he basically cannot accept that he could be wrong in this situation and even if it was all jokes if it hurts someone its not worth making them i know thats how he was raised his dad specifically gives no effs about equality woke culture etc and theyve always been very well off their whole lives so my cousins feel that anybody who has trauma or gets upset about little things need to suck it up because thats what their parents told them my uncle still calls depression the dark place i do know that hes currently in therapy but i fear that the damage to his kids is too far gone my dad my uncles brother died in and my mom is a single mom whos been working at a grocery store for years but can still find time to love and empathize with her child she was also very upset to hear that my cousin was kicked out during covid and she bought him a queen size mattress to sleep on while he stayed at her house with my sister for a few months before moving in with me i just want to know the best way to move forward with my cousins the older one in california i fear is a lost cause shes been told to move back home so many times and she just wont the cousin that i live with didnt come home last night after our blow up because i texted him setting my boundaries going forward not allowed to use my coffee and no more rides to work and texted back shooting off things to hit below the belt like my weight how i am rotting because i dont go out and see friends every night like he does etc i want to be there for him because of all the things he is going through but i also need to protect my peace thoughts,Positive

about years ago i went to counseling for the physical and mental abuse i went through growing up until i was i graduated counseling after about a year and the nightmares went away the triggers happened less and less and i finally realized i deserved all the good things that were happening to me last october i found out i was pregnant with a little girl i was never supposed to be able to get pregnant so shes an absolute miracle unfortunately all the work we did in counseling went down the drain instead of being sad i am angry im holding my belly and already wondering how someone could do the things my mother put me through i get excited thinking about having a mini me with brown curly hair and then think about how my mother would call me ugly even though everyone told me i looked like her i get to love her the way i wish i was and thats healing in itself but ever since i got pregnant my mother is now insisting on being in my life shes cringely hugged me twice now in one year and i think thats more than she has in my entire life the thought of her even holding my daughter makes me want to die what kind of mother would i be to even allow that i dont know what to do whats the appropriate way to tell her i dont want her near my child shes already badgering me about making sure i tell her when i go into labor,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

look im no misogynist i believe in equality in all things in life be it gender race religion sexual preference etc but ive been on the receiving end of a lot of abuse from women in my life my mom my sister an ex girlfriend and consciously im fully aware that people dont represent a whole gender and its not cool to hold it against them but then i get on social media and see some of the things women on there say and all and all its quite soulcrushing i dont wanna be that type of guy and above that i dont even think its fair but i cant help but to harbour some negative feelings toward women i try to remember that a lot of men have treated me pretty poorly as well and in general do far worse stuff but the psychological torment ive gotten from those women effects me in ways i really wish it didnt,Neutral

its been months since ive blocked my mom for talking shit about me havent heard from her from my grandmother i live with her and my mom lives in another country so i dont know if she knows i blocked her its not like she has ever been interested into worrying about what her daughters are doing or how theyve been but sometimes it kinda hits me because how can you cope with the fact that your daughters dont love you and you dont seem to care she just married her boyfriend so i guess theres more important things in her life,Neutral
i really am sick of this my parents have been doing this since i was the main thing is my dad my father is blind and makes it his personality hes calm at times but if your voice is tired he snaps like dont give me that additude or mumbles oh f and if you try talking serious he just sighs and ignores me on the other hand we have my mother shes been through all lot of stuff so she does have trauma i believe still one of the things she does is horrible let me play the conversation basically me mom do you think maybe you can set an appointment for me to get checked for a mental illness mom oh gr honey if i can do it without all this things today anyone can also you never show signs of any mental illness s i have looked up my symptoms and secretly checked with online doctors i have a high rating in autism or adhd but my parents are strict so knocking and privacy isnt real here for example if you close the door as you use the restroom you get yelled at for probably doing weird things in there another example if i bring up something that happened to my friend and stop speaking they need to know most times ill say no they asked me to keep it private while my dad and mom say b tell us is she doing drugs stop fing being so god darn secretive yes they openly cussed around me since birth im only realizing its bad now i do know that there is something wrong with me at night for a good minutes in my head i just hear laughing straight up laughing for minutes each night i also have very weird habits i love the sight of blood and killing just sounds funish but also horrible or something i also stalk people for fun its a weird addiction that kinda makes me excited i will physically stalk and track everything about someone and randomly stop my mom also hates that im in this phase i do not think i am in a phase and think i need mental help but i guess self harm and anorexia doesnt need help in her eyes my parents are both homophobic and are only fine with lesbians bi or gay anything else n their eyes is mentally ill fers if i came out as nonbinary lesbian my mother and father would most likely hate me,Positive

are childhood spankings really meant to be this traumatic growing i was spanked somewhat frequently by my parents up until about age and then it slowed down i dont remember much about those spankings thankfully when i was i was at grandmas house and was was spanked very hard with what i believe was to be a yardstick she hit me times as i counted i was laying on the ground and out of no where no warning or anything she somehow sneakily pulled my pants and underwear down without me noticing how i dont know and started spanking me very hard to were the bruises blisters and blood the pain lasted for about a week it hurt to sit down i remember i had to sit on a towel that night in the bath because it hurt and the water stung to the point of me crying in the bath that night it was very traumatizing and even now as a adult i still regularly have ptsd from it i wake up from nightmares dry heaving and having panic attacks over the years from it as a kid after it happened and as a adult after that whenever my parents would try to spank me i was terrified and i would start shaking so bad to the point of having a seizure from it my last spanking was at years old and thankfully after that incident spankings were infrequent and rare i cant even say i had a spanking at and only once at and no more after that are spankings really meant to be this bad is it abuse or is it normal and i am just being sensitive and had a sensitive reaction to as a kid i see all theses post about how people are happy they grew up with spankings and i just dont get how someone can say that,Positive

i wont bother with much detail because i have already gone through therapy and ive been out of contact with them for years i was going through my drive to find my resume to make updates and happened to see her new email address started with brokenheartedmother i emailed and called shortly after because as much as she was the reason i felt desperate enough to become a sex worker ive gotten out of that since and she convinced me my worth was so little that i stayed in another very abuse relationship for years without reaching out she was also the one that saved me from the same feeling when i was a pre teen sort of she did physically but i was then separated from the family for a year and was diagnosed mood nos in an american psych ward i still feel really bad i have to go to bed soon and i wouldnt want her to hurt herself and the email name is a huge red flag im assuming the worst i have no idea what is going on with her and im scared she doesnt live in town i dont have a car or her addressim trying to journal it out but i need some feedbackadvice im going to try to get more therapy tomorrow this is so confusing if anyone else has been through this sort of thing tell me what you did,Neutral

hi this is my second post here im asking for advice this time because im really at a loss im an adult who had to move back in with my abusive parents after being out on my own for a significant period of time its been such a degrading experience that i sometimes wonder if i wouldve been better off just being homeless ive been working a lot on trying to set boundaries in general i essentially had zero autonomy as a childteen and because of this i became a people pleaser who let everyone walk all over me like a doormat im done being that way its fucking exhausting the thing is its nigh impossible to set even simple boundaries with my parents they still treat me like a childteen if you read my last post it was about how they still try to ground me and take my things away when i pay the bill for it ex my phone and they refuse to accept that im an adult now recently i got a new job that pays a significantly better wage than what i was making before im so happy because this may finally be my chance to get back out from under their roof the thing is the onboarding process has been slow lots of training and then waiting for the state to approve my certificates etc for the past month or so my mother has been asking me five or six times a day every single day if ive heard anything from my job and im not even exaggerating its the same question five times a day seven days a week for the past month it drives me up the fucking wall my mother besides being extremely manipulative and sometimes physically violent is a very nosy person and will be absolutely relentless when it comes to getting any information she wants whether its her business or not its very much a habit for her to harp on me and my sibling who is also an adult and lives here about anything and everything because she claims nothing gets done if im not breathing down your neck its incredibly invasive and besides that its not even effective my temperament heavily aligns with symptoms of pathological demand avoidance which means her reminders and frequent questions have the opposite effect and only serve to cause me more anxiety and resentment ive tried to be very firm with her ive told her multiple times to stop asking me about my job and that ill tell her when i hear something so she doesnt need to ask she always responds with threats of violence and says that it doesnt matter how many times she asks me something if she asks me a question i am to answer it without argument or complaint lest i want to get beaten i know these are probably just empty threats because if she really wanted to beat me she would have already but shes beaten me before and i know for a fact she would do it again yesterday i told her again to stop asking me that this is a nonnegotiable boundary im standing on and if she continues to ask me from this point forward im just going to ignore her she said that im never allowed to ignore her for any reason and that if i do ignore her there will be consequences again threatening violence i know this is probably such a simple and trivial thing but it honestly wouldnt matter what boundary i was trying to set if i do anything at all that they dislike they threaten and harass me i just dont know what to do because when i do get out of this house im going nocontact with both of them and im terrified because i know theyd go to the ends of the earth to force me to stay in their lives ive dealt with harassment from nonfamily members before and unfortunately law enforcement was not helpful about it whatsoever so i have very little hope ill ever be able to cut contact with them at all,Positive
i was somewhat abused by my parents growing up and i think they both have anger issues and problems with lack of emotionempathy its gotten better in recent years but we still argue sometimes however on days like today sometimes my dad just snaps at me out of nowhere he yelled saying that i was being rude to him and had a bad temper wed been having a conversation for the past minutes and whilst i was a little frustrated having to explain something to him over and over again i was by no means being rude i go up to my room and was honestly triggered by him shouting it brought me back to when i was a kid within minutes he comes to my door pouting like a toddler and asks me what i want for dinner as a way of apologising without actually having to admit hes in the wrong he does this often and it pisses me off so much why do you have the right to treat me like shit then try to guilt me by acting like a child when youre years old it just make me feel so shit when he yells at me and has no empathy because im alone in this world and have no one else to comfort me or show me affection,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
throw away account female y so this has happened for a couple of years especially when i was a teenager i give her the benefit of the doubt because i was a shit teenager but i finally moved out at and went to university fast forward years i had a few things happened and i was going to become homeless during the time i was living away from my mum she kept asking and telling me to move back if everything wasnt okay and i finally did i had no home and i needed somewhere to live so after her telling me time and time again to move back with her to get back on my feet i did i have only been living here for a couple of months trying to find a job paying rent with the money i have saved up because i cant live here free but since moving back i keep getting told i never want you when you move out again stay out i wished i dropped you at a foster home after your dad passed away you never do anything here i cook and clean almost everyday i also get told about my physical appearance jeez you have gotten big you look fat in that you look homeless wear nicer clothes and i understand a mother should never say stuff like that to her children but she is my mum and i love her but recently its been more bad things than good things and i dont know what i need to do cause i cant really leave i need to stay here to earn money so i can move out again but i also cant leave the room when she is saying shit like that to me even though i have explained to her that i need to leave the room right now can we talk about this in mins and its also not just me that feels like this i have three other brothers that agree but i also believe she is worse with me because it a motherdaughter relationship and she never got along with her mum or even her sister,Neutral
i was in a relationship for years years in we had a daughter my partner and i were really disconnected and had large boundaries from both of our families for valid reasons ill touch on a bit later my ex partner year old and i lived together in our own house we rented until we split up after years went by and after having a child my partner cheated on me with a year old and walked away from us and the affair had gotten my ex daughters mom involved into a cult which drove her mad little to say i have full custody and my daughters mom and hasnt been around for years now needless to say im and im still building my career in life so i dont make crazy amount of money cant afford daycare rent and living costs a lone this had forced me to reach out to my abusive mother for a living arrangement only family i have who struggles with a narcissistic personality and suffers from borderline personality disorder and who had mentally abused me at a very young age i go through a tough breakup and i lose my inner family just to have to move into my controlling mothers home with my year old my mom has phases where she is a great person but also has weeks or days where she a horrible person almost like im not her son and my child isnt her granddaughter im sure this falls into having bpd im struggling mentally and i know my child needs me mentally present ive tried having serious convos with my mom about my mental health and our relationship possibly having counseling to improve our relationship but she takes it as a jokebullies and only blames me my mom watches my year old while im at work i do pay her but she doesnt seem very attentive to her meaning my mom will sit on her phone while my child will self entertain the moment i get home from work my mom kicks up her feet and she no longer helps me with anything which i can understand because she isnt her parent and she isnt obligated too i work hvac construction so im fairly tired when i get home in a f attic most of the time my mom doesnt abide by any of my parenting rules so naturally my child looks at me like im bad cop and even calls me mean from time to time and has grandma syndrome i feel like im losing my patience way more and its hard to focus on my day to day life due to these distractions i have no idea what to do besides when my daughter turns this fall get her enrolled in school and find an apartment and cut my mother off any suggestions,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my mom has always been abusive to me ever since i remember existing she would hit me or scream at me for the smallest stuff she never played with me as a kid she was in a bad mood so i could never even have a normal conversation with her i got used to it quickly she would beat me in public and if i cried she would force me to stop we moved to america a couple years ago and im almost now she is still very mentally abusive but she stopped hitting me shes never sorry for hurting me she never admits that shes wrong and whenever she hurts me i start crying and screaming because i just want this nightmare to end and whenever i start screaming she says that im disrespecting her she mocks me when i cry she tells me to stop crying she threatens to send me back to the country we came from and she knows that i love it here and that if we go back i will literally lose everything and just kill myself but she doesnt care she blames everything on me she keeps saying hurtful things and expects me not to cry i cant even tell anyone from my family because they will tell her that i talked to them about it and she will get even more mad i just want this to end and she keeps saying that she regrets taking me to america with her because i make her life harder i want her to respect my feelings i want everything to be fine i want a normal happy family like all of my friends have i want to be able to come home from school without being scared of whats going to happen to me i want to run away i cant do this anymore i know that this will never end no matter how much she apologizes no matter how much i tell her that she hurts me she just doesnt give a shit im on the verge of killing myself the only thing thats keeping me alive is my girlfriend but this is not helping me anymore either,Positive
its just so sad seeing my mom like that like seeing an animal stuck in a trap they dont understand how they got there and why they cant get out of it i know shes alone because of her actions toward pretty much every person she ever knew i finally accepted she would never change no matter how hard i tried i just cant help but feel guilty because it was supposed to be my job to take care of her,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
for context i am transmasc and live with her i have had problems with my mother for a while now and my boyfriend has been saying what im telling him about my mom sounds like abuse she almost never hits me so it didnt cross my mind at first but its getting worse and im terrified of her to the point of panic attacks when i think about standing up to her she had always been a loving mom in my opinion but when i turned around things began going downwards with our relationship recently i had wanted to go up to my room with my partner and watch a movie she was not ok with this which is understandable but i had offered for my yo sister to come and watch it with us and promised the door would remain open and no innapropriate things would happen my mother is very against me having almost any physical contact with my boyfriend which includes cuddling even right in front of her with just his arm around me my boyfriend decided to try and talk to my mother about how she treats him as if he only thinks aboutwants sex from our relationship hes on the asexual spectrum and he felt disrespected so mentioned that he didnt feel very respected at all and my mother yelled at him and kicked him out demanding respect afterwards i wanted to talk to her so we sat on opposite sides of my door and i told her how i felt about her i told her that i just wanted love from my partner and that not everything leads to sex and she needs to learn that she responded by yelling at me through the door then i told her im done with the conversation and asked her to leave to which she slammed my door open and began screaming at me that im so disrespectful and that the world revolves around me and how im selfish and i must think shes stupid for saying that i dont just want sex from my boyfriend i was afraid she was going to hit me she didnt and i backed away into the wall she continued screaming at me and cussing me out while i slumped to the floor crying and saying im scared she told me to get the fuck downstairs and that she was going to call my dad i told her i need to be alone and she thought i was going to try and kill or hurt myself i told her i wouldnt and she yelled to keep my door open and that im so damn selfish i got the nerve to ask her why she was like this and she just scoffed at me and mimicked the question back to me then left there have been more situations very similar to this where she did hit me not hard and usually just my hand or arm and im beginning to think she might not be the hero of a mom i though she was she has threatend me previously with my comforts music my bf my stuffies ect and has sometimes not let me eat she goes out almost every weekend to drink and get fucked coming home either really late or the next day leaving me to babysit my younger siblings and yos then i have to take care of her while shes hung over i make breakfast lunch i bring her everything she needs while she sleeps all day yesterday she had a breakdown in my arms sobbing and sniffling i had just been crying and she knew that but still expected comfort from me she has a good reason to be sad her bestfriends death was a year ago yesterday but shes been making me take care of my sibling so often they feel like my own kids my sister feels a similar way about our mother idk if this is enough info but please give me your opinions and advice,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

first of all my parents are more neglectful than abusive and i dont know if this is the correct place to ask since i dont know a lot about subreddits my apologies if this doesnt belong here so around january this year i found a kitten it is a female and we already have a male cat with us my parents loved the kitten and pretended there was no way to find her another household so we kept her the problem is my parents are against sterilisation on animals also my male cat is completely emaciated since he fights with a ton of other cats for females in my town since i found this kitten my siblings and i have been trying to convince my parent to sterilise the female cat since we think itll be awful for her and us to be having kittens every once in a while its not the first time we are in this kind of situation and what they do is wait for the kittens to be old enough to be with another family so right now both of the cats are trying to mate is there any way i can convince my parents to sterilise at least one of the cats i cant get in too much trouble with them since they are pretty toxic and cant discuss things properly there was already a time my father and i had a heated argument about not mating my dog with his coworkers dog and i cant take her to the vet myself since i dont have any money,Neutral

hi i came on here to ask if this was just a punishment or like physical abuse so from when i was my current age my father has punished me and my sister by staying in pushup position for hours when we would act out or do something to make him mad he would yell at us while he forced us to stay in pushup position as we cried and pleaded to stop if we got out of push up position he would slam things against walls to make noise and scare us into doing what he wanted i recently asked my sister what she remembers about her childhood before i was born and she mentioned how my dad used to hit her to me this seems very possible given how often we were scared shitless that he would hit us and the form of punishment he uses if only one of us me or my sister were in trouble he would punish us the same way expect he would make us watch the other one in pain i rember one time when i was around ten he made us do pushup position in the middle of an ace hardware store and yelled at us about embarrassing we are anyways is this abuse or just punishment,Neutral

hi all i have been talking with my therapist about this a lot recently and she suggested i reach out to a group of people who might better understand what im going through so here i am not really looking for advice as i know what to do in these situations now just trying to get a little frustration off my chest some background about me and my family to preface my parents have always been authoritative in their parenting style very akin to how my grandparents raised them theyre very rarely physically abusive but beatings have never been totally out of the question even as ive emerged into adulthood i frequently get told i can still whoop your ass mostly as a scare tactic but i have no doubt they would still do so if they felt inclined they are both extremely manipulative in many different ways verbally and psychologically abusive i have been guilt tripped gaslit threatened and more all my life i know not all narcissists are abusive by default and i dont want to paint all of them in a bad light but i would be lying if i said narcissistic abuse isnt a real thing that ive been subject to my entire life both my parents are incredibly entitled but especially my dad who very much has grandiosity a lack of empathy and exhibits exploitive behavior among other things when i was almost i got a stable and wellpaying job that allowed me to move out on my own i signed a year lease on a shitty cheap apartment because i was desperate to get out from under my parents roof it was the best year of my life and full of so much discovery and healing i was living paychecktopaycheck and despite rent taking up more than half of my income most months i was just happy to finally be on my own when my year lease was up i had to move back into my parents house my landlord was going to raise my rent by over if i were to renew my lease and i just couldnt afford it i essentially had two options move back in with my parents or be homeless reluctantly i chose the former knowing it would only be temporary and at the very least i would have my own room and a warm bed to sleep in soon after i moved in with my parents i got laid off from my job it was a huge setback i quickly found another job but it only paid about half as much i went from making hr to hr despite this i did not have to pay rent sort of my parents force me to pay them a month to contribute to the mortgage payment and was completely financially independent when it came to all my other expenses phone bill car insurance car payment credit card gas food you name it i paid for it myself the only thing my parents helped me out with was health insurance because im chronically ill and sometimes the meds i need can be very expensive despite being almost completely independent financially and having paid out of pocket myself to own the majority of my possessions my parents still frequently threaten to take these things away if they dislike how i behave their reasoning being that your things are in my house and i pay the mortgage therefore your possessions actually belong to me which isnt even true since they make me contribute to the mortgage payments anyways for instance i got into an argument with my father last december wherein he took away my phone my laptop and my car keys i am almost years old the title of the car and the phone line are in my name and i exclusively pay for them i had to call out of work for two days and explain to my supervisor that my dad had stolen my car keys and wouldnt give them back so i wasnt able to drive to and from work it was very embarrassing and humiliating to have to explain that as an adult i had essentially been grounded in hindsight i should have called the cops as soon as it happened i have verifiable proof that all of the things he grounded me from belong to me im not sure why i didnt but i know now that if something like that ever happens again thats the action i can take they have not taken any more of my possessions since then but they still frequently threaten to do so i have told them multiple times that i am an adult and they can no longer ground me as if i were a teenager especially when i pay to have these things but they dont care ive started keeping a log with dates and times of every time they threaten to take my things just in case i need it i have a paper copy of my cars title and proof of my phone bill payments hidden away so if the time ever comes where i do need to take action against them i will have everything i need to prove my case and i had an extra hidden set of car keys made in the event that the original ones are taken i dont really know what else to say other than that i just feel stuck here i guess im so fed up with my boundaries being blatantly disrespected every single day even though ive worked so incredibly hard to be assertive about them if youve ever experienced anything like this and youre comfortable sharing please let me know i know i cant be the only one if you made it to the end thank you for reading this far,Positive

my mom has been abusive for as long as i can remember one of my earliest memories was being thrown against the wall by my hair as a toddler she used excessive force to punish me often times i was just exhibiting the normal developmental behavior that comes with each age group in middle school i had head lice for years straight and she often made me cry i didnt know why mom was so mean she would use threats to kill me to keep me in line often getting into my face pointing her finger screaming as a teenager whenever i spoke out against how she treated me or did anything she didnt like she would hit me it became a daily thing for her to hit meso much that when i drove w her as an adult i flinched when she made a rapid movement she once slapped my face and strangled me my mom distorts truth and one time as a teen when she was going to attack me i was literally begging for her not to hit me please mom dont stop i was in a sitting position on the couch and as she lunged at me i pushed her off of me with my feet i got in sever trouble with this wait until i get your dad you little bitch more violence from him to this day she tells people i kicked her in the stomach im emotional now even thinking about this my mental health hasnt been good as an adult my closest family members never got me into treatment when i tried to kill myself as a teen and young adult it escalated and led to some really difficult timesinstability i always sought counseling and have even been in programs but i actually needed acute care no one intervened as i struggled and my mental health deteriorated to point where i was hearing voicesextremely paranoid struggling with alcohol addiction and was in v unsafe environments that led to more undue trauma the only person who did assist of any sort was my mother god bless its just really hard because she was and still is emotionally abusive i think now she knows she cant assault me anymore but she still yells at me calls me names and gaslights me daily any attempts at discussing this are futile and usually leads to further screams regardless of how i approach the topic she has said that she apologizes for how she was when i was younger and shes trying to be a better person i just dont see the work shes doing again the only saving grace between us is that she has helped me when i needed picking up after some pretty hard falls her love language is acts of service and i know she loves me thanks if you made it this far im back to living with her and am seeking ways to get out again its only been months but ive had suicidal ideations and have driven myself mad with how much im gaslighted questioning whats real she wants me to go out to eat with her on mothers day but i told her im busy it just takes so much out of me to hang out with her agree with her lies and pretend that i like her im feeling bad about this am curious what your thoughts are and how you think i should proceed thanks,Positive
if youre being assaulted by abusive parents dont call the police they likely wont do anything they might even take your parents side and try to admit you to a psych hospital out of nowhere the cops are notorious for not doing anything during domestic incidents and studies have shown that many of them are also domestic abusers theyre notorious for not reporting to child protective services when theyre supposed to be mandated reporters call cps cps is a different entity and they are in charge of investigating child abuse i spent my entire childhood calling the cops and they did nothing i wish i had known to call cps instead,Neutral
i love me mom and dad but my dad is a big sarcastic being not a human at all what must i do i cant help such dads at all he mocks me in public regarding my mobile addiction and i cant help it and i dont know what to even do about this i wish i was never born in this country and all children deserve parents but all parents dont deserve children why did they decide to have me they would have adopted a child still i am pissed off guys we were in a crowded place when he mocked me by calling me a kid who lost his virginity through the phone even in a luxury hotel he mocked me i got really angry what can i do guys please help me to decide what to do please give me a suggestion what i can do in these circumstances,Neutral
as i talked to my childhood friend and my new friend and we all three have in common that we have abusive mothers we had to cut contact with i wondered if there was a sub for abusive parents and so i found my way in here i realized knowing this sub exists with thousands of people who has similar experiences as us helps me feel that im not alone and theres a safety in that it cant be denied or gaslighted away as easy when im reminded that theres others with mothers or fathers who are abusive i think its healing to be a part of this sub my mom was the last one i wanted to admit was abusive i shared all other traumas but the part about her i kept locked away in a secret box until i was around i dont know why it was so hard to admit she wasnt who i made her up to be maybe because it would feel like my whole childhood was a lie a shitty hurtful lie and i would lose my parent the core parent figure attached to my identity my whole life i tried to be the daughter that would make my mom love me and be normal to me i assumed i needed to help her but it was pointless she didnt let me near her and she hated therapists to this day i have still never heard her say what happened to her that made her this way all i remember is her saying why should i share my secrets to anyone thats my business and that was it seeing her happy smiling and present was like discovering a rare new bird in the sky of my memories of her shes mad or distant i dreamt about her as an alive doll several times she is alive yet not thats my image of her and it creeps me out to this day still,Positive
my dad has been contacting me lately saed me physically abused my mom a lot growing up i was naive and didnt tell the authorities earlier and went along with how my mom handled things my mom is now elderly out of it mentally and checked out and she was ashamed and wanted to stay hidden about it i see now he likes to target down on their luck women or women with something to lose like their job as a nurse for instance he enjoys making women feel bad shaming them and asserting his sense of dominance and winning my dad wants my naive moms nursing pension and made it clear he felt he deserved it having been married to her since he feels women do this to men therefore he thinks he deserves it and he takes no blame for abusing her badly many times and hes trying to use my brother to get to my mom and access what he feels should have been his since she divorced him since mothers day is coming up and he knew i was going to visit i think is why he called me privately yesterday to stress me out he made sure to insult me belittle me slut shame me etc of course never taking responsibility for bad things hes done and blaming how im just like my mom whom he loathes he hates my mom and blames her for everything in his life and takes it out on me whenever possible my dad has been a predator to women for years now he owns a home in california and rents out rooms usually to women that are struggling then he will manipulate them gaslight them and try to do whatever he can to them he also goes on dating sites and tries to find women to become his sugar mama in addition to using his cute sweet dog and his business to gain credibility and access to women recently he sent me an unsolicited obviously nude photo in his yard casually acting like its a joke hes always been allowed to say and do whatever he pleases and use fear and shame to control others i randomly thought to look at his business yelp and google and saw he has almost all good professional construction job reviews also i want him to be known as a predator but i dont necessarily want to put my name on it as he will attack me and he lives close to my mother so it can be a risk i live about hours away but i can see him just trying to get me somehow anyone have any experience with this,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

posting this here because i cant find my normal abusive parents subreddit i guess im too messed up to remember the name so if you see this post twice i apologize i dont know why i still try with my mom it hurts so bad every time i feel like i get so close to a working relationship with her and always every time she does something or says something that is so cruel and unfeeling that i question why i ever tried to mend the relationship in the first place take minutes ago i am in town for my grandmothers funeral normally i am very far from their southern american town and i limit communication to only a few texts per week if that i usually stop texting when the protrump conspiracies or proisrael rants come out btw all palestinians are basically hamas did you know because i didnt lol its nuts oh and the students protesting at columbia university i live in nyc they are antisemites determined to not let jewish students get into any buildings its nutsi know several people currently protesting im in the protest chats on lex its confirmed that about a rd of those protesters are members of the jewish student union fyi so theyre kind of nuts i have been conditioned to look past this anyways minutes ago i put on s music while i made dinner with my mom so i could drown out some depression thoughts ive been having whilst here i have been pretty emotionally shut down for the past days of being here so as to not let myself get hurt i feel like a zombie every time i have to be around them the thoughts come back anyways the s music always puts my mom in a good mood and has her dancing so i think maybe since shes in a good mood maybe i can talk about setting a boundary with her to set up the boundary i am a skilled singer i have been since i was and since i was my parents really enjoyed showponying me having me sing for their friends and strangers wherever we went at every party restaurants gatherings you name it they were so proud of me and they want to show off those voice lessons that they paid for obviously when i entered my incredibly emotional puberty era it became all too much i begged them to stop i would get so embarrassed when they asked me to sing that i would have to find a bathroom and cry and hide for hours i would tell them i couldnt handle it right now i was going through a lot friends bullying me horrible menses a fun little eating disorder youre being selfish we paid for those voice lessons you better show them off that was painful to hear its still painful to hear till this day because my mother will never drop it im now and she cant let it go btw this is a small event out of hundreds of larger more hurtful events physically hurtful events so were singing well im fake singing and she knows it im just trying to show that i am enjoying the moment so she doesnt make a comment like if youre going to be so depressed around us then why come at all she starts trying some high notes and asks me to teach her i freeze up that emotional ptsd hitting me in the damn face i really want to hide in the hallway bathroom i try to work through it and teach her she says show me and i ignore it no more singing from me we finish dinner eat with my dad and all are still in a relatively good mood thank god my dad and i are talking while my mom is distracted and i actually think we had a constructive conversation where i set a real unrelatedboundary my dad is a much better listener than my mom so ive built up some confidence my mom is singing a little while playing her phone game i am cleaning up the table and i tell her you know i would love to sing with you if you werent weird about it i actually love to sing bad choice of words mom what when have i ever been weird about you singing me do you know what showponying is btw i have defined showpony for her about once a year to be fair its not commonly used in this way unless youre an improviser the real phrase that i want to say is that she pimps me out but she would be very distracted by the use of the curse word pimp mom no did you make that word up me well its when you ask someone to do something like sing for others just for your own enjoyment without caring whether the singer wants to or not mom oh my gosh stop when have i ever done that to you me yesterday at a family gathering the day beforea different but similar family gathering and also the day before thatwhen i was trying to practice privately for a song i was singing at my grandmothers funeral i really dont like it and it hurts my feelings if you promised to stop i would sing with you whenever you want id be happy to mom shuts down at this suggestion i do not do that to you ever of course you can turn any conversation negative im done talking leave me alone so i can play my game im tired and i dont want to deal with that nonsense right now i want to push back so bad i know its hopeless me well im just trying to set a boundary with you so we can have a better relationship mom just stop i cant handle your negativity me well im sorry but actually you were the one who made it negative i was just trying to solve a problem she walks away im so messed up now im a year old grown ass woman and i am on the floor of our hallway bathroom just bawling my eyes out why do i try why do i think things will change because i have hope that i can one day have a relationship with them im so jealous of my best friend who tells her mom everything i just wish i had that its stupid and i know i have to stop but i also know that im addicted to trying at this point is anyone else here still trying can anyone relate or is it just too foolish,Positive

cuz like i get calling ur kid a bitch unwarranted is bad but if i am being a bitch or worthless or a disgrace and i know my mom will call me those things then at that point its on me right i lowkey deserve it at that point also is it abuse to say you deserve to be beat if she said it only once or when i expressed suicidal thoughts once she told me to get on with it other than these things my mom is fine considering the pain she herself goes through with scoliosis like maybe im a bad daughter she always tells me i dont do anything around the house and i tell her to give me a list of chores because she never has and she tells me to offer to do chores but when i do she says nobut then she says i never offer sorry im rambling now my point is is she abusive at all or is it my fault,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

im honestly shocked so my mom and dad have been arguing again nothing new they used to be a lot worse and i would always involve myself i would always try to come to the rescue for my mom and she would always tell me not to involve myself i used to absolutely hate my dad and my mom would tell me he is still your dad i would basically fight my moms battles and for years i have always tried to be the peacemaker or the mediator i am also the eldest by the way however i realized it was truly never my battle to fight i am just their child and they are the adults who should know better so recently my mom has developed a pattern whenever her and my dad are on bad terms suddenly my siblings and i are the worst people on earth too she randomly started talking about how she is treated so badly and that others being me and my siblings see and do nothing she said and they are just as guilty you are actually an accomplice i was so shocked how can you call your child an accomplice in something they have no control over and also keeping in mind that she was the same person who said we shouldnt pick sides and that my dad is still my dad it seems that she doesnt like my relationship with my dad she always tries to make me feel guilty over things that have nothing to do with mei have no control over,Neutral

trigger warning so i just moved out of college there has been many fights between me and my parents about move out i kept asking for months hey how are we going to move out and then they just ignored me they also kept telling me they would figure it out i even tried to plan out a really good way to move out and i already had everything in motion but they called and cancelled all of it fast forward until two days until move out and they send me a condescending text saying that because of my poor planing i need to sell all my stuff and get rid of my pet to move out i of course told them there was no damn way i would eve do that and reminded them that i kept telling them we needed to plan for move out they just kept insisting that i have to get rid of my pet for context behind this next but my dad was involved in a really bad divorce between him and his ex wife during that he quite literally through me in the middle and let his ex steal my identity and cancel all financial aid i had and ruin my credit score he also let his ex take everything i had and hold it for ransom i know this probably sounds overdramatic but when i say i have nothing i have nothing i told him that my pet was the one thing i had left on this planet then one thing that cared for me this went on back and forth for a while until he sent me a final text in it he basically explained that ive always been a burden to him and that i have never sacrificed anything for him he said i was extremely selfish and he would move me out this summer but the would not be taking me for any breaks over next school year he also said he would be taking my pet and would not let me have it back over the fall he then blocked me today when my mom picked me up it was a even bigger shit show she kept implying she may not show up and that she was well within her rights to not show up she kept texting me demanding i apologize or else shell leave me homeless causing me to get really stressed and to selfh again to try and dull out the stress and pain from the situation i told her that i tried to plan something out before but they canceled that plan i also tried to call my grandmother for help and she just told me i should be more considerate of my moms feelings and that once again ive never had to loose anything before she also knows i lost everything to my dads ex my mom then threw in a bunch of threats and told me to be prepared to jump in the car and leave as fast as possible which i was fine with when she arrived she shut off the ac and told me i didnt get those privileges any more she then rolled down all the back windows where i was sitting and turned the radio to its highest setting playing the loudest songs possible keep in mind this wasnt a short drive so for hours on the interstate we drove with windows down and radios blasting i tried to nap and i kid you not she swerved the car near a ditch and turned around when i shot up and said you do not get to sleep because you made me drive all the way out here i know if i tried to go back to sleep or talk back she would actually drive us into that ditch im worried being back at the house its going to be an all out crap show im always a scape goat and i know that they will find every little thing to blame me for i also suffer from pretty bad depression and im worried it may drive me into doing something not good its already caused me to heavily think about it i know the wise thing to do is to not stay and leave the house but i have no friends or other family if i leave i will be homeless with no money to my name after the court case i just dont know what to do and i really dont think i can survive the whole summer if this is already where we are at,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hello everyone ill l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of whats up i just need peoples views on wether this is normal or not or not that bad or fucked up or whatever but i need either the dismissal for this not being that bad or validation so i dont feel guilty for how i feel its also weirdly empowering instead of victimizing when i acknowledge that the things im going to describe speak poorly of them and that i can see that i dont feel like bringing this up to my friends before laying it out id like to get another thing off my chest i feel like im misleading you because im not mentioning much of the stuff i did wrong but i never put my family in danger nothing close to that that is the only reason for hitting someone that i could justify but i was still made to feel like the things i did where very bad also feeling guilty because its not the typical abusive household where im getting punished for no reason its a loving place im aso conflicted because this person has a reputation as a very dependable friend and also he is not egotistical but idk still this doesnt sit right with me im family is from eastern europe sovietish culture immigrated to argentina in thats when i was born my life up until yo i dont remember anything basically so all of this is what ive been told father lied a lot and was hysterical when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes my mother always put me in another room so i wouldnt witness that when i was i was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out dad wanted me to stop i didnt so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door at some point during this period up until yo he said that i should fear him like an animal he never laid a hand on me but had outbursts when im mom divorces him so after that ive always lived with my mom grandparents and uncle all maternal up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place visits weekly dad left the country years later when i was and before that hed pick me up times a year im told i wasnt really sad when he left btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me musicians are evil freemasons the number everywhere that kinda thing once at like yo in the shower i broke down and called my mom to talk because i couldnt handle all the badmouthing that my father was talking about them my family i went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when i was and luckily snapped out of it so after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure which i guess was even more so when my actual father left the country from this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which i feel have conditioned me ill share a few representative examples we were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking i told him to shut up in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheekmouth from his part this was some months later im sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks uncle comes in says we are eating soon so dont eat any more chocolate when he came back to call me to dinner he sees i ate all the chocolate takes the water bottle and empties it on my head it was at keast half full because i remember even the matress soaking on the part i was sitting he told me to stay there so i couldnt change and even had to sleep on that matress idk how this would make you feel but for me its a good example of the humiliation anger shame and whatnot that i felt with some frequency from his actions given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me i always felt intimidated afraid so i didnt express those emotions and swallowed them all repressing at most id cry silently for a bit or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror silently of course for a moment and stopped it so this is an example thats easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating angering etc he would do something like that once a month or twice a week depending on my behavior times it was something small unlike the example i gave which is obvious to anyone but those small things would also fill me with tears shame and whatever and like i said there was a frequency to it maybe it was misbehavior at school or half assing some chore and hed say something sometimes normally sometimes not so much so something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably small for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation this continued until i was around wed still laugh play fight and those things the negative situations were a small portion of the time we spent together but the influence of his skewed methods was evident i was violent with my friends at school like id twist their arm so they would admit im right or something or making them flinch i was never a bully mind you all of this was normal playing for me i would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything once i was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foottoed it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part no notable reaction from his part just disbelief as in whats wrong with you when i was i lied big time for the first time ever i skipped class and didnt give my parents the schools note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol and when found out i was grounded like this i could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday where i was so happy for them to finally smile at me for this family lying is a big thing in case you havent noticed its a joking comment but also serious they were very big on me telling the truth i fail high school like three or four times i just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food drinking coca cola etc when i was i guess studying for a subject i had to pass to pass the year my parents mon and uncle wanted to make sure i studied so he controlled the process i went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone after hours uncle comes in and starts testing what i should have studied i dont answer im getting very anxious like i am now just typing this out in my belly which always happened when i knew he would get angry after finding out about something i did wrong and he understood what i had been doing so he takes my phone puts it on the floor grabs a thermos i had laying around and holds it above my phone looking at me and asking me what was i really doing he was barely containing his temper his nostrils were flaring i swore i just couldnt study or concentrate so hed spare the phone something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like hed drop it some years later id be again failing the year so i had to pass on the subjects i owed to make it simple there was an option where i could choose between a hard exam and an easy one he said i should do the hard one of course i agreed but later i took the easy one we were in my room when he found out he went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg where it hits a nerve or smt he came up to my face and i instinctively covered my belly he saw this and told me i shouldnt protect myself from him that this was all due to my decisions or whatever not long after that i guess i failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because i was driving my mom crazy which is partially true btw i was really stressing her out i was lying to her every year telling her i was studying and that i was passing my exams around this time i was hanging out at a friends place and some movement he did made me flinch something that had never happened with him it wasnt even a sudden motion haha i felt so anxious and ashamed god at some point he was done with me after i once more showed no cooperation with his help literally he said hed be there for whats needed like hes not pretending i dont exist but like our friendly relationship was over basically for lying eventually i apologized and we had a long conversation what he said boiled down to ill really try but itll be hard to rebuild trust you cant mess up you understand this time there will be no coming back from that one mind you this was a very serene reasonable conversation we were very calm and mature btw this happened one or two more times like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and i were in the same room cuz wed barely talk and if i asked smt indirectly to him hed be short disinterested or didnt say anything anyway im now he hasnt put a hand on me since that last time i mentioned of course still an intimidating man strong control issues constantly needs to prove to you that he is right very irritable oh and some months ago i brought up the subject mentioning how i dont know how it would turn this time out if he were to hit me now that im he said calmly im still capable of turning you into a handicapped person now a disclaimer while on the emotional level theres tons of fear resentment and anger towards him cognitively i know where he was coming from im not saying it was right im saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow the subconscious repressed emotions or whatever term its not that they dont know the importance of working on this and letting these things out they dont even think theres anything wrong ive brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle he just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem to put it succinctly no apology my mom wasnt very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didnt see the emotional damage he thinks he had to do it but i know that in reality he was and is carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization you were driving your mom mad you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time etc im actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing lol i was also told to basically stop victimizing myself he is like this but since he doesnt go around flipping out on everybody nor did he do anything to me unjustified he was never stopped i believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate so as i said on the mental aspect i know theres no point in looking for guilty ones but emotionally i want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself when i dont distract myself with the phone or any activity some emotions come to attention i may even cry for a second this makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which i only have to let work by unclenching muscles releasing mental tension just relaxing and letting myself feel everything ive supressed for so long i feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe thats buried even deeper also im anxious about the moment i let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me like i cant make something up and but also the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible or theyd just assume i was projecting the trauma from my biological father on my uncle lol sad but ill just let go at some point and thats it ive stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family its not wise to need their understanding even if its family ive come to realize that my social anxiety awkwardness emotional coldness towards family i cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion gosh my grandma is severely ill and i struggle to be compassion like i know its there somewhere i can feel it sometimes but theres so much repressed bs covering it up irritability towards family and many other things are a result of this this is good news for me because i now know its not just random but a result of the minds shadow,Positive

im currently a f the oldest daughter of the household has a younger brother that is currently in high school and i have a rather difficult and unstable relationship with my mother however even though our relationship has been toxic for as long as i can remember that doesnt stop me from wanting to have a good relationship with her there was a time where two years ago i wanted to cut off all contact and go no contact because i figured that was the best for me at the time but flash forward to now i realized that i felt guilty for wanting to go no contact and am now trying to repair the broken relationship im not sure whether its my inner child talking or the oldest sibling trauma bond that ties me close to her or if deep down i really truly want to have a relationship with her just to give some background information both my parents are in a loveless marriage but refuses to divorce and currently still lives in the same household i am no longer living with them but i still live rather close i would say my current relationship with my mom is a little better than the relationship i had with her when i still lived at home i would say it was more so physically abusive where she would throw silverware at me hit me and there was no sense of privacy at home since i am now no longer financially bound to her she cant do those things however that doesnt stop her being very emotionally abusive and mentally very draining she tends to be very jealous of my happiness in terms of wanting to hang out with my friends constantly projects her insecurities onto me since shes not in a happy marriage she tells me not to waste time on building romantic relationships or that friends doesnt matter as much as her since she does not have friends when i communicate to her that i want to be there emotionally for a friend or wants to spend time with a friend she questions why i am wasting my life and how no one will stay in my life forever and this leads me down into a downward spiral of anxiety believing no one will stay with me or put up with me because she drills the mindset that no one will want to put up with me that if i am a horrible daughter why would anyone else want me keep in mind i have always been a reasonable daughter i have always passed all my classes did well in school took care of my brother cooked for the family when my mom would go on vacation i was there emotionally for my mom when she wanted to talk was never judgemental and always tried my best to see her however her nagging and persistent guilt tripping never ceases she always picks at my appearance my weight claims that im a failure for not making enough that i am not focusing on myself enough theres so much more but on to the topic of this post just recently i was cleebrating my best friends birthday and was out at around pm for a painting session i was not on my phone but then took it out after i painted my mural and came to missed calls from my mom back to back i immediately got on the phone with her and told her where i was but she proceeded to guilt me for wasting time and claimed that i see my best friend more than i see her keep in mind that i try to see my mom as much as i can on average i see my mom at least three times a month she told me that all i do was waste time and then hung up on me when i was trying to explain myself that caused my mood to steadily shift and i wasnt able to enjoy myself she then proceeds to text me quite like sending texts exclaiming that i was still a child for not getting why she was calling so much when i was trying to explain to her that she was making me feel uncomfortable and that i was trying to enjoy my night without her guilting that led to her calling me immature and proceeds to not listen to me by that time i was fed up and then left the birthday celebration early because i felt too guilty for staying longer it just sucks because i feel like there are times my mom and i can seldom get along and have a good time but it just never lasts when i do have a good time with her it makes me disassociate and lowkey convinces me that none of it is real that she is only nice to get something from me that even if she is nice i can never fully be myself without feeling judged i do not feel comfortable with confiding in her about anything because her first response is always to judge me for my mistakes and never to comfort or guide me she is a ball of negativity and i can never feel truly at ease she can be very volatile with her words and actions and it is hard for me to predict what she will do next today i thought about doing therapy for the first time especially to bring her along with me for the journey i decided to research some therapists within our insurance network and thought to myself how she would take my idea so i decided to message her and ask whether she was willing to do therapy to fiximprove our relationship since she has told me various times when she was in a good mood that she wants to be closer to me she responds with what in a very judgemental way and i proceeded to explain to her that i think it would be good for our relationship and for both of us individually to be able to emotionally connect and bond and she has not responded to me it has been a full day and it is abnormal for her to not respond usually when she is like this she does not agree with my ideas and refuses to communicate im not sure if it is even worth for me to try to convince her that therapy can be a good idea if that was her initial reaction i feel as if my whole life i have to beg her or reason with her a thousand times to get her to see from my perspective she is an extremely stubborn selfish woman with possibly undiagnosed narcissism and im not sure if i should even try im very mentally drained to the point of giving up and not even trying anymore on our relationship because it just feels like nothing is changing any kind of thoughts or commentary would help i would really appreciate it,Positive
long post im writing this to vent for acknowledgment and to possibly ask some questions but mainly for venting because i feel so alone regarding this ill l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of whats up im family is from eastern europe sovietish culture immigrated to argentina in thats when i was born my life up until yo i dont remember anything basically so all of this is what ive been told father lied a lot and was hysterical when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes my mother always put me in another room so i wouldnt witness that when i was i was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out dad wanted me to stop i didnt so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door at some point during this period up until yo he said that i should fear him like an animal he never laid a hand on me but had outbursts when im mom divorces him so after that ive always lived with my mom grandparents and uncle all maternal up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place visits weekly dad left the country years later when i was and before that hed pick me up times a year im told i wasnt really sad when he left btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me musicians are evil freemasons the number everywhere that kinda thing once at like yo in the shower i broke down and called my mom to talk because i couldnt handle all the badmouthing that my father was talking about them my family i went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when i was and luckily snapped out of it so after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure which i guess was even more so when my actual father left the country from this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which i feel have conditioned me ill share a few representative examples we were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking i told him to shut up in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheekmouth from his part this was some months later im sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks uncle comes in says we are eating soon so dont eat any more chocolate when he came back to call me to dinner he sees i ate all the chocolate takes the water bottle and empties it on my head it was at keast half full because i remember even the matress soaking on the part i was sitting he told me to stay there so i couldnt change and even had to sleep on that matress idk how this would make you feel but for me its a good example of the humiliation anger shame and whatnot that i felt with some frequency from his actions given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me i always felt intimidated afraid so i didnt express those emotions and swallowed them all repressing at most id cry silently for a bit or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror silently of course for a moment and stopped it so this is an example thats easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating angering etc he would do something like that once a month or twice a week depending on my behavior times it was something small unlike the example i gave which is obvious to anyone but those small things would also fill me with tears shame and whatever and like i said there was a frequency to it maybe it was misbehavior at school or half assing some chore and hed say something sometimes normally sometimes not so much so something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably small for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation this continued until i was around wed still laugh play fight and those things but it was clear the influence of his skewed methods i was violent with my friends at school like id twist their arm so they would admit im right or something or making them flinch i was never a bully mind you all of this was normal playing for me i would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything once i was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foottoed it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part no notable reaction from his part just disbelief as in whats wrong with you when i was i lied big time for the first time ever i skipped class and didnt give my parents the schools note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol and when found out i was grounded like this i could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday where i was so happy for them to finally smile at me for this family lying is a big thing in case you havent noticed its a joking comment but also serious they were very big on me telling the truth i fail high school like three or four times i just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food drinking coca cola etc when i was i guess studying for a subject i had to pass to pass the year my parents mon and uncle wanted to make sure i studied so he controlled the process i went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone after hours uncle comes in and starts testing what i should have studied i dont answer im getting very anxious like i am now just typing this out in my belly which always happened when i knew he would get angry after finding out about something i did wrong and he understood what i had been doing so he takes my phone puts it on the floor grabs a thermos i had laying around and holds it above my phone looking at me and asking me what was i really doing he was barely containing his temper his nostrils were flaring i swore i just couldnt study or concentrate so hed spare the phone something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like hed drop it some years later id be again failing the year so i had to pass on the subjects i owed to make it simple there was an option where i could choose between a hard exam and an easy one he said i should do the hard one of course i agreed but later i took the easy one we were in my room when he found out he went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg where it hits a nerve or smt he came up to my face and i instinctively covered my belly he saw this and told me i shouldnt protect myself from him that this was all due to my decisions or whatever not long after that i guess i failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because i was driving my mom crazy which is true btw i was really stressing her out at some point he was done with me after i once more showed no cooperation with his help literally he said hed be there for whats needed like hes not pretending i dont exist but like our friendly relationship was over basically for lying eventually i apologized and we had a long conversation what he said boiled down to ill really try but itll be hard to rebuild trust you cant mess up you understand this time there will be no coming back from that one mind you this was a very serene reasonable conversation we were very calm and mature btw this happened one or two more times like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and i were in the same room cuz wed barely talk and if i asked smt indirectly to him hed be short disinterested or didnt say anything anyway im now he hasnt put a hand on me since that last time i mentioned of course still an intimidating man strong control issues constantly needs to prove to you that he is right very irritable now a disclaimer while on the emotional level theres tons of fear resentment and anger towards him cognitively i know where he was coming from im not saying it was right im saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow the subconscious repressed emotions or whatever term its not that they dont know the importance of working on this and letting these things out they dont even think theres anything wrong ive brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle he just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem to put it succinctly no apology my mom wasnt very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didnt see the emotional damage he thinks he had to do it but i know that in reality he was and is carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization you were driving your mom mad you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time etc im actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing lol i was also told to basically stop victimizing myself he is like this but since he doesnt go around flipping out on everybody nor did he do anything to me unjustified he was never stopped i believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate so as i said on the mental aspect i know theres no point in looking for guilty ones but emotionally i want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself when i dont distract myself with the phone or any activity some emotions come to attention i may even cry for a second this makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which i only have to let work by unclenching muscles releasing mental tension just relaxing and letting myself feel everything ive supressed for so long i feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe thats buried even deeper also im anxious about the moment i let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me like i cant make something up and yet the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible or theyd just assume i was projecting my biological fathers trauma on my uncle lol sad but ill just let go at some point and thats it ive stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family its not wise to need their understanding even if its family ive come to realize that my social anxiety awkwardness emotional coldness towards family i cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion gosh my grandma is severely ill and i struggle to be compassion like i know its there somewhere i can feel it sometimes but theres so much repressed bs covering it up irritability towards family and many other things are a result of this this is good news for me because i now know its not just random but a result of the minds shadow thats it i suppose,Positive
tw abse hello im a year old soon to be year old in an mentally and verbally abusive relationship i have been abused by my father almost as long as i can remember i have wanted out for years but i couldnt do that to my dad while my dad is an abusive human being he does have times when he seems like a great dad like when he would get me ice cream or listen and try to help me when i was bullied in elementary school i wanted to leave but since my dad still showed a nice side even though a lot of it was out of wanting to control me i thought i could fix him or make him a better father but i was wrong no matter how hard i tried to tell him what he was doing was wrong whether it was yelling loudly at me for small things or blaming his behavior on me or claiming it wasnt abuse he never listened or tried to change his behavior there was a lot more he did then that i just wanted to give some examples he convinced it wasnt abuse when i was a little kid now that i am and i am finally realizing he wont change and staying because i dont wanna hurt him isnt worth it i want out i finally took my moms offer to get full custody of me yesterday we finally sat down as a family me my mom and my stepdad my mom silt from my dad a long time ago but they never married just had a long term relationship i explained what i wanted and why they already had known about it for years and they wanted to get me out a while ago the thing is since my mom and step dad started doing research about how getting full custody would work and my mom ask her friends who had been in custody battles they figured out that it would almost be impossible for my mom to get full custody because he never hit me or assaulted me and how then can last over an year and it wasnt worth it because of how close i am to they said they really wanted to but there were so many things in the way and that it would completely ruin me and my dads relationship that is ruined all ready and how it would it be really mad for my already bad mental health i talked to my therapist about this and she said she would email my mom and try to figure something out but theres still a big chance it wouldnt work i really cant take anymore i was done a long time ago im so tired i just want it to end so im on abuse reddit looking for hel i known that states handle this kind of thing differently i live in oregon if that helps if anyone can help please do also sorry that this was long and all the background information,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

hi this is my first time in reddit anyways to keep it short my parents refused to let me inter university of my choice even though its free and forced me into the nearer college where there is like major or something like that and none of them was for me none of them was even the choice number five on my list i really tried to get into it and continue my life but i simply couldnt i couldnt study something i will never get a job with there is no jobs for me with this major so whats the point this drove me into depression more i have no future career i have a hobby which i want to develop into business but the stress from the college and my parents cant let me do anything its started to affect me physically panic attacks throwing up severe insomnia and others my parents are controlling and dont really about what anyone want hell even they dont want anything they never wanted me to be successful at all they prevented me from getting any kind of job through high school i am broke i cant even get out i am trying to make some money online but as i said stress and anxiety are eating me alive what should i do my father doesnt care that much about me going to college because either way he wont give me a penny nothing new there the problem is my mom she skipped college because of my father and my father in short is and emotionally abusive and a narcissist who mad my mothers life hell she is obsessed over college because she thinks her life would better with a degree but i know that a degree wouldnt help her leaving my father years ago so its irrelevant,Neutral
thats all i can label this as right now i am currently a f with sisters moved out and one doesnt live with me so im not counting them that means there are sisters that live with me now i didnt realize this before but my mom is a major bully i shouldve realized it from middle school when my mom read my diary she sat me down to make me watch her read it and continued to make me sit while she told me why my thoughts were wrong she also does this thing when she tells us to do something that we dont quickly do or we dont understand she talks in a way that makes us seem retarded and says because this is the only way i can make you understand my sisters encourage it by laughing but i dont think thats very funny probably because ive been called stupid twice by her and ignorant once shes also made me feel like im ungrateful i probably am i have so many electronics from her a phone a laptop a tv a tablet and she keeps food in our stomachs with a place to live but if i know one thing about manipulation its that people will do whatever it takes for you to let them keep treating you the way they are every time she and my dad would argue wed go somewhere fun like bowling or shed sit us down to talk about it and ask us how we felt she doesnt really care she has told me a lot that she doesnt care what i think that its disrespectful if i try to tell her why something isnt a good idea she would also go out of her way to explain to me her child btw whats going on with her situation with my dad why she hates him and why he doesnt care about us he does btw she also goes out to make it like somethings my fault when she couldve chosen an easier route im not comfortable talking about that story yet but she gaslights a lot i cry a lot im a pisces what can i say but when i do my mom calls me a crybaby remember when she read my diary afterward she asked me if i was done with my woe is me act but i feel like my act is a way better reaction than having temper tantrums like she does she once threw something at her bedroom door and it went into the kitchen and almost hit me not to mention the amount of times she slammed her door please dont tell me to talk to her about it because shes too stubborn even her own family sees it i cant bring in a trusted adult none of that and get this shes already in therapy i just hate this woman and i dont want to but i do i want to get out of here but i want to also protect my sisters from her all of them one of them is my half so my dad probably wont be able to take custody of her,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hi today i needed to find the answer to my question are my parents abusive growing i always knew that i was different for one im short im and im ft so i was bullied for that and anytime i try to stand up for myself my dad would beat me with his belt and i guess i was the baby of the house i didnt really had to do anything which would eventually hurt my in the future so all of these things made me weak and introverted and i think growing up we were poor one time i remember that we could afford the electricity bill and me and my sisters had to give our money to our mom to pay it my and my brother didnt even have a console or anything like that because according to my dad its a waste of time i wasnt allowed to go over to other peoples houses because according to my dad i need to study but it was perfectly fine for him to take us to his friends houses i think his beating went too far like for example he caught my older brother lets calling him tyler drawing on the walls and he beat him but one event that happened to me i will never forget one day after swim practice which i hated and got no say in my dad was cussing tyler out because i think he joked or threaten to shoot ip his middle school he was in th grade and i was in th grade i chuckled like and idoit until after i finished taking a shower when i heated my twin lets call her leah and came run to her i found out to tyler ran away and after hours we found him at the public pool i still remember that night eating food with the last fanta bottle and my sisters watching olympic swimmers it was traumatizing and i was afraid of getting beaten or getting in trouble so didnt tell my teachers or friends when i went during the summer i visited my cousins in spokane wa and after that i had to live i my parents other house because we couldnt afford to live in our original home so after weeks of sleeping and doing nothing because i didnt have a phone at the time but my sisters did because my mom had to find a way to communicate with us directly the school year started but then covid came in march and when we were released to spring break that break lasted the rest of the year even though we still had to do our work online in my th grade i was online till may to do my starr test online sucked and the teachers didnt really care about us online kids th grade year and i thought it would be different but i was wrong eventually my dad said we were moving to spokane and i was excited because it was a new start for me but when i left i winter break i barely got my old friends contacts and i have been trying to contact them ever since my new middle school was okay but i was very alone at the beginning then my freshman year rolled in and was okay oh i forgotten to mention that during my th grade year my older brother tyler to my older sister lets call her jackie if she wanted to sigh up for driving class because she as a sophomore at the time and refused this will be important later on so then my sophomore year came and it was okay at the start but it took a turn for the worst so took get money we would have to do the clothes for the patients my parents were working to take care of in fact we live above them in a basement thats why we moved here but lately we have stoped doing them because our mother wouldnt pay us on time so after weeks of this my mother came downstairs with a broom to beat my sisters and i had enough even though tyler was across from my mom i had to go and stop her and to still her to leave then my twin leah was bruised on the hand my older sister left the house for safety with my cousins and after weeks of her staying with them she came back during our spring break at the end of it in april i had to go stay upstairs to watch the patients but i had to go for my hair cut with tyler so it was leah or jamie and it couldnt really be leah because she had stayed up their for any hour but jamie could do it because she had to go out with her friend this is get too long but i will com with apart two to this so stay tune update jamie and my mom had a huge argument jamie said that her friends moms always treat their daughters better than our mom does while either they are stay at home moms or they actually manage and be engaged with daughters to cook food for them i think one of the main reasons is because we live in an adult family home where the patients live with us so my dad and my have to take care of them hours a day she doesnt have time to cook us dinner every night and the food that she does cook is for the patients which i do not eat because it used canned foods usually tyler cooks us dinner or we would have to manage on our own going back to the situation the argument escalated and my mom said if these friends moms were better than her then she should go live with them and thats what jamie did she packed some of her stuff and left when me and tyler came back me and him had no idea of the situation that happened mom was just saying how ungrateful jamie was and stuff then at around pm when i was on my phone leah came up to me to whisper that jamie was not coming back then my dad came to leah and jamie room to interrogate leah on the whereabouts of my sister which she didnt know dad then called jamie with leah phone saying you need to return now but jamie refused that night i could barely sleep because i didnt know how to process this situation what about school in days following the event i was scared that my parents will forcefully take my sister back at lunch where half the school is to each lunch i cant describe the anxiety that came so i talk to my world history about this and he had is suspicions on what was going on because jamie was acting strange in his class but when didnt have time to talk and suggest to go to the counselor office i did and talked with my th and th grade counselor and they really helped me after a couple of weeks they successfully got me sister back after wanting to ask the police to label her as a runaway honesty looking back on it now both sides to blame my parents for not wanting to talk it out they have a it our way or no way attitude one of the main reasons of jamie running is because of the lack of space in the house like i said we live in an adult family home where patients live they all have either room to themselves with an exemption but we live downstairs which is a weird living room basement hybrid they are only rooms downstairs one for my parents and one of my sisters me and tyler have no room and live in the living room it sucks because there is no privacy worse there is also a kitchen here and people can just walk in uninvited in my space so when ever i want to jack off i have to do it under my blanket and my parents what i do under my blanket as if i making cocaine under their when im just a hormonal teenager it is a nightmare living here when we first moved i thought we just be staying here for a couple of months until we bought another house to live in we actually did although that house was still going to be an adult family home the space downstairs was nice but only had bedrooms but i was still happy it a massive living room downstairs which could install a lock making it my own room but of course life could never be that easy we later found out that my parents were going to rent out the rooms for money even though we moved all of our stuff in the garage words cannot describe how shocking and devastating this news was of all the times to have privacy being a teenager had to be the most important it is also a reason i havent bring any friends to my house because im embarrassed of the patients and how unclean the house is even if it was clean there is no room to do anything everything has been okay recently but i truly wish for things to get better sometimes i look at the stars at night saying to myself when i become famous to never forget where i came from where a hormaonal teenager had to with sever paitents that need a lot of care with no room to myself and my parents being fucking bitches more updates in the future will come so stay tuned,Positive

ever since i could remember ive hated my life my sisters are spoiled and crazy to say the least they would always get their way with my mother my father was always working somewhere so he had no idea about this at the time and my brothers would always go with him because they were old enough so it would always be my abusive part of the family and yo me my mom hated me hated taking care of me hated my voice everything she would often hit me for the littlest things and every single time all i would see is her fist before getting whacked in the head i often was just left shaking and crying alone she was abusive physically and mentally often bringing me down when i accomplished something or calling me a mistake she would often encourage my sisters to do also which only hurt me worse after a year of that same process about everyday my parents started having problems my mom was having an affair with a guy who i will call pedro you see pedro was a guy who essentially drove my family to shredding its self to pieces he alone remains the one human who i want to cause brain trauma to with my fists alone he was fucking my mom without my dad knowing for about a year once my dad found out he was devastated this devested me as my dad was and still is a really good person seeing him cry hit my heart harder than a bullet pedro encouraged my mother to hit my dad as she hit me which she did and my father being the good person he is never hit her back he just avoided any physical problems from her this was when she tried to get lethal with him and almost killed us in the process she also began hitting me more and also started on my other brothers my sisters ofcourse joined in for a few weeks i endured this until i snapped at my two sisters i beat the shot out of then i was and them being and and since im naturally really strong i ended up breaking their noses and busting one of their lips my mom was not happy she cursed at me grabbed a metal rod and whacked me in the jaw breaking a lot of my teeth and drawing out a ton of blood about an hour later my dad came home and he saw my bloody mess of a face and he finally realized what my mom does to us we never told him due to fear he started yelling at my mom to the point in which she grabbed that same rod and tried to whack him in the head full force he had to run out since she could and would kill him if he didnt he essentially had to go hide out for about a day in his truck in fear for his life my mom later began packing her things and literally dragged my brothers and me to the car dropping us off on some dark alley in the middle of the night just so she can prove a point to my dad that she is not playing after she essentially abandoned us probably heading to pedros place our dad ended up finding us we told him everything and he was again devastated from the fact that she abandoned us and went with that piece of shit of a human pedro when went home our sisters were nowhere to be seen meaning that they went with her but the worst thing is that they trashed our house destroyed everything and threatened us with even worse it was so bad that we had to get legal and since we were not financially stable we could not afford a lawyer till then end of this legal battle which lasted years and since we had no evidence the cops could not do nothing no dna no cameras nothing so for about months our dad had to stay home without working just to raise us by this point i was after those months ended we heard glass shatter in a lot of windows and i recognized the people they were my mothers friends who were gangsters or just bad people the first thing they did is break the only phone that we had so we could not record nor call the cops they then demanded for us to go with them essentially a kidnapping scenario but because they caused such a ruckus our neighbor who ill call juan came out with a shotgun threatening them and scaring them off he then called the cops and some of them got arrested and they asked us to share details to them so we told them who they were sent by my mom so ofc they went and interegated her which she had her family alibi her along with her friends and some co workers ending up with an unsolved case so all we could do now is just save up money and plead in court years later when i turned we testified in court and we ended up getting re compensated k in damage and my dad got full custody of me and my brothers while my mom with my sisters and for a year we lived in piece when i turned we my dad and brother and me were evicted from out house we would remain homeless for about another year till we managed to rebt out a beat up old home to maintain us as we stay financially in trouble i later am forced to work for anything fixing cars selling candy at school lawn mowing etc selling candy was the best for me as i was a good negotiator which helped with rent just barely enough to get by and years later we still are financially struggling but now i get to feel what an average boy my age feels and ive never been so happy while my mom gets abused now by that mf pedro which is deserved but still angers me but ill let them settle it its sad that years of my life were completely shit but on the bright side im stronger physically and mentally and i will get money and i will help my dad out get his dreams when im older get him a truck or buy him a nice house in the coast as he always dreamed of mark my words note im now and am now for the first time in my life have friends note i still love my mom and my sisters note my sisters are a lot calmer now but they do drugs which is retarded but it their life now note my dads side of the family lives in my home country honduras which is why they were not involved if they were things would have ended up way better final note i left out a lot of things some are worse than this but those are things that are really personal thank you for your time and goodnight,Positive

tw family abuse suicide summary sick of supporting my mum when all she does is complain and put me and my child at risk it has been nearly years since my mum has pulled me into her dv situation emotional coercive financial abuse most recently she tried to od this week because of my dads abuse and i supported her for a few days at my place after she was released from emergency im feeling really frustrated sad and disappointed because the help i have been giving her was thrown back into my face over the last two days specifically i helped get her a counsellor appointment and secure her bankingphoneemail as my dad has all her passwords she forgot her phone code and went off at me she was the one that set it she then went on and on about how im adding more fuel to the fire by making her do stuff i wasnt i was working and im just causing her more problems and not giving her space to think ive taken time off work to help her ive spent hours collecting evidence for her when she asked and ive been getting advice and helplines and provided her phone numbers shes the one that has been running around doing stuff like talking to my dad and the other women telling me whats going on constantly and wanting to talk trying to go back to work the day after being in emergency i feel bad saying this but i told her im done because all she does is blame me its been years and shes following the same pattern where i get all the blame and become the blacksheep plus i found out she had been betraying my trust and giving my dad access to personal info like my address and pictures of my kid when i expressly asked her not to because im no contact dad abused me too am i a terrible person has anyone felt the same or can empathise,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
i was abused by my parents grandma and family friends from childhood to adulthood it was awful and painful experience there are more details about what happened like i was told that you are stupid nothing and other negative words and actions i didnt even realized how fucked up until when i was older and went to therapy for that it was not normal at all it wasnt my fault for what happened about it thank you so much for listening and texting with this it means a lot to me,Positive
to preface two things im not suggesting this itself is abuse i just think its telling about his mindset the abuse i suffered was mostly emotional and verbal and definitely compared to some of the other people here much more mild it still scarred me heavily though but that doesnt mean im not aware that many people have experienced way worse anyway that out of the way i was working with my father on something and it made me start to notice something he uses the word perfect more than anyone else ive ever known like every time he would do something he would do it very carefully and when he was finished he would talk about how it was perfect if i screwed up in any way he would get angry and insult me and at one point yelled at me that i cant do anything right when i briefly dropped a nail i was supposed to hand him i know that i as a person have kind of an obsession with doing everything perfectly and being perfect basically im extremely perfectionist its one of the reasons i have body dysmorphia because i cant stand being anything but beautiful anything less is not good enough and its part of why i have performance anxiety and struggled emotionally to get through college because if i didnt get perfect grades i would hate myself and want to die and you know i guess i just see a connection between these two things my father would constantly talk about perfection using that word and accept nothing less and yell at me or insult me if i screwed up in any way sometimes for like an hour straight and i cant accept being anything except perfect or doing anything not perfectly and i feel deeply worthless inside most of the time i guess being obsessed with perfection is not so strange when your father is constantly talking about it and yells at you for anything less this might seem obvious but im very much an adult and yet i only realized like a year ago exactly how much the guy uses that word or how it might have affected me and now that ive started noticing it i think about it every time he says it which is basically every time multiple times we work on anything together,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
we live in a very southern area kind of in the middle of nowhere to be honest and the only homeless shelter seems to not be an option for me my mom has gone back and forth a lot on whether or not she wants to kick me out but right now im going into this with the belief that she probably will she probably has undiagnosed bpd andor npd and cycles between abuse and lovebombing quite often she outed me as queer to my grandparents one of them watches farright nazi content online and has made their opinions very clear and i dont feel safe living with them im struggling mentally and ive come to the conclusion that i probably have pretty severe ocd although i dont feel safe telling my mom this as opening up about anything mental illness related has caused me to be emotionally and physically abused in the past i bring this up because social interaction is really fucking hard for me and the thought of trying to find a roommate or a job kinda stresses me out definitely moreso than it would with most people ive also been depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed most of the day which is seemingly furthering her resentment towards me im typing this on a backup cellphone that my mom doesnt seem to know about i have to keep this phone either under my pillow my bed or in one of my shoes to prevent her from finding it she took my regular phone after finding out i was extensively researching abuse and housing options she told me word for word that she knows im trying to escape and she wont make it easy on me i have maybe people who i could imagine staying with for a while but its realistically not very likely getting an online job or doing something of that sort just isnt possible as my mom took the keyboard to my computer theres really no other family that i can think of and i dont have very many friends nearby i have around bucks in my wallet at the moment but thats it i had a job but she made me quit because she didnt want to make it easy for me to escape shes mentioned me getting another job a few days ago but i dont know when that would be again i want to really clarify this we live in a very southern town with very few shelters or job opportunities i also do not have a drivers license or any kind of way to really travel public transport isnt really a thing here any kind of advice would be wonderful ill clarify anything in the comments if i need to edit i have a ldr partner and we do plan to move in together at some point but that might not be for a while due to a variety of different reasons,Positive

i get told im defensive constantly for years i get told i dont listen and that i shut down but then for example my mom reads off the label of a supplement im supposed to be taking and gets concerned that itll interact with what ive already got i try to assure her that i dont think my doctor would prescribe that to me if that was a major risk its not i just looked it up she reads off my regular meds bottle anyway and says this also causes fatigue because she refuses to listen to me in general but especially in regards to whats actually causing the disabilities that i have one of the major ones being cfs even though i try to share information videos articles infographics etc i meekly tell her that i dont think its from that thats all i say but my reasoning is because ive been fatigued for over five years and just starting taking this medication last year and she just storms out of the room wordlessly and its not just the actions but how she does things shes extremely cold and severe and yet shes normal with my father and hes the same way i just i know this subreddit would understand better than any the feeling this causes just being made to wonder if youre insane or if youre actually acting out and being unreasonable but i pack myself into a box just to try to appease my parents and try to reduce the emotional abuse today was a really fucking horrible day im having a mental episode that my mom dismissed as me just needing to eat and take supplements and drink water if i try to express that i need more emotionally i get yelled at and told that they are emotionally supportive and if i contest that i get hit with the oh i guess were awful parents then card i screamed into my pillow today to try to feel better i try talking to friends about it but what can they do why would they want to listen,Positive
okay obviously im gonna hope this remains anonymous because he wont listen to me on talking to someone about getting help but i wanna know if theres anything legal that can be done here because weve run out of options i f have been dating my m boyfriend for about months now and his mom has gotten worse throughout the course of our relationship to sum things up as a whole its a lot anytime he has a job and makes his own money she comes up with any reason on why she doesnt like that job and forces him to quit so he cant keep a job or make his own money shes very very religious and forces him to go to church every sunday and also actively attempts to force him to join a youth group or else she says shell kick him out she makes him do all the household chores he basically cleans the whole house pick up and drop off his siblings to and from school etc hes in charge of making sure theyve eaten and done their homework and if any of his siblings get in trouble for doing anything hes blamed for not being a good influence or not watching them good enough as if hes the parent in the house she manipulates him and says hes manipulative and that all he does is take from her she fat shames him and will sometimes tell him that he eats too much of their food as a grown man and that hes only allowed to eat dinner or food hes bought himself once again has no money because she makes him quit every job and then she tells him that hes lazy and cant keep a job shes emotionally abusive she always has to be the victim she lies about him cursing and yelling at her which he never does hes always calm he had a good amount of money at one time that he was payed and she told him he had to put it in a savings account that only she has access to so he doesnt spend it all so he has no access to that money as of right now she kicks him out every few months for any reason she can find and leaves him to walk the streets alone at night knowing that he has nowhere to go when he was a minor shed kick him out then report him to the police as a runaway she tells him that she doesnt think he should have a girlfriend and gets really upset anytime he spends times with me she tells him that she doesnt care about him doing certain things but then when he does them shell turn around and scream at punish him she got on him forever about how he was lazy because he wasnt in school he graduated and then he got into college for film in which he was excited to meet new people and make friends and he went for one week before she made him switch to online so that he can be home to take care of his siblings and do chores shell take his phone anytime she gets annoyed or mad while hes waiting for calls about interviews or calls from his counselor causing him to miss important calls and lose opportunities on getting a job or doing good in school and shes currently moving him into a way smaller room that hell share with his brother that will barely fit both of them so that her boyfriend and his kids can move in and shes making him get rid of his computer because it wont fit the computer he does online college on she tells him that she cant stand the sight of him or the sound of his voice a specific example would be there is one time he broke down and opened up to her about how harmful shes being and how she makes him feel helpless and she said my stomach started hurting when you got in here and it just got worse as you kept talking and said she couldnt stand him and theres much much more hes might i add again obviously legally hes an adult and can move out at any time he wants but she literally makes it impossible for him to be able to get a car or keep a job in order to make money to leave he cant live with me because i still live with my mom as well and wont be able to move out until im done with cosmetology school is there a legal route we could take like theres absolutely no way he can grow and be independent as an adult because she guilts and manipulates him into staying ive run out of options on how to help him and hes reluctant to ask for outside help but im tired of seeing my boyfriend lose who he is and give up on life because of this abusive woman,Positive

hi everyone these last few weeks have been a real eye opener to my mothers manipulation i grew up in with a very abusive emotionally and physically mother and a father who did nothing to stop it we came from mexico when my mom married my father and he adopted us so up until a few years ago i always have carried this idea that my father was my hero because he rescued us on the flip side my mother has always been the devil she would constantly yell at us saying we werent good enough we were shitty kids and that we should be embarrassed because we were wastes of money and time at one point growing up my little brother told his teacher about my mom hitting us and cps got involved but nothing came of it because my parents coached us on what to say and because my dad had a great and upstanding career in the military it went nowhere i vividly remember my mother dragging my little brother to the tub and holding his head under the water my psych eventually reframed that as attempted murder and my mind was blown anyway there are so many other stories about how she would hit us degrade us and isolated us from all the family we had in mexico and i always believed it was my fault she even slapped me in the face when i was m pregnant with my son because i wouldnt turn the heat up and she was cold funny enough my water broke after an argument with her that day ive been in therapy since and its made such a difference she was so kind and understanding and helped me process so much first none of this was my fault while it seems so easy and obvious thats something i have to tell myself everyday second my father is no white knight whenever my mom would start hitting me id run behind him for protection but he wouldnt do anything hed just sit there and keep reading the newspaper he only cared about our grades accolades and what sports we were doing three my mom has bpd this was probably the biggest nugget because her behavior was a text book example the whole i love you i hate you youre not going anywhere anyway fast forward to now contact with them is very limited and the only reason my mom reached out this year is because she needed help with her homeworkand by that she wanted me to do it well i set my foot down two weeks ago and i told my dad that if she needed this much help she needed a tutor or switch majors he said alright and i have not heard from them since im sorry if its all over the place ive just never written all of this out and it opens up a lot of wounds i have wonderful children and a loving husband and i literally wouldnt even dream of treating my kids the way my mother did to me they are loved nurtured safe and secure,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
my dad was incredibly abusive to me ant my mom he wasnt always that way he used to be kind and i used to be excited to see him home from work when i was a kid that kind man died when i was or when he turned into an alcoholic and opiate addict or rather got back into his old habits from before i was even born he became verbally and physically abusive he was even abusive to me after a drunk driver nearly killed me saying it was my fault and i never should have been out that late he stole my hydrocodone while i was bedbound and was in extreme pain from a displaced sternum and multiple other injuries that was when i decided that i hated him after i recovered and got a good paying job a small inheritance from my grandfather i moved out shortly thereafter he received a pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis and began to decline and he became more reserved and subdued especially after the double lung transplant years later he died of a stroke or heart attack from a blood clot he never apologized he never attempted to reconcile even though i branched out to him this was recent and i felt like i havent been mourning his loss because i already did so long ago however ive been having dreams its how i remember him looking from before he was sick and before he began to abuse substances ill feel the excitement that my dads home and well eat zebra cakes play cards or chess together and go fishing in the morning or build a computer together i actually smiled and sat by him i woke up crying i hate that he died the man he became and we were never able to reconcile i miss the man he was before substance abuse,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
ok so i f was adopted with my twin brother when we were little like months into a super religious household with a older sister the encouraged sibling rivalry was also insane growing up my parents literally pitted up against each other and shit got pissed whenever we switched on each other but got suspicious and accusative whenever we didnt then years later comes my little sis i think she was like some sort of miracle baby or sum cuz of how much they my parents baby her shes got one of the worst cases of spoiled sibling baby of the family entitlement shit uve ever seen my parents never treated me and my brother the same little sis constantly got shit that me and my brother didnt she got all the awesome birthdays and gifts while my brother and i got cast offs literally my what was favorite gift for christmas of a mp player turned out to be a promo addition of one of my sisters gifts it really broke me finding that out but i always found shit out the minute i shut up i became invisible so i used to my advantage cuz around there u talked to much u pissed dad off and got hit it got better throughout the years after my older sis reported him to cps but i was too young and afraid of my father to speak out against him maybe if i had we would have been able to escape that house all of us but none of us said she so she was written off as a troublemaker and nothing happened my dad always had the saying that it was good that we were scared of him maybe that way we wouldnt disobey him as i got older i started to realize that shit wasnt normal there but every time i tried to get cps involved nobody said anything against him so i was was written off as an attention seeking troublemaker so instead i gave up and just ranted to my friends instead in order to protect my siblings i would act out to keep dads attention on me so he would hit me the most i just recently moved out now im living with my bf and my dad is shunning me until i stop living in sin coming up is the end of the school year in which one of my favorite cousins always throws a party im worried they might misconstruct everything and make me out to be the bad guy so do i let them all know before they have the chance ps this is just the parental abuse not to mention the torture my little sister put me through that my parents didnt give a fuck about or my brother literally trying to kill me multiple time and then telling people i tried to kill him,Positive
i got out of my adoptive parents grasp after they tried to get me to break up with my fiance at saying i needed to focus on family and my responsibilities i wasnt allowed to drive date or even have friends loving with them it got physical and i got a domestic violence protection order against her i got out and that was in november i am now living with my fianc i have a car our own apartment even my dream dog a corgi he works while i stay home and he provides everything i couldnt have had these experiences staying with that family as i was paying her in rent while also spending every month on her animals as well as using credit cards on her animals and i had to pay on them too im so glad i got out if anyone has any similar situations let me know,Neutral
my mother beat me in the shower a few times growing up once or twice out of no where sometimes with a broom stick once with the shower head it wasnt an everyday day things and tbh i thought all kids were getting whooped just like me and that i was depressed because somthing was wrong with me did anybody else ever deal with things like that growing up,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
ive moved before but both times it was a pyrrhic victory at best because i had to end up moving back and i ended up being miserable with my new living situation this time i have to keep paying her back for the car on top of paying for rent at my new place and whatever other essentials hopefully i can land a job thatll pay me well enough to balance everything out but im still not used to this notion of freedom ive caught myself wanting to feel loved truly loved by her which i thought id long ago given up on,Neutral
i dont exactly know how to do this but i definitely dont want to talk to my family as if they act like their mine im a young adult in a indian household so if you get the gist they are strict and religious im the older f and i realize or more or less came to terms with the fact my family hates me and does not prioritize me at all let alone love me any sort of problem i have with them resulting my life with boyfriends wanting to be my own person could never happened i today started talking about an issue with my parents about how i need a new laptop where it just does not fiction and i called it cheap and old and i tried everything in my power to make this shitty hp laptop last name it i tried it my mom spirals to say you dont have a job if you saved your money you could have gotten one then my dad chimes in to say how stupid and every name of the book i can think of for the lack of intel ago ve i have but lastly my younger sister in uni shits on me too because the conversation somehow involved her when she did not need to put in her two cents and it got all the way to the point where every end conversation is why dont i ever buy my self all the important stuff and why am i not prepared to buy my own necessities i thought it be fine to ask my parents for a laptop since they got my sister one bit too long ago not ti mention a lily lemon bag and they shit on me for not paying my own bus fares or for my computer because im an adult who should have money which i get but i got let go from my job because they still blame me otherwise all the way too saying how the rent money she charges me was to help me and my spending habits and not to help them even though that what they told me at the beginning this over all ended to my mom having an ego trip saying that there are more people that pay more and go to school and i have a month too move out and i have a month too get a job or move out i know this sorry doesnt make sense and im sounding all over the place but i worked country sleepless nights this weeks to prioritize my school so i could pass my first semester they always said if i have issues to come to them for help but all i got was shit on and theres even worse causes with my parents and my space or me dealing with boys and all i can do right now is not help but cry and wish to have a fiend that understands me or like advice but i think the number one thing i was is for a family that cares about me and or loves me enough not to insult me and which me luck for school or to value how my day is and not give me shitty a five to tell me how stupid i am maybe ill find love somewhere one day but m it with my family or with a partner man i want a hug rn anyway to anyone that gone this far to read this thanks for hearing me out i hope yall have a nice day,Neutral
tw mentions of suicide and threats im usually left alone while my mom goes to school but im always too depressed to get out of bed everytime i hear the door open when she gets home i get hit with dread because i know she is going to immediately start to complain about how the place is a mess and if i defend myself i am always bombarded with insults and if we get into a argument she threatens to leave me harm me or tells me to get out of her house im she knows i am severely depressed and while writing this she has told me that she hates me and that she wished i succeeded in my suicide attempt back in and everytime i call her out she denies it and tells me that i do that to her and how i make her life miserable she has told me multiple times to go to hell and has straight up told me to kms the house is extremely nasty and borderline infested with roaches and she blames it all on me i dont want to call her abusive but at this point i dont think i can think her actions are just stress related anymore im unsure if my post will be taken down though i didnt see anything in the rules about it but i just want an answer i feel like im being gaslighted,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
hii i was told to post here thanks for noticing my thread im sorry if this is a wrong place to post this w tw child abuse fraud self harm sexual harassment i grew up in malaysia and attended college there before they made me drop out and migrated me to indonesia their home country i am working an online parttime job as a teacher to save up my parents and extended family has always been controlling about small and big things from the colour of clothes i wear daily theyre not skimpy at all to trying to put a wedge between my friends my exes and my current so even my boss for insisting that he wires my salary to me when they knew they couldnt coax the boss they wrote a letter impersonating me and forged my signature they cut me off of people they cant control basically i believe they care about me and want to stop me from dangerous people and yet they blamed me when a guy they were shipping me with and another teacher tried to sexually harass me and told me i was lucky that some people relatives whatsoever like to fondle with my thighs and my ass they constantly blame the people in my life for ruining our family relationship and label my friends and so as manipulative it was hard to see as the abuse was mostly emotional there were instances of physical violence too grabbing my wrist and spraining it and bruising my thigh i dont know if it was intentional nevertheless i was going down the deep end self harming daily sometimes several times a day and close to deleting myself from life im turning this november and ive been planning to move out since the first year of highschool and ive worked a stable online teaching parttime job i have recently created my own bank account and have a decent amount of money saved it isnt as much as i initially expected because my parents confiscated my yearworth of salary another finance worry aside from college i researched but i have no idea how insurance and taxes work i am uneasy because they are forcing me to resign once i start college in indonesia in september my boss was understanding and we previously discussed about having me on leave until i can stably move out and continue my job im still worried that things will go wrong and i end up moving out with nowhere to go i looked up housings and asked a friends mom whose job is a housing agent and found out i need my identification card to rent a house room however i cant physically survey them yet since they have me locked in the house only going out for church with their tight supervision im still thinking if i need to relocate to a different city in case my family ends up finding me the thought of what theyll do terrifies me it will be in the first semester of college when i move out hence theres a chance ill be in the dorms during the weekdays i just gotta have my identifications with me either by sneaking it out when i visit home for birthday or with a civil standby currently i have my identification card with me my birth certificate high schools graduate certification and passports are withheld but i know the location provided they dont move it i found out from my indonesian friend that i can phone the cops to come as a civil standby in case any violence happens and i always loved my family and thus ive tried reasoning a lot with myself asking if im just being a bad daughter that maybe if i studied more and get that a and not just an a or b or if i am a bit more perfect like they asked of me theyd love me as i am i guess my parents thought they were right as they mentioned they were raised that way too i hate to admit it but i feel guilty moving out since my parents and extended family are now unemployed of course there were happy glimpse but lots of things they did and are doing doesnt sit right and i feel like im about to lose it everyday many told me to get out and not look back and i came to terms that its for the best its still one scary thing to think about though thus if i may im asking advice about successfully moving out in indonesia opinions from any countries are appreciated too what are the things that could go wrong and i should watch out for any other thoughts your story that you wanna share if youre still here thank you for staying and reading my lengthy blog and may heavens bless you with a cute kitten puppy any animal you like take care w,Positive
so my previously abusive family are now helping me our with my daughter months because im doing it solo right now i moved back in with my dad about a year ago a couple months after i found out i was pregnant lately there has been some discussion about my independency which i find odd because i left home in and barely came back until last year because of the toxicity it wasnt until i literally ran out of the house with my belongings that the family decided to take what i have to say seriously i was usually the scapegoat anyways i find it hilarious when my dad or sister or anyone else tries to insinuate i dont know how to be independent aka never asking for help and choosing to struggle when there are better options which is such a heavy heavy poverty and lack mindset imo call it entitlement but i think they should think to themselves how shitty they were to me growing up and be thankful i have chose to let the pain go and not seek revenge or pettiness anyways i am grateful for them slowly changing their ways im using the abuse i faced as a catalyst for a better life for me and my lo,Neutral
up until a few weeks ago i thought my only real parental problems were with my biological father who was physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my brother until he cut me off on my th birthday for being gay now here i am eight years after losing one shitty parent having to make the choice to cut off the other my moms an alcoholic she started drinking heavily when i was in middle school she went to rehab and she really seemed like she got better she relapsed for the first time when i was just starting high school she relapsed for the second time when i was about to graduate high school she relapsed for the third time three weeks ago shockingly the alcoholism is far from the main reason i have for cutting her off but its what made me realize a pattern of behavior for her my mom is a very selfish narcissistic woman i love her i do but everything my whole life has always been about her or about my brother her favorite child i have no ill will towards my brother hes one of my best friends he had a lot of open struggles with mental illness growing up and all of my moms however performative support was focused on the child who needed it ive always been the easy kid the quiet one the responsible well adjusted mature one i learned from a really young age that trying to talk about my struggles wouldnt do anything anyways it would always turn into my mom crying about being a horrible mother and a failure of a parent because how could she have two depressed children she called me the other week at pm on a work day i work evenings so i was only about two hours into my shift she decided that was the perfect time to drop the bomb that she relapsed the whole phonecall was full of her saying i wanted i needed i felt not caring that i was at work not caring at all how this would make me feel to hear knowing that id have to go back to work and pretend everything is fine for six more hours it made me realize she never really cared at all as long as it was what she wanted what she needed how it made me feel never mattered i havent spoken to her since that phone call now im sitting here at what is currently am on a work night sick to my stomach from crying all day thinking how much easier it all wouldve been for everyone if i wasnt born at all never seemed to make much of a difference to my parents at least ive got my aunt and my stepdad sorry for the novel feeling a lot of things right now,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

a rather random question i guess but i find it interesting has the abuse you experience affected at all what media you consume like what kind of music what kind of movies what kind of video games etc for me i think it has very much predisposed me to enjoying heavy moody and emotional music like breaking benjamin evanescence and linkin park and for like tvseries video games again i think it has predisposed me to heavily emotional darker etc stuff like two of my favourite video games are halo ce and bioshock infinite that first one may seem a little bit odd to people who dont know much about halo because its a shooter not exactly a super emotional personal story but the thing about it is that halo really deals with being isolated on this mysterious ring in a completely unwinnable and hopeless fight and fighting on anyway in the face of hopelessness and isolation and i think that really resonates with me and then bioshock infinite without talking about spoilers id say it has one of the most emotional and one of the darkest relationship between two main characters out there so yeah i think the abuse tends to have made my taste in media very emotional very dramatic very dark and very much aimed at stuff like isolation connection hope and hopelessness etc,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
do i need to forgive my mom if she is verbally physically abusive towards my dad i guess blood is thicker than water so i want to forgive go back to having a relationship with her i also keep thinking i am not a perfect human ive my share of hurting others so why not forgive another human i also cant help but keep going back to the question how id have reacted if the genders were reversed in the abuse im at my mid point in life years its emotionally draining tbh,Neutral

exactly as the title says im using an anonymous account because i am too ashamed im living with my parents and they especially my mother believe im not able to fend for myself and be a top student like many of mine or my familys acquaintances she is forcing my study schedule she is forcing me to study for the exams i havent passed from last year even though i have to study for the upcoming finals as well she always comes into my room under different pretexts when i ask her why she says its her right my dad agrees with her at times a few days ago she also checked out my whatsapp messages when i showed her some proof for enlisting in some workshop event organized by my college my phone is secured fingerprint and all that yet she broke my privacy at first opportunity she even had the audacity to tell me that my phone shouldnt be secured and my dad agreed with her she saw that i was contacted by a scammer to which i havent replied but she started getting insane anyways she has also forced me to install a family locator app life to be exact when i was in senior year of hs because she thought i wasnt going to take my graduation exam but she also uses the excuse that she could see me when i am in trouble and her colleagues are using it for their children one of them saved her daughter from being rped she compares herself to her boisterous colleagues almost every day and she wishes she could praise me as much as they do with their teenage or collegeaged offsprings and that includes former classmates of mine from hs or middle school presentday colleagues from uni and even my cousins it doesnt help that when i went yesterday for a lab i did the most idiotic things that only a person in need of psychiatric help would do they both think im mentally ill and bringing them shame due to my failures they also think im a burden they generally treat me worse than a kid including the time when i was an actual kid they havent beaten me at all or very rarely when i was that age especially with the belt but she started doing it a few months ago and now i have trauma and flashing images whenever i see a belt the first thought would be why am i not leaving from their house well in order for me to be accepted into a dorm id have to live in an area that is not under the immediate conscription of my city which is impossible since im living in the city itself and i cant get a job because of my college schedule so no rent for me either i wanted to leave to another cityanother country when i graduated from hs but didnt have the money and the grades its still a frustration to this day i wanted to leave for other reasons as well besides my family,Neutral
how has your parents abuse affected your academic performance i remember when i was and my parents split they were screaming and offending each other the entire day my father was keeping us awake for an entire week police came several times he said he was gonna kill himself he was screaming all night and terrorizing us until the police was called at the end after he started threatening to murder my mom in the middle of the night he moved to another country afterwards i had to miss an entire school week because i was too exhausted and scared to sleep during all of this when i got back to school i got screamed at by my teacher who accused me to skip school and being irresponsible and childish my mother and her entire family told me to not say anything related to their divorce at school so i kept my mouth shut years have passed since then and i am attending a new school now since last year but more recently i cant focus at all i have constant brain fog each time i hear the voice of my abusive and neglectful mother it kills every thought that was forming in my head hearing her is always bad news the only reasons she talks to me are to either complain or scream and guilt trip me over everything sometimes she starts fights out of nowhere and starts screaming at me i usually just break down and try not to cry because i cant handle people screaming it takes so much time and effort that i cant even manage to properly do my homework sometimes also i just recently came the realisation that i have several traumas which for some reason are coming to the surface right now and are impacting me pretty badly most of them are because of my great upbringing seriously my mom brags about her parenting skills and even goes into detail to explain why they are superior i cant even manage to get therapy i am still having a rough time i feel completely empty even though i am trying to distract myself from my inner state recently i got back my math exam and i was devastated i used to be an a student up until months ago and now i am afraid if i am gonna get a failing grade my teacher showed dissapointment he told me that i could do better and that it is a pity teachers opinions matter a lot to me so it hit me like a rock i am actually still debating with myself if i should at least tell him that i am having problems outside of school which impacted my performance recently while also offering him to do some extra work,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

long story short my parents tried to claim that the abuse sa physical emotional was a result of our norwegian culture they go on to say they provided for us giving us everything we actually needed just as god has when they were initially confronted they adamantly denied any of the abuse whatsoever fell back on religion telling us that were horrible christians and going straight to hell if we dont forgive and repent theyve since admitted to lesser instances of the actual abuse that took place yet they still think that they are somehow next to god and use religion to manipulate their adult children religion is solely a tool for them to justify their abuse and is the reason i cant step foot in a church today,Neutral

over time ive realized theres a deep hollowness inside of me a darkness that swallows everything up a hurt that never truly goes away it can only be treated and thats only when i find someone im in romantic love with who seems to love me back i cant be sure where this hollowness comes from but i suspect its due to my parents emotional abuse to be clear the abuse i experienced is actually pretty tame compared to a lot of other people here have experienced i think i still sometimes question myself on whether i should call it abuse at all but based on the articles ive read about the topic it seems that it probably was anyway i guess im asking about how many of you feel the same way where theres like an underlying pain or hollowness that you cant ever quite get rid of you can only find ways to temporarily soothe it,Neutral

i have posted before about my dad being a narc and had loads of other mental health we dont have a good relationship and i actually do hate him anyway im living at home with my father he had a very weird view that i should be grateful for him and he can treat me anyway he pleases because hes my dad and hes the authority figure he has absolutely no respect for me but demands i treat him with the upmost respect due to my personality i dont take his shit i challenge him back i wont let him speak to me like shit and when i set a boundary its over my dead body will he break it although he trys to break them every single day my dad currently doesnt work hes on benefits due to his mental health and it meant i became a young career has the years have went on ive released the whole young career wasnt in fact what i was my dad just gave me parent responsibility and stresses from about the age of that includes cleaning he is a messy person so i have to clean up after him cooking my meals and his financial burdens his mental health dumps etc i recently mentioned how it would be nice to get a new cooker and fridge freezer i never said i was going to just mentioned that it would be nice he took it upon himself to go buy a new fridge freezer never told me he was doing it or how much the fridge freezer he bought was k and is claiming i owe of it so half basically putting me into debt without my knowledge or agreement i absolutely refuse to give him the money it has caused crazy amounts of arguments and i tell him im on a budget and i cant afford to lose he then goes on to tell me i can pay it back a month is he joking when i refused this as well he then started saying the only reason you arent willing to pay for half is because im up to my eyes in debt which is not true at all he said that because i use the fridge freezer then i have added to the deterioration of it and thats why i need to pay half please bare in mind the fridge freezer wasnt even broke and didnt need replacing i moved in with my dad when i was years old thats how long we have had it i was a child i feel like when its a parents house its on them to pay for the up keep of their own house and that includes appliances i plan on moving out this year so im paying for a fridge freezer that he will then keep for the next years it doesnt make sense he believes this should be the case if anything needs to be replaced in the house carpets cookers washing machines etc i did mention he was on benefits but i can assure you hes got no shortage of money when it comes to buying things for himself or his hobbies im happy to accept if my thinking is wrong and he is in the right but it just doesnt sit well with me,Positive
hello years ago my family and i moved into a duplex the neighboring family consist of a couple and their kids the parents are probably like but they could fool me they look like theyve been on drugs for decades ive had my experience with druggies and some of the interactions ive had with them made it very clear to me theyre on something their oldest son is ill call him aaron second oldest seems middle school age ill call her sarah then theres two little ones young elementary age for sure due to the fact that our houses are basically glued together i can overhear a ton of fighting going on in there usually with aaron and the parents or aaron and sarah some of the stuff ive overheard is really brutal there will be times where i dont hearsee the parents for days their car is usually gone during these times which leads me to believe they are just abandoning their kids and leaving aaron to take care of them he goes to work during the day so whos taking care of them then the middle schooler no one theres been a couple times ive tried to go over there to check it out when i think the two little kids are alone just to make sure theyre okay and see whats happening they never answer the door which i understand ive taught my kids to not answer for anyone as well but i just really want to find out whats going on and honestly im curious to see the state of that house on the inside nosiness aside ive talked to aaron a handful of times he looks fully worn out constant fighting is exhausting enough but then being abandoned to take care of your siblings who knows if the parents even take care of the children when they are around ive told my kids to steer clear of them i do not want my children ever interacting with their parents my heart aches for those kids aaron shouldnt have to be a father to them they should be in a stable loving home the obvious answer is to call cps but i know this can also open up a whole new can of awful things for the kids being separated worse homes my thought was that this would be taking aaron out of his fiona gallagher nightmare but my wife thinks there might be a reason why he hasnt called cps on his own yet she has a point i need input about this,Positive
help please im years old and im experiencing abuse from my parents about half an hour ago i experienced a very scary situation with my dad my parents and i are usually very close but whenever they had mad it gets really bad me and my father were watching a movie like normal and then he spiraled i started talking to him but he didnt like the way my voice sounded sometimes it gets high pitched due to puberty voice crack etc so he started drilling his finger into one of the sides of my skull i told him to stop but he wouldnt until i hit him in the stomach he then started aggressively grabbing and gripping my body specifically my arms and chest i still have red marks and bruises from how hard he was doing it when i managed to pull myself away i told him that what he did was child abuse and that it was an offense he then proceeded to say these exact words to me if you ever call the cops the day you call the cops on me theyll find nothing but a corpse by this point i was really scared this wasnt the dad that i knew he would never have said anything like this i tried to confront him to repeat that while holding my phone out trying to record it he obviously didnt repeat it into the recording but instead said that i was the one who said that phrase i then put it down and told him that if he knew what he just did and what he said i told him that people have ruined their whole lives saying that have gone to prison and everything he then got mad and grabbed me again aggressive this time pulling out his phone and typing into the dial of his phone he held it out in front of me while grabbing and hitting me and told me to call the cops if i wanted he was yelling at me to call them i yelled stop and what was he was doing i asked him to realize what he was doing he then put his phone down and started punching pulling grabbing gripping and kicking me all simultaneously while yelling at me i dont remember much of what he was saying i was in shock im sure he was just repeating the same thing over and over about calling the cops and about making me ruin his life i also remember him yelling to call my mom theyre divorced to pick me up to take me to her house but shes working so that didnt work out i told him that i never stopped the recording on my phone and that it caught all of that which was a bluff he finally stopped he then started searching for my phone probably to destroy it i had hid it under the sheets so despite all that he looked he couldnt find it i told him to just leave the room and he finally did after that i was really scared and tried texting my mom i told her everything that happened and she blamed it on me she said it was my fault and that i provoked him that its because of my behavior she said its because i always cause problems despite being divorced they both still talk and she always supports him when we get into a fight because she wants to stay on his side to collect benefits were going on a vacation soon and hes paying for all her expenses on the trip i then told her that he needs to talk to him and get it together how could you think that after what he said and what he did that hes the one whos the victim she then told me that if i ever were to tell anyone or report it to anybody that he would kill himself and that there id be left with nothing she said that the officers would take me to a childrens home and live a horrible life she continued on with this a little more saying that im the reason this happens that its my behavior that im the root of all problems and that id be the reason they kill themselves an extra detail i want to put in i live with my dad and my grandma but i didnt think to go to my grandma about this she was in the other room when this happened because i knew she would back him up even further whenever we get into fights she always supports my father despite whatever he does even when he does some truly messed up things when she comes to bring me dinner later she doesnt say anything she pretends nothing happened i believe this is because she knows that this time he did mess up that he was the one in the wrong im scared of what she might to support him though thinking about his death threat has made me thought that she would be capable of that as well as long as to support her son from anything ever happening to him another add on i sleep in the same room as my grandmother due to us moving homes right now so i dont have my own room where i can lock myself away from them please help i dont feel safe and i dont know what to do i dont feel safe sleeping

we were bickering about something that occurred with my grandmothers phone and she began to raise her voice so i did the same in defense she then proceeded to tell me to stfu and yell at me again and ill kick you in the fing head then began to tell me how she would take me out to the backyard and beat me black and blue with a pipe if i didnt continue my school work i am homeschooling so that is near impossible and went on to tell me that any officer or cloister would take her side because violence is the only option and it works and then continued to tell me how she would kick and punch me in the head and beat me with the pipe and my grandmother who i live with would have no right to stop her or say anything because it would be hypocritical to stop her and not stop my uncle who used to lay his hands on his kids,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts

my dad has done so many things in my life that are not considered normal for instance he cut off all my hair with a pair of kitchen scissors as i begged him not to i pleaded and pleaded but he cut it by force since then every tiny little thing i do that lands me in a bit of trouble he uses it against me and the instance in which he even cut off my hair to begin with all i did was tell my sisters tutor that im having trouble with biology and school is difficult he then proceeded to tell my father that im an unserious student that combined with petty complains of my unclean room and leaving dishes upstairs made him beat me up with a belt till i was bleeding and forcefully cut off my hair im a girl by the way so this was very demoralzing and i became slightly depressed and had zero self confidence my mum is barely any help whatsoever she sometimes switches up and joins his side by adding fuel to the fire and if not she leaves and goes upstairs with the rest of my siblings so they dont witness all of this i once went upstairs and pleaded and cried with her to make my dad stop and she looked at me with a pitiful look on her face and said theres nothing she can do theres many instances this has happened and i can broadly mention them once i put on press on nails and i was told they were too long they were not that long and i was told to remove them but then i forgot and the following evening he beat me up and almost cut my hair but luckly i hid the scissors prior this has been off and on and my dad is bipolar because later on he can start calling me his sweet girl and act all lovingly to me trust me this is not the start theres so much more i can say i cant go to a trusted adult because this is deemed as normal i also tried talking to a few teachers about it and theyve done nothing whatsoever im only please give me any advice,Positive
iam male and my sister is we live in pakistan ever since the farthest can recall my life i have always been subjected to a life of blatant favoritism neglect and abuse regarding favoritism my sister was always the epitome of success and perfection amongst my parents and relatives alike everything she did even if it was wrong was just passed off as a minor mistake by a princess she was an average grade student throughout her school life an a student in middle school and pretty average throughout highschool th to th and thth her results were always celebrated and she always recived tons of gifts whenever our distant relatives would come over or we would go to their houses she would always be greeted with such excitement and whatnot given gifts cash etc meanwhile i was told to shut up and sit in a corner rarely got minor gifts and some slim money her pocket money has been pkrmonth since she was which isnt alot in first world countries but very valuable here meanwhile i have only been getting pkr since years old she would always have her friends over and i would be told to go to the rooftop for the time being her friends was there i wasnt even allowed on the second floor of our house and the rooftop in the cracking heat of the sun has only tiny shed with tools bricks boxes and cobwebs and whatnot during special occassions and festivals like eid or birthdays mine would never even be celebrated i wouldnt even be wished most of the time while her celebration would be for days her birthday and the day before it with again gifts and cash and whatnot also i only got a mobile phone at after working in manual labour in construction for year for hours after school and saving up the money id get at the end of the day the only electronic my parents ever bought me was a cheap tiny iball tablet at years old which upon reciving they forcefully took it from me saying just let your sister play on it for some time which she broke after raging in a videogame i broke down crying that day and never forgot oh and she had an ipad at that time a genuine ipad pro and a good spec panasonic phone btw all paid for by my parents as a year old ofcourse i didnt want to do construction labour i wanted to play have friends and have fun like any other child my parents forced me into it saying youll have to make money one way or the other we already take care of your sister so youll burden us even more you are a boy so make it work this is just scratching the surface i might write more in the future there is so much more i want to write about their favoritisim but lets cover the other topics aswell regarding neglect most of the times when i would be sick with excruciating fever and other flus for days my father wouldnt even give me medicine saying suck it up walk it off already drink some water and whenever id try to sleep to alleviate the pain hed always wake me up and force me to walk its only after multiple days that hed finally call a local travelling doctor for a checkup he woould also try to cheap out on medicine like it was a game mind you the checkup and medicine together costed less than a dollar and he was still hesitant to pay for it one february when i was years old i woke up with extreme pain in my abdomen area it felt like constantly being stabbed and torched at the same time and it did not stop i woke up crying i did not know what it was i would always vomit anything i consumed any liquid food anything after days of excruciating non stop crying not being able to sleep and harming myself only did he take me to a hospital where upon checkup i was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis only then did i recieve treatment and finally healed for the love of god these are just instances there are way more like the times my parents would go on trips with my sister and leave me alone in the house often with no food at all regarding abuse oh boy where do i start this brought me so much trauma even writing about it will probably make me unable to sleep tonight firstly when i was my sister forcefully took my turn to play a retro game on my parents computer i could just watch her play so i did she sucked at the game and would punch the keyboard a few times id tell her to stop shed break it eventually she lashed out and broke the keyboard keys flew everywhere and it was completely cooked i rushed to my dad and told him what happened i told him what my sister did with as much fear and truth as an year old could emmit my father upon reaching there saw my sister get up from her chair casually just pick her phone up from the desk and say hes the one who did it and my father completely believed her like no suspicion at all you know what he did next took out a broomstick and started thrashing me mercilessly i jumped back and started crying asking him why is he doing this multiple times shes the one who broke it he slapped me across the whole face multiple times my mother didnt give a single fuck and was reading a book with headphones in he tied a rope to my a fucking year olds arm and took me outside he took me to the tree in the field next door and tied me up there while slapping me multiple times locals came and asked what he was doing he made multiple excuses and exaggerated things until someone he knew came and told him something regarding not to tie under this tree no one goes under this tree because of some paranormal bullshit so my father took my home and locked me in the storage room upstairs nd floor and smashed the broken keyboard on my head and locked me in for the rest of the day all i had was a pot of water and nothing else i was only unlocked after the sunset and given no food whatsoever all i could do was sob and cry sitting in the darkness while i tried to assemble the broken keys back onto the keyboard this is just one instance oh no there is so much more one day idk what age i dropped pkr way way way less than a single dollar and my punishment well kicked from home for the day not the first time at all then i was dragged back and tied up infront of my home and given water in a pot like a fucking animal idk what happened after that during the day but it was not fucking plesant oh just to showcase the irony my sister stole k pkr from my parents locker something percent her dads monthly income hes never been a dad to me and casually defended herself like nothing happened at all my parents believed her like she was god all eyes were on me and even though they had no evidence on me i was kicked out of the house after being beaten and went to live with my aunt for a few days during my third day at my aunts my sister stole another k pkr from my parents locker this time i wasnt there so how could it be me heres how i know it was my sisters doing after i returned home i suspected her to the core that night at she messeged me saying smoothie tonight my treat i was suspicious i asked her whats the catch why being nice to me she just told me to relax and shed bring it over to me after mins i was way too sus eventually after she brought it i dipped my pinky in it and tasted it it tasted bitter like something had been mixed in it i thought it might be berry stems she forgot to remove but i was sceptical she always kept barging into my room multiple times asking if i drank it i replied wait im busy ill put the glass outside when im done i was sure that she was trying to poison me but then i remembered about the money i immediately dumped the smoothie in a polythene bag and hid it behind my wardrobe and pretended to my sister that i drank it i knew she put her sleeping pills into it and i was right after hours am she slowly came into my room slowly turned on the lights poked my head a few times i pretended to be dead fucking asleep dead asleep but i wasnt due to the paranoia i didnt make a single move not a single word and saw from underneath my blanket her opening my parents locker it was in my room with a duplicate key and look for any money they might have left there still after minutes she couldnt find anything because they moved it all to the bank she just left next day i told my parents they questioned me doubted me etc etc but the pussies didnt dare confront my sister my sister was always spoiled and threw a tantrum on every minor in convience my parents always fed her delusions and was visibily scared by her well a week after that alot happened they discovered her being in severe debt and having written down the amount she stole in her diaries the people she gotta pay back what more she gotta steal etc etc my parents being the absolute pussies cuddled up to her ears old btw this happened in fucking like a fucking toddler and she said she didnt steal anything and it was her money and she took a loan etc etc for an ai course my parents believed her without a doubt paid off her debt and went back like nothing happened she conned them like her bitches she had no course she is a university dropout she doesnt study has books and never did they see that she doesnt fucking study the night after that they discovered she sent nudes to over guys and has been sending for the past years after lying to them she doesnt talk to any guys my aunt caught her when she was at her house they discovered that when she was in university all she did was skip classes go to bars drink behind their backs take addictive substances and sleep with multiple guys they discovered the pictures of her and her guy friends her in their car drinking smoking and pictures of her and a dudes in hotel rooms she had absolutely no shame and day after that my father just said lets forget anything even happened and just went back to normal without even confronting her shes still doing these things but they wont listen to me i have lost all hopes in them and want to cut them off asap of the things are unmentioned academic unfairness privacy breach etc etc if you read this far thank you and i appreciate you,Positive

why do people do this it baffles me it truly does i was victim of an abusive mother and i went no contact years ago and never speak her name i will never post about her on social media i have deleted all traces of her from my life however sil will tell anyone and everyone how bad her mother was to her as a child and was estranged from her most of her adult life but heres what i dont get she truly was an evil woman who beat her kids drank herself silly everyday had affairs and went on holiday and left them to fend for themselves mil died in the last years and all sil does now is post constantly about her mother and how shes missing her and painting this false image to the world that her mother was this person she wasnt she is always posting about the milestones her mum is missing her engagement her upcoming wedding and how things would be different if she was here im thinking that is a lie she didnt even bother to go to your graduation why would she care if u were getting married i am really baffled as to why people lie when someone dies like all the bad they did never happened and suddenly they are the best mother that ever existed yesterday she posted one of her usual posts with pics of her and her mum when she was a kid the usual garbage seeking attention and late last night i posted something on my instagram about my own healing journey and she replied so true for real etc but today she will prob post another attention seeking post for sympathy can someone explain why people do this this person ruined your childhood with abuse they left scars that no time heals they die and suddenly they are promoted to saint hood overnight and can do no wrong but when you talk to me u will tell me all the evil things she did but on facebook u tell a different story i cant bare this attention seeking,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
