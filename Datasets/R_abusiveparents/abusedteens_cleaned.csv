i m still live at home with mom and her bf while i pursue my nd associates degree my parents got divorced when i was overall growing up was not ideal my father was physically and verbally abusive as well as an alcoholic and my mom not much better just more verbally abusive although she has laid hands on me and my youngest sister a couple times my older sisters and my grandparents practically raised me throughout the years my parents got divorced because they both cheated on each other the man my mom is with is the man she cheated on my dad with so theres some resentment there to begin with i currently am little to no contact with my dad due to actions postdivorce that i simply cannot forgive during the custody talks i basically was met with a decision of choosing the lesser of two evils when it came to who i wanted to live with so i ultimately chose my mother during the divorce my mom paid no mind to me she cared more about getting child support out of my dad as well as appeasing her new boyfriend she posted about it publicly on facebook and garnered sympathy the only person that ever checked on me was my oldest sister i admittedly still am not over the divorce because i feel as though i never got any form of closure from that point to now my mom has been one of the most shallow people ive ever known in my life even more than when she was with my dad she makes me feel like a burden to her as well defending her bfs questionable actions i believe him to be a carbon copy of my dad my mom has defended him when he was made downright awful statements sexual in nature toward my sisters as well as girls that i brought over in the years ive known him i recall a time my mom telling me i wish i met bf earlier on that way i couldve divorced your dad and you wouldve been a better student and a better athlete in high school i hear that in my head every night when i lay down on top of that my mom has this obsession with being skinny so she makes comments about my weight even though i have been told my body is perfectly normal by my doctor and others around me this got to the point it hurt me so much that ive started wearing shirts that are sizes bigger she says awful comments to me over petty things for example there was a sweatshirt on my floor this morning because i took it off after i got hot in my sleep and she tells me why cant you keep your room clean you cant seem to do anything right or if i leave a plate in the sink she tells me how much of a slob i am if something is not done to her specifications or the way she wants it i dont stop hearing about it until the end of the day i get told that im useless that ill never be able to live on my own or that no girl will ever wanna marry me today i reached a breaking point and left to go to my oldest sisters house my mother called me shortly after i arrived and continued to berate me over the phone telling me i dont do anything around the house and that im useless and that im just like my father maybe im not making it sound as bad as it is im a terrible storyteller but these last years with my mom have been nothing but a stain on my mental health i cant tell her how i feel because she tries to turn it around on me and make me feel bad ive always struggled with depression since i was a child and ive just kind of learned to live with it however as of recent the thought has been swirling around to just take my own life i firmly believe that i am not good enough for anyone or anything in this world that if i am not worthy of a mothers love am i worthy of any love at all its been years of build up and i just dont know what to do ive tried counseling and medication none of it helps im not financially stable enough to move out and neither of my sisters nor my grandparents have the room to take me in im making this post as a last ditch effort to seek advice or even words of encouragement thank you to all for taking the time out of your day to read this
i am honestly on the verge of self harm i cant even block them because i feel like its wrong if i do i am still so under their spell i feel like if i block them thatll upset them can someone tell me to do it for my own sake i know this is with context but i dont have the energy to even say more than this i already went as far as to stop sharing location but thats scaring me so bad i thought they would call the cops they still might
sorry that this is long its complicated every time i share any part of my situation with my mother no one understands what im going through so im just gonna try to keep it short lots of my siblings agree that my mother is abusive and so does my father idk what started this whole issue but someday the peace that once existed within my family was absolutely destroyed leaving me with a life where my mother tries to take over the family with legal power and abusing the power of being a guardian ps she identifies as a christian and has strictly believed many things in the bible since divorce processes take a while especially when youre trying to manage a family business your wife wont put the effort into assisting in the way you have been in the past decade she has a lot of power against what belongs to who involving the kids the reason why i know so much about all this is because my mom starts drama about almost anything in front of us whether its about the kids or about the marriage im lucky that no one in my family thinks what shes doing is fair but she uses her legal right to control the family and my younger siblings struggle with deciding which parent to obey especially when they are afraid of what the mother will do if they disobey her unreasonable demands im more defiant thankfully shes out of the house most of the time because of everything thats going on ps she plays the victim a lot by using facts yet morphing them into points that dont make sense for the disagreement if that makes sense if she doesnt use facts shell just make her feelings the priority even when what should be the priority is logicthe point of the problem im living in hell when my dad isnt there to make things right though so ive tried my hardest to keep as much distance as i can when i need to things got wild the night that im writing this bc my mom has reattempted to take things related to the family and the love that once existed between my parents me and my siblings were there waiting for her to leave to the place she said shed go to the first thing she tried to take was a gift that she made for my father and her reasoning of why she should be able to take it was i made it myself and now i want it back my family agreed that thats not how it works but of course my parents arent officially divorced so she has legal ownership but it was morally wrong in short things got rough and my mother didnt seem to care about what we were feeling and she wouldnt stop physically trying to take a gift from my fathers hands when she cooperated she made it seem like she was forced to instead of her agreeing to bc it was the right thing to do it was a hurtful experience that i wish could be deeply understood without sharing too much info but this experience combined with many others has left me with the aching wish of her not living also because once the divorce process is done and things calm down she still lives life easy by relying on the money my father has earned by handling the business which is undeserved knowing what my father has had to go through these past months graphic ive imagined many things around the house in my hands as a tool to mash the side of my mothers head ive never remembered my mother suffering through any kind of injury so the thought of her suffering a lethal one after years of living an easy life was a comforting dream for me this is my first time sharing something like this at this degree and having it be so public but im doing this bc i have no one to talk to and i feel like no one understands believes or cares about what im going through other than my father sorry for making this long i needed to add context to the complexity of her ridiculous logic idk how views and impressions work on social media but if you read all of this and actually care abt what im saying tysm please respond and tell me if you think what im saying is stupid or if it makes sense and ig share your thoughts on it but yeah
my life has been a train wreck im only now and ive already survived human tracking and various forms of abuse both in relationships and family settings not all things are horrible for me i finally found my first real group of friends and i get the opportunity to go to college aswell as have a roof over my head buti have never had real help or support for most of my life at times my mom is the best mom ever others she is pure pressuring a recovering anorexic to go on a weight loss pillwhich i did for a while i try very hard to make her happy and at ease but when she catches me being unproductive and giggling in my roomits like i committed a crime there are times i do loose track of time when talking with my friends or making art but everything with her and my dad is on eggshells all the time i love them but their personalities shift so much i am working long hard hours to try and save for my own place but i dont even know how to do taxes or where to go for help
he can be such a controlling asshole who i cant say anything about while he uses me to feel better about himself but he has his moments where i do feel for and understand him and times when he can make me actually feel my potentialbut its all overshadowed when he does the exact opposite so i ask myself why do i feel so guilty around him why is it i feel so much hatred yes love for him i dont get it when he dies i will be the last one crying at his grave while i carry his casket wtf kinda child am i
is there some physiological reason my mom cries after screaming and hitting me and my siblings my mother is physically mentally and emotionally abusive she gets very mad very easily and tries to blame me and my siblings for everything that ever goes wrong or went wrong in her life its not like the physical abuse is happening is very day sometimes she lasts a whole month without hitting us but this physical abuse started happening when i was and and i am now about to turn my two sisters are and and even they cant escape from our mothers abuse even tho the physical abuse doesnt happen everyday there is not a day where my mother doesnt scream at us we just got out of a fight that included her yelling at us and attacking us for no reason even tho she swears its our fault and she started crying and now she locked herself in her room and is probably crying she has no reason to cry shes the one who is abusive so why is she crying why does my mother cry after shes done hitting us there was to be some physiological explanation for this
i just dont know how to cope with the comments that my mother gives me they are mostly negative in relation to my weight and appearance please be kind i grew up with my mother as my main parent for a lot of my childhood my real father was extremely abusive to her and we ran away i was forced to see him every fortnight by the courts and the memories of the things he did still haunts me as soon as i was legally an adult i cut him out of my life my mother herself will admit that she had a narcissist mother who would often be violent show little feelings of love or comfort towards my mother she would often not feed my mother resulting in my mother being emasicated and extremely unwell when my mother describes herself as painfully thin she often smiles about this and acts proud although not diagnosed with an ed she has always been heavily focused on calories and weight as long as i can remember for context she is very thin and is a size uk zero to she still often refers to me as the chunky one in the family comments on my legs being thick and wobbly she mentions often that she would like me to have children so that my belly can become big and saggy like many teenagers that grew up in the late s and early i struggled with my body image i would do anything to be thin i moved out early and still to this day have never received a phone call from her i make all the effort to plan things when we do talk or see one another she doesnt ask me anything about my life show any interest when i try to she will start talking about herself or change the topic entirely when we are in a group and i start talking she talks over me and ended up spending the majority of my s in an unhappy and in a abusive relationship i never felt anything good about myself i thought of myself as nothing my mental and physical health was the worst its ever been i was experiencing many of the side effects of having an ed i confided in my mother about what my ex partner was putting me through she convinced me to stay in that relationship dispute later telling me she hated my ex partner she is never able to offer me any worthwhile advice always blaming the problems in my life on my own actions the police where called by a neighbour after a paticularly violent incident and i was set free years of living in fear pain and violence all gone away the chance of a better life for myself although unaware of it at the time i was still suffering the effects of believing that everything that happened to me was my own fault i spent weeks of having crippling panic attacks eventually i learned to relive again i started secretly chatting and eventually dating to my long term crush i moved into my own bedsit i realised that they are a truly beautiful person they helped repair some of the damage caused we moved together fell in love and got engaged they taught me a passion for life and how to enjoy everything including food my body became healthy i realised what having that feels like i still struggle with body image and dismorphia i have a good support system in place i have been seen by a doctor who put me in a lower end but healthy bmi again just for context i am a uk size and ft she was heavily critical of every decision that i made while planning my wedding and was extremely negative i took my mother wedding dress shopping and she was unable to say anything good i choose the one according to my mother that didnt make me look big or fat she purchased a white wedding dress to wear to my wedding when i mentioned i was hurt by this she went on a tangent saying that i only want her to look horrible she didnt wear the dress due to the support of my family after i explained the suitation they politely explained that the dress just doesnt suit her we got married recently after a year of planning it was everything that i dreamed of i struggled with trying not to starve myself but managed to stay on track knowing that alterations are expensive and my dress fit well the day before the wedding we went out for a big family meal the only topic of conversation from her was about my husband looking nervous and regretting his decision to marry me she keep whispering in my ear things along the lines of he wont turn up the morning of my wedding i tried so hard to ignore the comments that she was making she did her best to job distract the hair and mua to prevent them from being able to focus on me i asked her to help me put on my dress and this i regret deeply she made a big issue of not being able to do it up she spent minutes commenting that i had put on loads of weight despite me being aware that my weight is exactly the same as when i tried it on when i mentioned this she tutted and asked you think so do you unfortunately after comment and negative criticism it did take its toll tried my best to put myself into the headspace of not thinking about my body and more on my beautiful husband when i was fully dressed for my wedding and ready to go i never got any positive comments from my mother she swore and shouted at me in front of all my closest freinds and family just before i was about to walk down the isle seeing my husbands happiness at the end of it made it better when the photographer was around it was hard not to think about how fat i would look in the photos being taken i felt unable to relax dispute the negative impact of my mother i did have a beautiful wedding and an amazing time but i cant look at the photos of myself and feel attractive i understand that a wedding is about marriage and me and my partner have a wonderful relationship where we have open communication i informed the wedding party about her behaviour and they where shocked from now on i believe the best way to live my life is to focus on my marriage i have brought up her behaviour in the past but as you can imagine it hasnt gone down well and its always been my fault i spoke about her behaviour to my stepdad who simply put it down to my mother having verbal diarrhea he explained that she is unaware of her words and the way they make others feel i wouldnt describe my mother as happy in her appearance in fact its quite the opposite i always thought that narcissists belive that the are greatest best and most beautiful amazing people ever however i dont know why else she would behave like this i heard of grey rock syndrome she also has strong emotions and the ability to feel things she appears to lack something however could it be that she is emotionally immature i would like to know so i can understand it better dispute everything i love my mother its difficult and complicated i have come to accept that she cannot listen and doesnt understand the impact of her words

when i was my dad broke the law and had to leave home this left me with my mum and things were calm for a while eventually he saw us more and more frequently then when i was he moved in again to our new house my mum and dad would argue more and more over the next few years until they would scream at each other for hours most days doors slammed broken plates road rage my dad would never halm anyone physically but he certainly would emotionally dont get me wrong my mum wasnt perfect either but at least when i looked through one of our bookshelves i found self help books with her notes in them also whenever i had an issue i would go to my mum and she would help and support me me and my dad however were never that close and i wouldnt even hug him then when i was on friday th march the beginning of covid my mum passed away due to an aneurysm the house felt eerily quiet and empty without her and after that i would never be the same the whole world was falling apart i wasnt going to school and id just lost the one person i cared about most my own mum after that me my brother and my dad would hardly discuss the situation and instead just carry on as if nothing happened over the next few years it would become more and more apparent to me that my dad had major anger issues was emotionally absent and even controlling he would call me names criticise me yell not communicate whatsoever and not try to change even when i made an effort to calmly tell him how he affected me he even told me he was normal and every parent was like him if i didnt do what he said hed get really mad and simply give up trying he gave up dealing with us a lot he hates solving issues my dad doesnt even enjoy having normal conversations with me or anyone for that matter but especially me when i try to talk to him for more than minutes he will barely respond tell me what im saying is a stream of consciousness aka boring or that im making him think too much i understand that hes not that social but it feels like even short conversations bother him from his own children all of these issues with him and the rest of my family have caused me long term trauma and i feel like i cant make any friends because no one likes me if he cant have constructive conversations with me i seriously feel bad for my mum too so in conclusion i dont know what to do because he has anger issues cannot communicate and doesnt want to change by the way before anyone says it yes i know hes got to work and does a lot of the chores etc but id rather be in a family where i have to do that myself and i feel actually cared for than one which is the other way around

my mom said that my dad can see my activity such as when im on my phone and what apps im on this has caused me so much anxiety as i have tiktok and reddit which im not supposed to have they havent said anything about that yet im also a teenager doing teenager stuff would prefer if my parents could not see everything on my phone i dont have a great relationship with them and hate them knowing things about me in general a quick google search and i found things like if you phone battery dies quickly or your phone lags or freezes a lot it could mean theres a tracking app installed both of these things seem to apply to my phone and im honestly really scared of them being able to see what im doing and when im on my phone ive looked through my settings and my ipod is under family there which is under my moms email i blocked it after that but didnt find anything else im not techy at all so i have no clue what to look for and where to look ive googled this to no avail i have tried telling her that i dont like being monitored and that its an invasion of privacy but she wont listen please help im sorry if this is the wrong place my parents are emotionally and somewhat physically abusive and i dont know where else to go
throwaway account ish i dont know i dont regularly use reddit i just troll tldr a ramble i f feel like im at the end of the rope with my parents im so exhausted and overwhelmed constantly i usually scroll through this group trying to downplay my parents and trick myself into thinking that im fine and everythings fine my parents do not get along with each other at all theyre the stereotypical parents that should be divorced but likely never will my mom is a narcissist and possibly bipolar she tried therapy for a few years but then decided that therapy was a bad thing it wouldnt matter anyway she just spins her web around the therapist and makes herself out to be the victim in every situation my dad is an alcoholic likely from having to put up with my mom for years he can get somewhat physically abusive at times but he constantly shouts gets into fights with my mom etc ive had things like glass phones anything within reach thrown at my head ive been choked i feel like they argue constantly when theyre not arguing they like to gang up on me my dad always agrees with my moms opinions if hes not mad at her and they both constantly berate me i feel like they hate me she always talks about life before me and how life would be without me my mom constantly threatens to kill my animals in a joking manner i think she loathes me over the animals that she bought for me her new tagline is that shell clear out my bank account unfortunately she has access to it entirely ive been working since i was young from under the table to official jobs surprisingly family therapy was tried i dont think it did anything i was almost mute the entire time because what was i going to say my parents just whined that i spent too much time in my room a few days before that meeting i was grounded for staying in my bedroom while they were screaming at each other i think my moms favorite pastime is to take things away from me and see how much i care i bought my phone and pay for cellular but she constantly takes it away from me and grounds me from it when she cant have the phone she will just shut off the internet to spite everyone on the outside she wants to maintain a perfect public image for her friends and the church i have high grades and an even higher gpa due to the amount of college courses she enrolled me in while still in highschool supposedly shes paying for my college too lately i feel like my thick skin has been stripped and i am left with no protection against their words and actions i stood my ground for so long and i feel like it has shattered my mind is going dark places and i just need to make it pass my college years before i can breathe
when i was growing up and especially when i was little i idolized my father i thought he was a great role model and his presence made me happy when i was a teen we would occasionally get into arguments sometimes more severe and sometimes less but i still respected him and enjoyed his company overall these arguments were always verbal never physical except on one memorable occasion when he shoved me i wouldnt say these arguments were out of the ordinary for what i think goes on in most families and my father in many ways was a very good dad when i was growing up he was generous usually pleasant and easygoing he provided me and my brother with everything we ever needed supported us in all our endeavors and i related to him a lot as i felt many of our interests were similar we share the same birthday and he has often expressed to me that i was the best birthday present he ever received over my almost m young adult life my perception of my father has changed drastically as i have recently observed a number of verbally abusive behaviors from him towards me my brother and my mom while is possible that he has always acted this way to some degree and i just didnt notice it as a child i think he has gotten much worse over the years and my brother agrees i dont remember him acting this way when i was a kid when he gets angry he does these things he yells at all of us he curses he is passive aggressive or sometimes very directly aggressive he says things that are mean or derogatory i remember him calling me sensitive in a derogatory way in an argument last year things first got bad about years ago when he had a fight with my mom about a bag of fruit that she threw out not joking he had picked the fruit from the yard himself a couple days prior but the fruit was starting to get old and soft i wouldnt have eaten it at that point when he noticed it in the trash he fished it out tossed it at my mom and called her a b that was the straw that broke the camels back things had been pretty pleasant and normal before then not exactly as things were when i was a kid but similar but after that i was deeply shaken i should note that my mom does yell in arguments too and says some things back at my dad when they are arguing but she is never abusive like that now since then there have been a number of arguments between me and my dad we have talked these through and each time he apologizes but it seems to me like he is always making excuses to go along with the apology or at least thats how i see it he says hes just telling me his own perspective and explaining what happened and why and i usually take those as excuses but i wonder if im judging him too harshly and theyre not really excuses because isnt it fair to give someone your perspective or explain what happened after an argument anyway things have felt a little teetertotter since then ill often have a visit or two where everything is fine hes the same generous loving father i remember there are no arguments hes happy to see me he hugs me calls me buddy we do fun activities together he treats me to lunch etc and i feel like the relationship is healing but then the next visit we get into another argument and i lose a little more respect for him and i feel so awful so fast forward to today my dad and my mom moved this weekend and my brother and i went to help them with the move well last night a couple hours after arriving to their new home we got into another argument the house was very warm when we arrived and we switched on the ac immediately but after several hours as it neared bedtime it was still pretty warm in the bedroom and i was worried that i wasnt going to be able to sleep well so i expressed my concern repeatedly that was probably annoying i was just anxious because i really needed a good nights sleep then i walked around the house trying to make sure the vents were all open etc and found that my dad had left a window open while they were gone despite it being degrees outside and they hadnt closed them since arriving i came out and said maybe it would be cooler if my dad hadnt left the window open honest to goodness i wasnt trying to incite anything i was just annoyed and that is when it happened my dad said f you to me went into his own room and shut the door i didnt see him for the rest of the night i was deeply hurt i take responsibility for my own comment i probably shouldnt havedidnt need to say that but his reaction was so unwarranted for context i am a pretty calm and relaxed person the vast majority of the time this is not just my own perception everyone i know says this about me they consider my calmness one of my defining traits perhaps because of my innate nature or perhaps as a reaction to the very strong personalities in my family i have made a conscious effort in my life to process my emotions in healthy productive ways including my anger i never yell at my friends and especially never at my partner the cycle ends with me unfortunately however i find that i do yell at my parents and my brother i have found it difficult to change with them as they are so explosive aside from those three i find it is easy to maintain my composure and refrain from yelling so this morning he gave me a somewhat weak apology the same deal as many other arguments he said he was sorry and then started trying to explain what happened i said he was making excuses he started yelling at me and i yelled back i yelled at him that cursing his own son out like that was abusive and that i would not accept it he claimed that i was provoking him and doing things to push his buttons i said that was not my intention and all i wanted to hear from him was that what he said was wrong and that he wouldnt do it again after all i probably shouldnt have said what i said but what he said was much worse he said i had to acknowledge that i was pushing his buttons and inciting things and that his feelings were valid too i certainly would have acknowledged that in different circumstances but because of the context i saw that as more excuses and avoiding a real apology so i told him i had nothing left to say now we havent spoken more than a few words in a few hours so reddit i understand that i need to process this on my own terms and the way i see fit maybe i need some therapy but just as a gut reaction what do you all you folks out there think of this what would be an appropriate course of action is this able to be resolved should i apologize to him for pushing his buttons what do you think is the best path forward i dont want to react too extremely i do still love my dad and i dont want him out of my life that being said every time we have one of these arguments it is slowly but surely tarnishing a family relationship that ive known and cherished my whole life thanks in advance for your responses
hi so recently im a bit confused regarding an incident so to give context its regarding my mother who i believe isnt completely emotionally normal i would not go into the details as i have already in another post so it doesnt matter the thing is that a few months back i remembered an incident of when i was around or i guess my mother getting an episode or something as usual and she went to the kitchen threatening to kill herself idr exactly but i think i went inside ig and then she held my hand and tried doing it to me as well i somehow managed to get out of the situation but i remember she said something while holding my hand like yeah you come along with me as well idr exactly tho also this wasnt the first time she tried harming herself the second or third time ig theonly difference was she tried doing it to me as well this time but i dont get it why after all these years have a randomly out of nowhere recalled such stuff and its kinda bothering me now not alot just a bit also after all these years i feel like i am making all this up and it is in my mind like a bad dream or something idk what it is actually also as a kid i believed all this stuff was normal until i realised maybe not anyways have a good day thank you
ive never thought my dad was doing anything wrong i always thought it was very normal but the more other people vent to me about their abuse the more im starting to belive it might be but at the same time i feel like abuse is too strong of a word for it esp since i have friends who have experienced way way worse than this its not very severe or anything he has never hit or punched or kicked me but he has repeatedly throughout my childhood told me and threatened about how he can break all the bones in my body if he wanted to often while tightly gripping my wrist to prove a point i think he gripped it so it hurt on purpose he knew well it hurt and i told him it hurt and tried telling him to let me go and he didnt i didnt get a diagnosis of asd until june this year but he also grabbed my face to make me make eyecontact with him even though i am autistic and ive never been able to make eyecontact i hate it ive always hated it and now im always conflicted between looking at peoples eyes or not because it makes me really uncomfortable i dont like it at all but i feel like i have to and it stresses me out a lot he has also multiple times pushed me around when ive had an pretty obvious autistic shutdown but again he didnt know it was autism at the time whenever i tried to speak against him even when he wasnt mad and when he was mad he has spoken above me and interrupted me and often ended up screaming at me even if its just something normal topic he multiple times held me down on the floor to make me listen to him and not leave shaking my body rough this only happened once but when me and my brother shared one room my brother talked to me a lot and i told him to go to bed and my dad got angry and stormed in and pulled me down from my bed down on the floor so my body got scraped and bruised our beds are build on the walls so they are pretty high he is about meters and it is taller than him i didnt write this for pity i just want a straight answer please sorry if my english is bad

so i have an emotional abusive dad i dont really wanna go into the details but basically my parents had a horrible divorce and i was caught in the middle and somehow this awful man was able to get full custody of me probably through lies and manipulation he always would tell me things as a kid as fact like your mother is an abusive monster you dont really have a mother we are two peas in a pod im always there for you im your support system all of these things i realized was a way to isolate me and control me this dawned on me after my dad having a mood swing he always has mood swings where he makes and excuse that it was ok for him to treat me that way because xyz usually in relation to oh well i was in pain or oh i wasent feeling well or oh i was tired he called me bad dog for staying up late keep in mind im and completely able to do as i please as a legal adult and while yes i shouldnt be staying up late my sleep schedule is not the best because my mental health has been all over the place and im struggling with untreated mental health conditions im working to treat hopefully and if youre asking why is a year old still living with their parent im possibly disabled i say possibly because i havent been able to get diagnosed due to no access to medical care until recently and unemployed due to zero job experience and having physical limitations im hoping to get into collage soon but i just needed a break year for my mental health so back to what i was saying hearing my dad call me bag dog brought me back to all the times when i was a kid where when i did anything he didnt like or if i misbehaved or questioned him he would call me bad dog and how dehumanizing it felt i of course didnt know the words for it as a year old but its just shocking to me that he would do stuff like that and then turn around and be like im your only solid support everyone else is supporting you to but im your number one supporter and then belittle every other support i had that didnt fit his rhetoric i just cant wrap my head around why he would do that i mean i get that he wanted to control me but it just creeps me out and made me realize how controlling and possessive my dad really is over me and im just in a bit of shock and idk what to do i really want to get my own apartment and get the fuck away from him but im unable to do so at the moment and its terrifying im scared of him and now anytime he makes a movement im tense and i prepare myself to deal with his bullshit and ive gotten to the point where i cant take it anymore i just idk what to do or what to think id really appreciate some outside perspectives on this also just so its known this is the very tip of the iceberg with how awful and creepy my dad can be this post could be endless if i tryed to cover it all haha i just wanted that to be known cuz idk how this post may seem from the outside but its been a long time coming in my opinion
so my parents were extremely emotionally abusive and ruined my life as a young adult by lying to the entire community about me now im in my s and have gotten injured so much that i am basically completely disabled and i have no where else to turn until i can get disability if that even happens so i may be forced to move back in with them can anyone offer me any motivation or suggestions or anything i am feeling very lost and scared about this step in my life
even though im a woman i wish i couldve had a real dad my lack of a real father figure genuinely bothers me i tf am a woman not a man ive been transitioned for a couple years now mtf and no having a weak father is not what made me trans ive had female inclination in my brain structure since i was like in kindergarten and no no one touched me either despite the fact that i am a woman i still spent years being socialized trying my best to be and being perceived as a man i used to look up to my father for his work ethic his honesty and his devotion to my mother i would harrowingly and brutally find out he was actually a liar an adulterer and upon reflection i realized he never really was there for me or my brothers i distinctly remember having to teach myself how to tie a tie before my first job interview using a youtube instructional video everything i learned about fixing cars not that that is an inherently male trait i learned either from my older brother m or from work experience as i used to sell and work with auto parts professionally now the car thing is understandable as i never expressed any interest in working on mechanics or in engineering i was always more into philosophy history art fashion political science nerd stuff like comics and books and cartoons things of that nature which are not gender specific things btw i learned how to fight which toxic as some may think is a genuine important part of being a man unfortunately from again having brothers having friends who studied mma and from dangerous street fights this last one sounds cool but was not i had to go through alot of therapy to undo some damage done to me from having these too young he taught me how to throw a ball i guess and i even was on a baseball team for a season as a kid and we were second in our division otherwise known as the team that lost to the team that would go on to state sports i always had a passive appreciation of and i did enjoy the experience but tbh sports were also not my forte now i have a cellular disease known as mitochondrial disease so i also spent alot of time in and out of a wheelchair as a kid i would get substantially healthier as a teen but i never had any genuine instruction from my father on manhood hell my brother gave me the talk before my dad did one thing i always respected about him though was his morals he would espouse to believe in the fact he worked alot and that when i had my first girlfriend he didnt objectify the concept he said just be sure to treat her like a proper lady and now im gay as a woman i mean transbian is what the term is which was one of the reasons i struggled to realize i was trans but again when push came to shove i realized post transition he wasnt really honest i knew it wouldve been a stretch to get him on board with my transition as hes a devout religious conservative however believe it or not im still a christian myself obviously more progressive in doctrinal understanding but i would end up going to seminary and getting several study certificates i am also now a legally ordained non denominational christian minister and currently study christian topics at yale online gearing up for a big showdown of theology when i first came out i was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find he said well i accept you umm are you a christian still not to be rude are you a full bore woman now asking if i had the surgery or not and i answered accurately not that its anyones business but i have not had any operations no at the time was true and i still believe in jesus yes some remarks here and there would be not fully pc but i would tolerate in patience he invited me to study the bible with him a chance i jumped on as im sure its obvious from my disclosure that im a minister but theology and biblical study are a shared special interest of him and i so i thought he was being genuine and naively let my gaurd down now he did this thing whilst we studied where he would accidently misgender me and or deadname me i would always just very politely correct him he would say sorry and then seemingly get better and try however there was a pattern he would do the exact same process of slipping in my deadname and old gender and i am not stupid so i asked him one day dad you dont think this bible study is going to magically make me detransition right and halfway still believing optimistically that i was maybe imagining the pattern i was promptly disapointed and honestly heartshattered when he said well i cant confirm or deny that i want what god wants son i held my wits and emotions together and corrected him again it would be daughter not son and i honestly dont think we should continue with the study i thought you wanted to reconnect and admit it or not you had other motives he apologized and simply said well the offer still stands barely acknowledging what he was trying to do i had gone on with an optimistic hope but a now validated reserved approach to my dad for further context if you are wondering my mother passed it was the spark that made me fully realize i needed to transition and mind you myself and my partner at the time paid for her funeral i waited until she was cremated and memorialized before coming out to the rest of my family i even gave them all one last christmas with the old me and as fate would have it the year i came out was the year the cincinnati bengals would go to the super bowl the bengals are my dads favorite football team i went with him when neither of my brothers would to his little sports bar he began hanging out in and i gave him that shared experience to watch his team with his son i didnt say anything but in my head that was my old selfs personal goodbye to him as a fatherson dynamic despite these things my father didnt care a following sunday the church he attends will elaborate on why its in quotations later after the bible study attack had failed to convert me back to normal i tuned in to his church livestreams because a i wanted to know what they were preaching and b i still wanted some connection to him to my horror the pastor dropped my deadname and demanded the congregation pray for his salvation in reference to me that was at the time the final straw and i texted my father a long respectful but stern letter explaining i was going to be no contact with him for awhile now as fate would have it my partner at the time would turn abusive at one point even brutally beating me i have documentation of this i was homeless and the only place left would end up being his property i had explained to him that the only thing i would need of him would be to respect my pronouns and name which btw is my birth name because i was a man they all pronounced it different but my mother always intended for it to be pronounced how i pronounce it now anyways i only legally changed my dead middle name to ann after my grandma as my dead middle name was after my grandpa so all in all not even hard to do long story short he would kick me out and i was on my own completely in this time frame i had become ordained and received seminary training in a scathing falling out argument we had i had given him several resources about lgbtq stuff in order to help him understand i was incredibly patient he one day retorted all of my efforts with a simple well none of those studies are christian specific so i dont care about them so i as a christian took up the challenge i gave him articles written by affirming modern day reformation leaders books written by affirming protestant reverends youtube channels ran by affirming pastors and even my own tidbits i had discovered about translation after receiving my art of biblical words certification i would find out later he never even opened any of them he was set in his way for no reason i remember one line even if they dont specifically condemn it they do in fact not explicitly affirm it either so ill never accept it he said a plethora of really disgusting things to me as well in regards to my transness and he seemed angry that i thought i could somehow call myself a christian during my time being homeless again i would whilst doing independent denominational research browse my dads church which i was partially raised in into my denominational searching methods to discover they are a prosperity gospel heretical finacial scamming controlling cult which is heavilly documented and even was attached to a deadly trucking attack in australia and was covered by both abc news and minutes i am eternally grateful that i was not baptized in them i later would become consecrated to the lord via being publicly baptized in an elca lutheran church and i have undergone extensive therapy to undo the damage the cult rhetoric did to my psyche so anyways i would find out from my younger brother m that my father had cheated on our mother while she was alive paired with him lying about ever honestly interacting with my research i freely labored for to share with him my entire image of him is shattered and now those other things i mentioned are glaringly more obvious he never taught me how to be a man i am not a man and again him being a poor excuse of a father is not at all why i transitioned i literally am medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria but i still am deeply hurt and saddened by the fact my dad is a truly horrid parent other things that would come to light would be the beatings i used to remember as well deserved discipline were actually all child abuse and often were being done because we broke rules that were arbitrarily given based on his belief that similar to the cult otherwise completely harmless items content or media were somehow witchcraft or demonically possessed certain things he thought as such about were the dark knight batman movie as the cult had a theory that heather ledger was possessed by a joker spirit demon and thats why he sadly overdosed any non critical mention of any apocryphal texts which again i freely acknowledge as non canon as a protestant myself the tv show modern family as it encouraged queers as lgbtq folks are another topic the cult is insanely hateful of i remember that until highschool i wasnt even allowed to call halloween halloween my older brother had to beg to allow myself and my younger brother a chance to celebrate it and he did as such by having to write a report on the true orgins of halloween to my horror after my dear mother passed he has gone unchallenged as she used to often push back on him he now doesnt even watch tv news he only consumes cult approved content christian youtubers a subject i actually also consume sports and bible readings he rejects anything that counteracts the cult specific interpretations of scripture he told my little brother he was never going to see his mother again and that jesus told him he was evil the damage of being raised by such a man is still present
when i was and younger my dad would frequently beat me upkick me out of the houseimpose his religious muslim rules on mecurse me out now im and since we dont interact much he only keeps it to the verbal abuse always telling me how im not worth anything and im a good for nothing daughter it really hurts me when i see other girls my age have such kind and caring fathers i feel like he has shattered my confidence so deeply that im a shell of a person i always wondered how many others girls my age had fathers who would punch them or backhand them for minor inconveniences at the age of sometimes i find myself wishing that he dies so i can finally be at peace and not afraid of him im going to be a junior this year and i wanted to apply to really good colleges but because of him i fell into such severe depression that now im a pretty average student with no extracurriculars i cant get a part time job right now because of my visa status so i have to rely on him for money i really want my life to get better does anyone know what to do
the more i look back at my childhood the more i come to hate my dad like hes already an asshole in the present but looking back to when i was like just makes me realize how fucked up things around me were it all started after my parents divorced my only memories of him during that time was when hed take to places like gas stations at pmamish which i was definitely to young for id go with him cause i was just a kid who wanted to spend time with her dad anyways hed leave me alone in the car while he ran into the store to get whatever and during the car ride hed just vent to me about how my mom apparently did him wrong during the divorce and of course it was all her fault he can never take accountability for anything since i was a naive kid i took his word and it ended up as anger and resentment towards my mom even if my mom tried to give her side hed call her a liar and blah blah blah its also just a bunch of small things that add up over time like him constantly being asleep or out whenever i needed him for something or him just usingtaking things without my permission for example i used to keep a jar a coins for when wed play card games that involved small bets one day i get over to his house to find out hes taken all of the coins outta the jar to buy cigars he gave me in return but i really didnt care about how much money he took it was one of the last straws of my already decreasing trust ya know im told that i should be lucky to still have my dad in my life but he hasnt been an actual father figure in years i find myself wishing i could cut him out of my life but im still a couple years short before i turn and can leave on my own
i decided over year ago to go no contact with my father as he was abusive during my childhood i knew doing this there was a very likely chance he wouldnt try to repare the relationship and just go along with the no contact since this he has gotten engaged and i was a little surprised that he didnt try contact me to inform me today my grandma ran into him and was talking to him and he didnt ask her how me or my sister were i feel unwanted even though i was the one to initiate the no contact
so im f am the youngest girl of kids girls boys i live with my youngest brother m and my dad m for context most of my siblings have different moms beside me and my brother m our mom has lived in new york for the past and a half years weve been raised by our dad in texas my brother has a job but has only had it for a year and before that he did nothing he finish high school at and took a year off after im going into my sophomore year in a couple weeks my dad never gets mad or upset at my brother i think its mostly because they look a lot alike and hes the only boy my dad raised so its kinda like his only son i look like my mother and my father hates her i get yelled at or stuff i didnt even do ive have been hit a couple times but rarely and its mostly just stuff like him saying hes gonna send me to my mom and that i act just like her he knows i dont like being compared to my mother yet he does it anyways i know its not a lot but hes been doing it for years and i just want to know is it abuse

hello who ever sees this message will be the first person besides my husbandive ever told about this hell that ive endured the last years ive been on this earth i f came from a pretty shitty household my father who is very abusive and an addict and my mother who has become abusive and a recovering drug addict but newly alcoholic i was saed by my father from my earliest memory in diapers to about years old i had gotten too old for my fathers perverted fantasy my earliest memory being physically abused i was about three years old i was thrown down a flight of stairs and whipped continuously with a wet towel until my mother stepped in and then she was the target of his aggression since my mother was so afraid of him she wouldnt call the police for years i had been throw against walls choke slammed pinched verbally abused sexually exploited the list could go on and on i met my husband m the summer before middle school from my cousin i would go over to his house almost everyday just to get away from the abuse i had his mother take me to get on birth control because even though i didnt know much i knew i couldnt bring a child into this living hell fast forward to the day after i turned i had came home from my husbands house my father already aggravated started on me telling me that i was selfish for letting my husband have me all to himself calling me a whore fat worthless you name it that day i decided i wasnt afraid of him anymore i defended myself and he couldnt stand that i didnt fear him anymore he grabbed me by my hair and throat and slammed me on to the wooden floor i grabbed whatever i could and bashed him in the face after he got off me i started packing all my belongings we had came to the agreement that if i never told about him sa me or the abuse that he would let me leave i felt terrible for leaving my mother but i knew that if i didnt leave that i would die i moved in with my husband and his family graduated high school got a great job bought a car and then eventually we bought a house together now we are married we have a son and i have been no contact with my father for months now if you are in a situation like this now this is proof that you will make it things get better lmk if yall want a part two about my mother
after years of trying to communicate the harm theyve done to me ive finally given up i dont feel any sense of remorse or regret or shame in fact i feel nothing i just blocked them and moved about my day i dont think they fully understand that i dont consider them or think about them ive removed them so much from my life that severing the only line of communication we had was all that i had to do i sometimes wish it would have been different i would have liked to have parents who loved and respected me but they cant change theyre so hellbent on denying the abuse so determined to pretend none of it happened theyre so pathetic really then again seeing what raised them i shouldnt be too surprised the apple really doesnt fall far from the tree their loss though i have a partner who loves me and friends who love me im happy where im at i dont need anything from them cest la vie
f i dont want to live with my family anymore and i dont know whether i should leave or not for as long as i can remember there has been yelling all the time and i dont feel safe living with them but i also feel guilty if i leave an organisation offered to give me a place to live should i wait more years to legally move out without causing drama in my family or move out now
my dad genuinely is not capable of having feelings empathy or sympathy for starters but our whole relationship im f and hes m is so surface level and transactional for example im in az where its degrees outside and my power went out my dad said i could come over until it came back on only if i brought him a cheeseburger then i said no and he said then dont come or he will only do something for me if i do something for him he will only pick me up milk from the store if i clean his house or truck nothing is ever just a nice gesture for me hes my dad so i would clean his house if he needed me too anyways for nothing in return but its always a catch with him if he ever offers to do something later on in life he will hold it against you like well i did this for you so now you need to do this for me or pay me back somehow just so irritating how people cant do things out of goodness in their hearts anymore
tw so im trying to figure out if what i experienced within my family was sexual abuse for context my mom was a stripper all throughout my childhood her father ran and managed most of the clubs she worked at not all but enough when i was a child and teen i remember my mom being naked most of the time she was under a blanket but it was apparent she was nude once when she was drunk and had hurt herself she needed my help to get into bed she had taken all her clothes off and then sneered at me and told me not to look at her and called me a pervert i wasnt looked by the way i was just trying to help my drunk naked mom into bed at there were times when she would make comments about my developing breasts and poke them and laugh and giggle despite me expressing i didnt like it it felt like she was trying to embarrass me there was also at least one occasion where she barged into the bathroom and took a photo of me naked as i was getting into the shower and again laughed and joked about it and had that photo developed her and my grandfather also would make inappropriate sexual jokes and comments not together or at each other just in general also less conspicuous i guess but she would lick and suck on my step dads tongue in front of us and then laugh when i was grossed out by it my grandfather would make the worst and most sexual comments and talk about bending women over and making grunting sexual noises he would also talk about how frequently him and his wife had sex and things like that all of this was just so normal that even now in my s im just starting to question these things and figure out how to define them i truly dont think my mom at least got any sexual gratification from these things it was more to humiliate and embarrass me and she was incredibly immature in a lot of ways so it feels very gray to me
so i have been sick all day today with light fever and a cold and a shit load of body ache my mom was out at the parlor all day and asked me to go get my little sister from school even tho im sick btw she didnt know cause she didnt bother to ask duh i ask her to make me a drink to make me feel better ans so she does when she comes in my room she screams at me and threatens to throw the boiling hot drink on me and guess why cause my lights are not turned on properly therefore im not studying my head hurts and so i kept the lights down low and have been doing maths for the last hours even tho i dont feel good we argue for a bit and once she leaves i start crying now i have a major headache and my eye hurts more and i didnt want to bother my friend so im writing this may i remind you i turned weeks ago
my father single parent has raised me all his life my mother was never in the picture all my life he has been controlling me and telling me how to live my life not to mention the physical and mental abuse he has inflicted on me when i was a child my father is an alcoholic for years now and his entire brain is wired differently hes not capable to see someone elses point or understanding i am f and i still live with him there is some type of codependency between us he always told me how he wants me to dress how he wants me to wear my hair what kind of man i should marry in the future and how i should name my children i am aware that he is probably a narcissist or some of the sort because if i dont end up marrying the kind of man he chooses for me he will be heartbroken he has a victim complex and doesnt respect my feelings or my thoughts i have tried to communicate alot of it with him i have tried to explain to him that i am my own person and that me cutting my hair doesnt make me a bad daughter just because he doesnt like it but he never listens ive repeated myself multiple times but theres no use to it i dont have any siblings so moving out is not an option for me currently my father is very depressed and doesnt see a reason to keep on living except me i dont know what to do he is the reason why i go to therapy and have so many mental issues but he is also my best friend i wish i could just hate him but all i feel for him is pity and alot of guilt if i think of leaving him all alone on his own
just a rant a few days ago i was sent to my grandmothers apartment in new york to watch her after eye surgery since my uncle usually gets off work at late times and is unable to care for her to his full capacity i was hesitant at first but after a few days of staying here i felt so free my parents two ivy league students have been very pushy about this college application process even though i know i dont have the grades or skills to get into any of their dream schools for me i dont know where im going with this but this whole trip just gave me so many opportunities to do teenage things i was finally able to call my boyfriend and friends not hear my parents screaming and cursing at one another and i didnt have to deal with my dad yelling and threatening me it felt so nice maybe im not a victim of anything maybe im just over exaggerating and begging for attention but when my mom came over to take me back home my body went hot and i completely lost it i literally feel like im going to pass out i cant go back i dont want to but i realized that if i dont my dad would lose it and hed argue with my mom or call me just to berate me even more i wish i had someone to talk to i wish i could tell my boyfriend i wish highschool was over so id never have to see my dad again i wish i didnt have to accept the reality of this situation and just say im not going and run away from all my problems too bad i cant lol
im crying in my room right now after being yelled at through the wall i have ibs and been having a flare up for days now i had diarrhea all day long and multiple stomach cramps making it more comfortable for me to lay in bed and distract myself from being on my laptop as well as doing school work online he has ibs himself so it is not like hes uneducated it began when i was sitting in my room listening to johnnie guilbert songs when i heard him call out saying i need to walk the dogs he knew i was having a rough day w pain and diarrhea however he still asked when i said i couldnt be because i had diarrhea and pain meaning i couldnt risk having a bad accident i could hear him yelling for fuck sake fine them me and ur mom will walk them roughly i can remember nowi know i sound like a brat but hear me out he was yelling it aggressively not like a ok well walk them hes been guilt tripping me and my mom for years i feel insanely uncomfortable around him since when he would get mad and begin screaming which i would end up sobbing if i began sobbing he would get even more mad m friends say i have massive father issues but i think im being dramatic since abuse is physical as if my mental health was crap to begin with
hi ive been dealing with guilt and grief because i leave in months i love my family but they are so abusive theyve been acting super nice and sweet because i think they know im about to be but as soon as they get reassurance they have me locked down i know theyll be back to it just like they do my brother ive been planning leaving since may i have an entire plan but im getting the anxiety and guilt here and there i want to be free so badly but i still have guilt and grief about it because i dont want to hurt them despite all theyve dont to me help
i read a quote that said having an abusive parent that breaks their back to provide for you is so tumultuous like how can i hate you when you built a life for me from dust but also how can i not when youve hurt me so badly and it stuck with me you are ungrateful if you leave but cry everyday because home doesnt feel like home at all you are unhappy then you are unhappy now idk how to deal with this because people tell you that you are exaggerating because all your needs are getting fulfilled but but what about the constant comparison with my older sister what about the backhanded comments what about the insult in front of others and what about no freedom and making every important decision for me the idea of death feels more alive
for context my cousin is and im for as long as i remember when visiting my cousin and family she and her sisters were always yelled and always hit by their mother the oldest of the three is getting the brunt of it whether she did anything or not her mother yells and hits her its been getting worse as she gets older with her mother breaking her nose stepping on her head and causing her face to get scratched it got so bad time that her younger sister got involved in a very bad fight that her heart stopped and the ambulance had to be called to get her heart moving again recently my cousin broke up with her idiot cheating boyfriend and her mom is trying to get the two of them back together i dont know why her mom is so persistent with her to be with this guy in her eyes because he doesnt do drugs smokes gambles comes from rich family etc that she should give this cheating scumbag a second chance its gotten to the point that she is constantly calling her following her and not allowing her to hang out with her friends go to her friends wedding and so on and so forth complete isolation bar family my uncle is basically never home due to his job where he is constantly driving and when he gets home he is so exhausted that all he has the energy for is to eat and sleep my grandmother is the one who fiercely protects her like a shield otherwise her mother would do worse things i suggested calling the police however she lives in a country where reputation is extremely important and calling the police would damage the familys reputation severely i suggested getting a job but she said that her mother wouldnt allow it i also suggested for her to stay with our grandparents as they have more than enough space but she said that her mother wouldnt allow it and would hit her and force her to come back home she is so done and she wants to get as far away as possible from her mother she wants to cut contact completely she has no idea how she can escape from her clutches one of her ideas is to get married andor leave the country completely at this point she doesnt know what to do and i have no idea how to help her please help

raise your hand if youve developed an overly simple flavorless writing style because the adults in your life taught you not to waste their time with any interesting elaborate explanations that couldve made your writing more engaging or if youve been slowly killing off your sense of humor after years of hearing it described as your dumb jokes despite the parent loving stuff like snl which exclusively has normal logical humor thats perfectly acceptable for adults to enjoy all because theyre too busy self sabatoging themselves to realize or care how much its hurting your self image
i f am engaged to my fianc m first i just want to say that my fianc is the most wonderful man ive ever met he treats me like a queen i already had kids from my previous relationship when we met and he has taken the role of their father and treats them like his own and now we have a little boy of our own who he is also wonderful with with that being said his mother on the other hand is an honesttogod horrible person so has a twin brother j as well as a younger brother who is about five years younger than the twins ml has always made it perfectly obvious that the youngest child was her favorite going as far as buying him better things than the twins and not punishing him for the same thing that she would punish the twins for since i have known my fiance there has been multiple occasions where his mother has called him up to cuss him out for some of the dumbest reasons one being that he was friends on facebook with his fathers new wife and called him a bad son and a traitor she also told my so that when his father got diagnosed with brain cancer that it was karma for leaving her his father ended up passing about a year later she even went as far as calling him to cuss him out for not wishing his younger brother a happy birthday his mother only speaks spanish and i only speak english so she has never directly said anything to me but pretty much everybody has the same opinion about her and the things she says ive never really liked the woman because of all the things my so told me shes done and said to him but ive always been kind to her for his sake but after this weekend i can honestly say i do not like this woman at all this last weekend was supposed to be a really fun weekend it was me and my fiancs sons first birthday as well as his twin brothers sons first birthday they were born days apart so we were doing a joint birthday party for them ml came into town to celebrate their birthdays together with us but the entire weekend ended up being a shit show and really showed her true colors me and my fiance drove the two hours to j and wifes a house when we got there there was a woman there who ended up being a coworker of js she was in a domestic violence situation and j and a decided to allow her to stay a couple days until she could figure out a new living situation when ml got into town she immediately wanted to go get her nails done j and a took the coworker to the police station to file restraining order as well as get her things from her house in a safe manner this was all last minute and was not planned when ml found out about the woman staying in the house she chewed j and a out and told them that its stupid to let someone stay there and that she was supposed to be there to hang out with them and now she couldnt do that because there was another woman there coworker stayed in the extra room the entire time except to use the bathroom and eat she went on to completely ignore j and a for the rest of the day and most of the next day she ended up calling so and lying and telling him that j and a were the ones ignoring her they offered to take her to the mall as well as a couple other places she refused every single one we also asked about a few places we thought she might enjoy she also said no to those but then got mad that she was just sitting in the house with nothing to do and said instead of asking her we should just plan something and do it a also spent all day making a delicious dinner of ribs corn on the cob and also some mashed potatoes ml tried the food and said that the ribs were too cold and that she didnt like mashed potatoes and was angry that there was no rice available she refused to eat and stomped off to the room she was staying in and locked yourself in there the food was not cold and was delicious by the way me and a ended up taking a drive and she confided in me that she had never been so disrespected in her own home before and was very angry about the situation she broke down crying saying that she wasnt even comfortable being at home because of the way ml was acting it was supposed to be a fun weekend to celebrate ours boys that ended up just turning out horrible we did all end up doing a couple of things but it still wasnt as fun as we imagined it would be in the beginning because everything else had already happened and a especially was super depressed the entire weekend because of how she had been treated by ml i have tried to talk to my fianc about the situation and explain to him how her treatment of him and his brother is wrong he told me that it didnt bother him that he was used to it and that if anything it made him tough because nothing anybody said in life could hurt his feelings because it had already been said by his own mother it broke my heart hearing that because he is the sweetest man ive ever met and he does not deserve to be treated the way him and his brother have been treated their entire life i told him he needed to seek therapy for the treatment by his mother and that she had emotionally abused him but he sees nothing wrong with the way he was treated and doesnt think he needs therapy i just want to know what i can do to get him to seek the help he needs because i feel like someday he is going to end up breaking down and falling apart because of this some of the issues in our own relationship i believe stem from how he was treated by his mother as well and if theres anyone else on here who is getting treated this way just know you are not the problem
for context im f commuting to college and live with my dad to save money my parents lived together since i was and i used to legally have to be at a parents house for certain days of the week until i turned after turning i stopped going to my moms house because it felt a bit uncomfortable there my mom recently got a boyfriend which would be okay to me except his presence bothers me my mother was very verbally physically and arguably emotionally abusive towards me growing up by growing up i mean since i could remember up until now but it has gotten much less severe my dad was not emotionally there for me and he did occasionally yell at me and physically hit me when i was very young but it was only traumatizing to me one time but he was much less emotional as my mom as ive grown up i realized that maybe my parents want to change to be better or theyre not as stressed out enough to let their anger foster that way my dad has been really chill for a while now and im starting to forgive him as hes shown he truly cares and wants whats best for me we have never talked about it but i can sense it my mom is a different case my mom has continued the yelling and the randomly getting angrymean and it genuinely scares me its the only thing that can make me lose control of my emotions and just cry its not full on screaming anymore but its definitely sudden anger and belittling she was not angry at all times during my childhood i loved when she was happy bc she made me feel loved she did not hug me or show me affection but she spent time with me and i enjoyed it to me that was love i know theres probably a woman very broken in her but i cant let go of the constant fear i feel around her its physical fear and its scary i fear that the good mother will go away and i get bad mother that makes me feel so awful i know i am not the best person either when you live with anger issues you get anger issues couple that with religious trauma and discovering my sexuality i could find myself repeating her anger and arguing with those very close to me i am working on myself and getting better and i wasnt nearly as far gone as her i want to forgive her but this is my predicament shes got a new boyfriend that moved in and shes visibly a happier person at least to the eye but shes kind of cut off my grandparents who helped her so much as a single parent after having the stability of having a partner to me it feels a little icky but its not my problem so i feel wrong to foster hatred towards her maybe they hurt her like she hurt me and thats why once she was secure she was done with themi only know this information because my grandparents call me constantly asking me about whats wrong with her and urging me to ask her myself because she has ghosted them this leads me to believe she truly did not grow and she can turn into bad mom real quick especially if the boyfriend is gone they have been together for years now but i am someone that low key does not believe in love ik working on that so my fear is consuming me because im afraid they will eventually break up i dont want to be hurt and disappointed again because every time she showed me kindnessi thought she was turning a new leaf and every time i was met with heartbreak with a boyfriend i now have a measure of when she will go back to bad mom forgot to mention but she also acts mean and belittles me when he is not present but this is only sometimes but not all the time but she has never acted like that in front of him also a fear factor but she has been acting so nice to me and i just know theres someone who is deeply hurt inside of her but i have just been avoidantghosting her subconsciously to protect myself i hate the feeling of guilt and i also want to protect myself any advice anyone else have a similar experience anything would help really
as long as i can remember i feared my father im turning this november and had already planned my whole life eg moving out i have sensory issues and ibs meaning im sick often i can remember him ruining events in my life like the easter bunny i have nearly ran away several times and feel like i want time to pass quickly so i can leavehe has victim blamed multiple times as well as made me sob in my room all night long hell get mad a different reasons and can be explosive
so for context im f i lived with my mom my whole life until months ago i moved into an amazing foster home while i stayed w my mom i got abused alot through these years in all ways an can image my mom were never at home she would work all day bc thats where the money comes and she would often travel for days to meet up with guys while i were left home alone the first time i were only years we also mooved houses about times in years we almost never had food and i would often go hungry i had never experienced having dinner with people and my mom never attend things at school so i would be the only child without parents i had to do all of the chores in a home at a very young age and take care of my siblings as if i were their mother when my mom would come home from work she would often be mad all i can remeber is countless of times where she would hit me choke me and break up the doors if i even tried to lock them through all these years she would tell me things a mother shouldnt tell their child and i thought these things were right and normal list of things my mom repetietly would say no one is ever gonna want you i do not want you i rather wanna die than have you you are misreable you are weak you never make me happy i wish i never birth you these are very hurtful things for a child to hear ecpecially it was for me because growing up and i still am a child who were always quiet and never did anything wrong i never shouted or yelled at anyone
my very young sister is being abused and i need advice on how to move forward i really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and perhaps direct me to a better subreddit give advice on how to deal w this situation please read below as details are important im an adult with an established life who lives mins away from my parents and very young elementary school aged sibling as a child i experienced mostly emotional abuse to a pretty severe extent mostly by my mother there was also multiple instances of physical abuse one instance which left bruise marks on head and arms exclusively done by father he also physically abused my mother i did not have contact with any family members except my parents so there was no adult around to save me i called the police on my father a few times but my mother would vouch for him even tho i had photographs of my bruises so the police never did anything as i grew up my father chilled out and we developed a pretty good relationship while my mother and i continue to have a very bad relationship my father and i have suspicions that my mother has narcissistic personality disorder and i myself have been diagnosed with borderline pd my mothers verbalemotional abuse has gotten worse toward my sibling and she treats my sibling much worse than she ever treated me she does not abuse me anymore i have basically completely cut her off given that my father had stopped abusing me and my mother and i saw growth in him i assumed that he had changed and felt safe leaving my sibling with my parents and moving out to start my own life assuming he would step in the way i did when i lived at home however since ive moved out my sibling has been telling me about increasingly bad instances of abuse including my father physically abusing her once very recently i have no doubt it will only get worse as its following the exact same pattern as it did when i was younger but to a greater degree now shes younger than i was when it started and my mother is much more abusive to her than she was to me its been horrifying seeing the same things that happened to me start happening to her naturally im extremely worried about her and realize that i am literally the only adult able to help her and i dont think i could forgive myself if i didnt at least try to gain custody of her so shes away from these monsters please note ive started gathering evidence asking her to take videos of them yelling at her and have taken vids of her telling me about the physical abuse with her consent unfortunately things arent straightforward as she ultimately still has deep attachments to her parents shes very young and they are very good at brushing their abuse under the rug pretending like its no big deal and having a great day the next day think of an abusive relationship where love bombing follows the abuse then the cycle repeats she doesnt want me to take custody of her even though we have a great relationship and i act as a parental figure to her anyways shes also only a child and certainly unable to understand the ramifications of being abused as a child i also thought it was horrible but didnt understand how much it fucked me up in the long term until i was much older i also am worried about actually having custody as im in school for my doctorate and barely have time to exist asis however of course i would put anything aside to ensure my sibling grows up feeling safe and loved unconditionally lastly i have a semigood relationship with my father hes good when hes not hitting women and children lol and despite how stupid i feel saying this i have a sliver of hope that maybe with therapy and anger management he may be able to improve that side of him i am a bit worried about going through a custody battle and losing the last family i have left him i truly dont know what to do hearing the stories watching the videos my sister takes and knowing this abuse is going on is taking a huge toll on me its like someones tying my hands and forcing me to watch my sister be tortured and fucked up for life shes adamant she doesnt want to separate from her parents but i feel such a responsibility to do something about this im also about to legally be a mandated reporter once i finish my degree for now ive asked her to please not share details with me if she doesnt want my help and to instead just tell me if she needs something physically for me to pick her up for me to make her food and drop it off for her if her mom doesnt feed her out of anger etc but i still feel horrible telling a baby that she shouldnt tell me about the abuse shes experiencing i am getting her a therapist but she cant really talk about the abuse without risking being reported but i also cant hear it and its severely impacting my mental health again im already not doing great given i have borderline personality disorder and was depressed for most of my life not anymore and have had attempts at taking my own life i truly dont know what to do in this situation and am afraid to talk to anyone like a lawyer or therapist as they would likely immediately report thank you so much if you read all the way to the end and please drop any advice you have as ive truly never faced a situation where ive been stumped like this
im going to be a blunt as possible my dad was my abuser and although he isnt in my life anymore and never will be i have a hard time dealing with the fact i feel like i need him to pass before ill get any peace of mind he has a heart condition and is untreated so i find it becoming less and less of a hypothetical everyday but i was hoping for any advice or shared experiences to help navigate the following years or however long is left in his hour glass
whenever i leave or go to work my parents go through my things amd throw out or misplace my things or just yesterday she threw out a bunch of my plants because they were dead they were not the late frost and heatwave had affected growing but if you actually looked at the plant youd see the little green buds when i asked where my things have gone they say i dont know i didnt touch it yet i have video proof of you touching my things i dont say this because then theyll find the camera and break it again like last time i dont fucking know what to do im so stressed all the time i dont want to go home anymore i have panic attacks over coming home and my things have been touched i cant live like this i just come home to shower and sleep now really i hate being stressed all the time
my father is so fucking annoying he wakes up irritated every single day then he makes sure that everyone in the house also has their day ruined this motherfucker deliberately orders me around like a servant it makes him feel as if hes in power he doesnt work all he does is watch youtube videos about health or hate speech and then he acts as if hes the most knowledgeable person in the world this absolute karen literally told a doctor with years of studying and a fucking degree that he doesnt know shit about his work according to asshole dumb narcissist father he has more knowledge than anyone just cuz he watched a few youtube videos on a certain topic dumbass takes my gadgets away then screams and orders me around cuz im a girl he doesnt let me live in peace like never always fucking arguing and screaming telling me that im worthless because im not studying all the time when all he does and has been doing for years is laying on the couch watching tvi cant concentrate on studying fuck that i cant concentrate on anything whenever i try to do something he interrupts and tries to act as if he knows everything and tries to correct me i fucking hate him so much why doesnt he just die because of him my depression is kicking in and im only i need to study to get myself out of her but i cant even do that because hes always hovering over me
hello im making this post becausewell i dont actually know how to explain it because im not that good with english but id like to hear other peoples opinions to sum up a long messy story my mom had a rough childhood in a formerly communist country she was well of but her mom died know childbirth and she blames her stepmom for a bad childhood but ive spoken to grandpa and step grandma and from their stories i personally think she was always a very angry and lazy person there was a whole messy deal when i was born because i was born in her second marriage she was a bit wild in highschool and got pregnant at she was forced to marry and had a divorce she had song in her first marriage my dads side of the family is poorer we live in a village and most views are very close minded though because of dads dad who always blew away money and cheated and from what i heard beat my dead grandma dads mom they had a bad reputation it kinda sticks to you for a while is what im saying she married him and there they all had a deal that theyd raise the sons from her first marriage but mom got pregnant with me and there was this whole messy fight and i kinda grow up with a dad whod get really drunk once in a while though he doesnt get angry often he has these massive explosive fits every once in a while and mom whos from what i belive very emotionally underdeveloped and whould always threaten me and beat me sometimes we get into physical altercations i just dont want her to keep hitting me and now im big enoughto defend myselfwhen i was younger once i started going to highschool i got super paranoid because i was really worried id let loose like her get pregnant and basi stop living mom and her ex had a joint custody she had to pay him the child fee i dont know the correct term sorry and as a result refused to work and now cant have a credit card because she doesnt want to give the ex any money i tried telling her to get a protected account but she doesnt want to let even od her pay to go to him and always starts accusing me of hating and not knowing what im saying her when i try talking to her about it i just think shes a very bitter creature thats kinda mad ive got a semi normal life but maybe im just a bitch my little sister tends to be feisty like her too and very argumentative but i think thats because shes a teen anywaythat was a long intro and i hope someone will read this through but sometimes i fear that im just like my mom and i hate it today while i was packing i got really suspicious to leave for a new job when i couldnt find the envelope with some money i got as a gift and got angry at her maybe i just dont like her but she used to steal the support money that i was getting for my good grades and would steal the tips i got from my part time job i didnt blame her because i put a lot of effort in self control but i was angry and nervous and when some is angry with her shes angrier backso i kinda threw out all the stuff out my suitcase and dug around my whole room somehow the envelope was on the floor even though i put it in the drawer she always says im forgetful in this bitchy tone even though i never misplace things when im at work for example though i am a scatter brain sometimes now she wont talk to me even though i tried to apologize im usually very easy going with others but everything is a fight with her and she just brings out this anger out of me i hate her sreaming do you think im the problem i keep thinking im the one ruining this family and even now as i write this i feel like im lying as i type this out and that im trying to get someone on my side for reference im a girl that just reached yo and im kind of an odd ball well i think this would be the proper translation of the term in my language im unsure what to so with myself dont know shit and dont think i can make it happen i decided to take a job far away to get away from my hometown and family but like idk im afraid that i dont deserve it please tell me what you think because i dont trust my brain at the moment and dont wanna mentally beat myself down but i still think i love them my country is kinda known for being crazy and poor so maybe i should just change my outlook on it or something thanks again and sorry for the grammer i did the best i can
my father is emotionally and physically abusive he would yell threats like ill break you legs or tell me things like he and i are both good at taking advantage and lying to other people using them to get what we want some of the physical stuff he did to me and my siblings like picking me up by my shirt and slamming me against the wall or the time where he punched my little brother in the nose and gave him a nosebleed he is a good kind man who cares i just fear him sometimes he said he didnt have a father so he struggles to be one anyways back to the title i used to have nightmares of my brothers or my sister dying not by my father but just dying i dreamed that i was helpless and i was crying these dreams continued for a while and then they stopped they reappeared at other times as well i think its because as the oldest i am required to protect my siblings these thoughts are physically painfulthese thoughts and other things are weighing on my mind and twisting it every single day you do not want to know the stuff that goes on in my head these days it feels like my mind is getting worse and worse i can go to no one ive become a cold uncaring lier i find it hard to connect and care for people like my own siblings hopefully my parents dont find out about this post they monitor my phone but i have found some loop holes i am m

how bad is my situation compared to someone normal last time i posted about my situation on reddit the title is above here i posted in it about how my father has abused me a lot in the past and i didnt wanted to involve police in the matter but the way he acts is the same i expected a lot but found that he is manipulative angry when i disobey or contradicts him he is not capable of love he always remind me of how he earned money for me i tried to fight against him however i can but i never hit him ever but he always hit me when i disagreed with him and then my family i tried a lot to get him to change but its not possible now i want to involve law enforcements i am done with him i will try to convince my family to report him but some things to note is that he never hit me or anyone since he came to usa my family is scared of him my cousin is friendly towards him i need to get him away from my family once and for all should i call the police will they arrest him without any evidence i will convince my family to tell the truth for once please help me
hi all i came to reddit to rant get clarity as to handle this very very delicate situation ever since i was child i was abused by mother like crazy she would hit me she would throw cuss words at me and even went to the extent to get support from other members for her shitty ass behavior i realized this was toxic and started taking the help that i need but even then i have not been able to get over the trauma couple of years ago i moved out the country but then also she has this control over me if i put a picture with my boyfriend she asked me to take it down i wore a dress that showed cleavage she was after me for months to change my display picture now that i am happy and in a relationship she is unable to digest that i am happy and she doesnt like the guy at all i live with him now and she is trying to find out who i live with through my friends she is really really stressing me out and i am scared the extent she would go to she is someone who cant understand boundaries and needs to prove a point she is narcissist and toxic af she is out and about to destroy the relationships that i have with my friends by trying to get them to snitch on me i am really helpless and dont know what to do she is also someone who says after all i am your mother and gets away with it
im scared but i cant go back now theres a cps report on the way
tw self harm incest child abuse im an adult male and have a lot of intrusive thoughts about harming myself issues with intimacy substance abuse issues and difficulties with functioning that a lot of people chalk up to autism although tests dont show i have autism some kinds of ptsd can be misdiagnosed as autism as a kid i engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with exclusively male peers and tried to talk other boys into selfharming themselves in their genital region which is a recurring intrusive thought for me even today the most suspicious thing is how my father always talked in a very sexuallycharged ways this hypersexualized vibe even showed up when my father told me about the birds and the bees when i was far too young maybe yo or younger i also had not asked about this topic he told me about the birds and the bees in a very graphic way that made me and my mother uncomfortable and continued talking despite my mother chiding him a bit he also told me within this same conversation about a time where he got a girl drunk and stayed sober himself so he could feel her up when she was passed out it is really chilling to me that not only did he think it was appropriate to tell a child about sex in a super graphic way but he also told me about him sexually assaulting somebody my father is also a self admitted porn addict which was very much in my face when i was growing up theres even a picture in my baby photo album of my father clothed looking at porn with me as newborn sleeping on his shoulder my father once talked about his porn watching habits around the dinner table when i was a teenager and when my stepsister got super uncomfortable he laughed off her concerns and kept talking about it another event was when i was around yo my father came home drunk he was a self described alcoholic and talked to me a bit and somehow got to straddling me clothed and bouncing up and down on me in a very weird way that i think i registered as being weird even as a kid my father also openly had a crush on a yo girl on a vacation i was with him on when i was around he would take suggestive pictures of her all the time told the girls father in front of me that he had a crush on her and joked to her face about his crush on her another reason i think some abuse may have happened to me is some of the aforementioned behavior as a kid when i was i talked a male peer into going into a bathroom and touching each others genitalia even weirder was a pattern of behavior where i tried to talk male peers into causing themselves pain in their genitalia the first time was when i was maybe and involved me placing objects on a slide so that it would hit my male peers in the balls i remember referring to this as a peepee torture which is just so deeply alarming for such a young child another time i tried to talk my male peer into putting ice in his swim trunks as well as put his genitalia in a jacuzzi pool jet other solo things i did in this vein were tying things to my genitals and tying the other end to an elevator and closing toys with sharp hinges on my genitals i continue to have a recurring intrusive thought about causing harm to my genitalia this is extremely alarming to me and some part of my difficulty with intimacyextreme performance anxiety you may ask what my mother was doing this whole time and the answer is nothing when i asked her about some of my inappropriate behavior as a child weird thing to ask my mother but i couldnt find effective therapy and was doing really badly and she blurted out that it was normal and told me a terrifying story about an unnamed male child engaging in incest with his sleeping unknowing sister she told me the sex act the brother did to his sister too telling me this horrifying story with the subtext of all kids do weird things this story also reveals that my mom doesnt really think that abuse is a big deal its just a weird quirky thing what do you think of this does it sounds like something may have happened or are my concerns explained some other way
ok so my relationship is not good with my mother she was never there and has done some stuff which ill not elaborate rn cause thats not the topic of discussion rn ik she has hurt me and the childhood me in many ways and i recently decided to distance myself from her but im thinking does forgiveness help i mean idk i know as a fact that i have no energy in my heart left to go back and fix stuff like literally i cant do that to myself anymore so idk can someone just tell me more about forgiveness and healing a relationship
is it normal for my mom to hittell my year old sisters to shut up and she has an extremely short temper and she also stuffs underwear or any piece of cloth she can find when they are crying and she does it rough too or it just looks like it but is it normal
some needed context prior to this incident when i was in th grade there was this incident where i brought an old phone to class so i could play a game with my friends during recess my mother allowed me to bring it to school but i think she never brought it up with my dad later during the day when my dad arrived home he called me name and confronted me about it i responded truthfully and he took out his belt and began beating the shit out of me i was screaming in pain and shriveled into a ball on the floor if it wasnt for my sisters intervening i wouldve been sent to the hospital that event left me scarred ever since ive been avoiding my dad as much as i can since just looking at his face makes my fight or flight response activate i dont know if it should be labeled as ptsd since i dont want to jump to conclusions now for the incident that happened recently i was watching my show while eating dinner and my dad just appears out of nowhere and starts bad mouthing it as he does with anything i watchdo i just sat at the table debating if i should turn it off and leave or just sit there i came to a conclusion and turned it off since he obviously didnt like the show which was haikyuu and i just went to my room as i was done with my food a few minutes later he barges in my room and starts yelling at me like whyd you turn of the tv whyd you fucking do that and im shaking and bawling my eyes out as hes yelling at me he then picked up the mug on my table and threw water on me and just as the title says he threatened to throw the mug at me im sitting there on my bed having a panic attack and all my dad says is that i shouldnt be crying since he didnt hit me my mom walks in and just doesnt do anything but when he leaves she just says i shouldnt be crying since i brought this on myself i dont know if i really did bring this on myself or not
i tend to find it extremely easy to emotionally bond with and have empathy for animals especially cats but i tend to often find it harder to open myself up in that way to humans i suspect this is because while my parents were often emotionally abusive or neglectful we had cats and our cats were always there for me i always played with them when i was sad i could cuddle up with them stuff like that and i have this feeling that cats being this emotionally supportive presence in my life whereas my parents were often not and sometimes quite the opposite is what caused me to feel this way about cats compared to humans anyone else have something similar
i genuinely need help my parents think im going insane basically i had a lock on my door its one of those metal slidey ones i say had because my dad has broken two of them and now i use wooded lollipop sticks instead of the metal slider so no one barges in while im changing this may sound narcissistic but im very smart im the smartest in my grade and i always get perfect scores in tests i never ask my parents for help regarding school i dont have any allergies or phobias and i dont create a fuss today my dad barged into my room because i was getting stressed about what clothes to wear for an event it was business casual and i only own hoodies and leggings he proceeded to scream at me block my door so i couldnt leave and threaten to lock me up in a mental asylum my mum came in and was crying i started shouting because my room was very messy i was wearing pyjamas they werent letting me leave i was on my period so mood swings i had a migraine etc for about an hour they screamed at me and i wont deny that i screamed back my mum kept saying that i was too anxious over nothing shes convinced that i have anxiety and yet theyve never took me to a therapist or whatever all my friends with things like that get counselling in school i dont like celebrations where im the centre of attention for example my birthday i asked if we could just treat my birthday like any regular day this year but they refused my mum said it was ok and that i didnt have to do anything and yet today she said that something was wrong with me because i couldnt even open birthday presents in front of my family i said that i couldnt look at them the same and that i planned to leave the house as soon as i could and never come back she started hysterically laughing at me while i was sobbing and said that i was being dramatic unfortunately i have to live here for three more years but im going to look into getting emancipated id like to get therapy or something but idk i feel like i could be way worse im a perfect student i barely complain and i get things done i dont understand why everyone makes such a huge fuss over me not being social and not liking attention yeah its unusual but i dont think it makes me insane i cant give much more info for fear of them finding me but i will try answer any questions i genuinely want people to be honest if you think im a psychopath tell me the truth and tell me what i can do
i have always viewed my mum as safe and like she was going through the same thing as me so it felt like she understood i have now slowly come to the realisation that she was an adult and i was only a child and she should have protected me against his abuse she completely ignored the fact he was abusing me and ignored the signs that i was suffering she saw my self harm and did and said nothing to me as she knew his abuse was the cause and she had no intention of addressing it
i am not sure what to do in this situation i feel so lost and confused and like there is no escape i just want to let it out it hurts keeping it as a secret for years my mother and i have always been close and on a good and normal day when she doesnt drink she is my closest friend almost like the gilmore girls she is very dramatic eccentric and childish however the moment she drinks she gets extremely violent and says a lot of mean things to me that i am unable to forget no matter how much time passes or the amount of times she says she is sorry i am a very shy person who is really quiet but i also get angry easily and that is because my mom knows all of the trigger words that result in my becoming short tempered for example blaming me in every situation we were at the store she wanted to get a cola but forgot and she blamed me for not reminding her ever since i was a kid my mother would turn into an extremely childish person who would want to be in the center of attention after a few drinks and would do silly things like sing dance pee on the floor etc i always tried to stop her from the embarrassment or looking like an idiot infront of people but then she would get focused on me and start to attack me a lot of times verbally my moms abusive nature would come out even when she doesnt drink like if i would spill something she would beat me up so i would always try to wipe any spills or drops with my sock when i was so here a few situations my father and mother were arguing like a usual couple but my mom would take it in a wrong way and instead of being an adult she would victimize herself and say that she wasted years of her life on me and him she would hit my dad and when my dad isnt at home she would take it out on me in one of the instances she once hit me with a belt and the metal part hit my eye i had to go to the first day of school with a black eye whenever my mom drinks she would say things like i would have aborted you you have no friends my teacher tells you how much all of your friends hate you you are an abusive sad person i hate your voice it is your own fault because of you i wasted years of my life you are loser and you have achieved nothing as a kid she left me alone with babysitters to go out with her friends to bar or clubs and come back late and pass out my mother and i didnt have a relationship whatsoever as a kid and alot of time i felt as though she resented me it felt like i had to compete with her for my fathers attention and she would on purpose make me uncomfortable by walking around the house in sexy lingerie or tell me that she wants to have sex with my dad and i have to leave the house all of that would make me super uncomfortable and as a preteen it made me angry that she would tell me stuff like that so i fought with her a lot my dad would side with me but my mom would say of course the two of you protect each other i am alone type crap she would kick me throw chairs at me and when i was super mad and took her phone away because she was calling random people to complain about how i am a very bad person she grabbed a knife and told me to give back her phone she was extremely drunk then every time she would mess up she would reverse the situation and gaslight me into thinking none of it happened and i imagined it because i am an egotistical person and that i am abusive after a few rounds of arguments regarding the fact that i am a bad person and she is the victim she would constantly tell me to come and to hug her and she would say forget about it we are both at fault i love you but my heart would ache from the pain i had to endure just last night she came back from a wedding drunk and we had a very bad fight she did her usual do something stupid to make me mad i get upset and tell her to stop doing something she verbally insults me i tell her to go to sleep i grab her and make her go to her room she attacked me and i had no sleepcuz she kept coming to fight she woke up and blamed me from being physical with her and that she is scared of me what the hell should i do
so im not really sure how to word this or what you would consider this but im still kind of shaken up but weve been having problems with one of my dogs for a while because hes been obsessed with my smaller dog and barks a lot randomly the smaller dog is mine but the one were having trouble with is my parents dog their dog started barking and my stepdad got mad so he got up and rushed over at him he tried to kick him in the side but i think he missed and then said he was gonna start using his shock collar to shock the hell out of him just because in his own words i feel sick to my stomach my stepdad has never been violent to me except verbally when he felt i was being disrespectful but he has with my sister and his dog i already know im gonna get some stuff telling me to reach out to somebody about this but my entire family would deny anything and it would only put me in a bad position i just want to talk to somebody about this i feel terrible for not doing anything im sorry if ive come to the wrong place i dont want to disrupt a community i just dont know
i have a situation a friend of mine f she is and always has been a model student and daughter who always puts her family first and scores the top grades through school and college with her teachers and colleagues singing her praises to her parents she is being mistreated by her ungrateful parents who are hell bent on controlling her every living moment and decesion she has no social life because of them and if once in a blue moon she tries to go out with her friends it becomes into a whole fiasco with her parents and younger brother berating her about how she doesnt care about her familys reputation even though she has never done anything to put even a blemish on it and has only raised it ever since she could think on her own her brother on the other hand who she naively cherishes and would do anything for is an ungrateful son of a bitch who only takes and takes from her is a failure in every scope of his life takes advantage of her love and makes demands of her like he deserves anything but a slap though anychance he gets he creates doubt in her parents mind about her character and how she might be talking to her boyfriend anytime she is on a call or is spending time with him anytime she is even half an hour late to come home from work all he does for her is put fuel in the fire that she is trapped in her parents though act all progressive and liberal about how she is the apple of their eye and how they ask in front of their relatives but in the walls of their own home they threaten her by saying that they will marry her off anytime she does something on her own volition something that makes her happy and even her brother adds to it and often suggests it himself they say that she may do anything she likes after she is married off when she says that she has a job a college life that she is committed to they say that it doesnt matter and she can just stop going all in all they want to tie her up and never let her leave the house she is not even able to go at the end of her street without being bombarded by questions her father puts up her every act as a threat to his reputation even though it is her brother who is very well capable and willing to drown it and she has only glorified his so called reputation ever since she was she helped him in his business taught him how to use his own fucking computer when she was but all of that is either forgotten by them or they dont care and are just ungrateful bastards as her friend i want to make them pay atleast realise what kind of gem their daughter is because i am not kidding or overdoing it one but that she is the kind of daughter people pray for and someday i might too please give me ideas or another way so that i can help this friend of mine
so for context my sister lives a few cities away and i live minutes next to my parents i am always there for them and help them as much as i can ill readily help them whether thats financially or housework my mother has recently had surgery and needs help so i spent the day cooking a big batch of food to give to them its not the first time ive done that i tend to help a lot more since my sister hardly comes down to see us yesterday my uncle mums brother his wife and son came to see her she commented that im a good cook however my sister is a better cook since she lives far away this upset me a lot not sure whether it should or not because i dont felt like she was undermining me after they left i calmly explained to my parents and their replies were you act like we should be grateful that youre here and your sister is not and also dont bother cooking anymore im not sure where i went wrong or if i was being touchy their replies hurt me more rather than understanding that actually they upset their daughter
im and i really needed to make some money to save up for a car i sent some applications to a few places but got no answer from any my mom told me to get a job where she works at so i applied and got the job during the interview the manager slightly mentioned that he knows how hard my mom works also complimented her on a few other things and because he knows how hard my mom works he assumed that i will be the same though i can agree shes a hard worker him praising her really upset me he praised her on how nice and respectful she was and i couldnt help but feel awful i know this might be stupid and he only knows her as a good hardworking employee and not a physically and emotionally abusive mother and i know its not his fault but him praising her really just upset me it just sucks to see her get praised when shes so awful to me and my siblings i know that at work shes so nice and her coworkers like her but i just cant wrap my head around the fact that shes so kind at work and calm but she gets home and gets upset at the smallest reason and starts yelling i know that its dumb for me to get upset knowing that her coworkers have no idea how she really is but i cant help myself
i f am planning on going abroad for my degree not necessarily out of my country but out of my state in order to pursue psychology as none of the colleges in my town or state are any good for psychology my parents on the other hand insist that it is not necessary and that they would miss me when im gone i dont understand why people who have abused me for so long and say they regretted giving birth to me cant think logically whenever it comes to my future i understand that theyd miss me but isnt it important for me to grow and be independent sometimes theyre overbearing and other times theyre assholes i dont know how to convince them to go abroad esp since theyre still deadset on me pursuing medical even tho i have made it very clear i do not wish to do so they keep insisting its because my future will be good filled with money and ill be successful even though being happy is also my priority how do i convince my parents to let me study psychology abroad

before i narrate my experience i want to clarify that i live in an asian country where women cant move out of their homes unless theyre moving ou of citycountry or until they get married my mother and i were extremely close during my early childhood since my birth my parents had shifted to another city in which we had no family due to my fathers job as an only child i grew extremely comfortable of having only them around and was very attached to both of them however even then my mother had always been extremely strict and critical for example shed always expect me to be at the top of my class and i remember being scared of not coming first because what would my mother think of me regardless i had a very codependent attachment style with her and remember loving her a lot all of that changed when my father took retirement and we were supposed to shift back to my parents previous hometown my mother and i shifted a few months earlier than my dad and i was only at that time the only place she could think of staying was at her own parents home who had died and this is also where her sister resided with her family we took the upper floor but my world turned upside down when my mothers sister started abusing me in every way imaginable except sexually sometimes she would mock me and ridicule me for my appearance and when id complain she would beat me up relentlessly shoes belts slaps punches you name it other times she would just call me disobedient and use that as an excuse to beat me up in all of those occasions my mother never intervened she never protected me she never even stepped in and said stop what you are doing to my daughter shed just watch me getting beaten up and then later come to me and tell me that its for your own good when id threaten them that i would call and tell my father they would lock me up and prevent me from speaking to him all of my calls with him would be monitored in fact whenever my fathers siblings would visit and we would visit them id be told to not tell them anything personal because we shouldnt tell anyone what goes on at home what happens at home is private and cant be discussed once my father moved in with us things got better for a while until it started again in other ways my father got another job and hed be away for most of the day if my aunt wouldnt hit me id be ridiculed shamed for absolutely everything i used to love sketching at the time and she would mock me for being so bad at it and i remember once that she saw a sketch made by me tore it up and threw it on the floor and then she brought the broom and put it in the trash i dont remember sketching after that day even during those incidents my mother never stepped in instead when id try to fight for myself she would scold me and then later force me to apologise to her sister when my father would step in hed get thrashed by my mother a couple of years later my father bought and built a home for us to move into and thats when my nightmare came true my mothers sister decided to move in with us she used the excuse that she had to sell her parents home as my mother wanted her share of the property and somehow she was our responsibility now my father had absolutely no say in the matter as my mother had made his life hell also why he never took a divorce i will never understand and maybe thats the only thing i will never forgive him for in our new home my aunt tortured me just as much i was then once when i fought back she tried to suffocate me with my own pillow i remember my mother meekly asking her to not to do it she also scratched me on my face and i remember having a giant scar on my eyebrow and my mother blackmailed me into not telling anyone why i got it i dont understand how or why i obeyed her but i did i told no one they moved away a couple months after that it wasnt because of what she had done to me but because her husband could finally afford to pay rent in a separate home the physical abuse stopped and hasnt happened to this day she was always a tormentor though and is to this day since my mother is still pretty close to her she is often visiting our place and sometimes she says or does something because of which i fight back even after all these years my mother never took my side my relationship with my mother never got fixed because of this she never defended me and i will never forgive her for it last week an incident occurred because of which i had to intervene and i did so in a very calm manner next thing i know my aunt called screamed at me and called me names before cutting the calls i was not at all disrespectful even though considering the monster she is i should have been my mother was listening to all of this and her next move wasnt at all surprising she called her sister and started taking her side and after that call when i screamed at her about her sister being such a monster my mother had the audacity to scream at me and asked me to shut up since that fight my mother and i have not spoken in fact after pulling verbally abusing me her sister had the audacity to come over to our place and taunt me again but this time i was firm and fought back equally which pissed my mother off even more what broke my heart most was how my mother was sitting with her sister having coffee and the only thing i could think of was i would never sit with my daughters abuser much less give them my time of the day in previous incidents when something like this occurred i try my best to communicate with my mother later i try to tell her how much her actions have traumatised me and how my entire life has been affected by her lack of protecting me and each time she promises to do better either that or she finds horrible excuses to defend herself or even her sister if nothing else she asks me to forgive and forget i have been to therapy and i have tried everything in the book to help myself get through this i want to break free of this constant pain of feeling unsafe i have occasional nightmares and wake up crying and screaming and in all of those nightmares what hurts more isnt that my aunt is abusing me but that my mother never defends me i cannot move out of the country because my father is old and sick and the only family i really have i love him enough to give up everything else in the world but all this pain is making me go insane and i no longer know what to do i dont involve my father usually because of his health problems but when i do he stands by my side and fights for me but it is pointless because my mother is extremely controlling and emotionally blackmails everyone i want to clarify that it may seem that my mother is lonely and dependent on her sister and that is not true it may also seem that my mother is in an abusive marriage which could explain why she thinks its okay to tolerate abuse and that is also not true my father although not the most romantic man on earth has never even spoken to my mother in a loud tone he has always been caring loving and supportive despite my mother treating him like absolute shit
i am a yearold boy and my older brother is my favourite and i had no problem with him we were very close until he reached the second grade of middle school strange things began to appear in his behavior he treated me like a monster and he kept hitting and cursing at me i used to say that this was normal this was my teenage period and my mother was like that when he reached the third grade of middle school my fate changed and he started beating me unreasonably as if i was torturing him the time i reached him he broke my leg and my body is all bruised when one of my friends suddenly says i say dont know or i fell and he keeps hitting me he is upset for example i am sitting in the safety of god and he gets into a stressful situation and gets up he beat me and my mother does not know how to deal with us and unfortunately i do not know how to defend myself and he hits me bringing out all the anguish and resentment in his heart unfortunately these words are not in front of my father and since a month ago my brother has been tired and i have been taking care of this and when he is very tired he is upset and goes to hit me i have been getting better throughout the month and his beatings have increased greatly when my father found out he said i am the one who made a mistake and want to create problems out of nowhere when i show him all the beatings and bruises he tells me you are definitely not annoying him but by god i have not done anything to him in the past two weeks the beatings have been a lot and severe as for psychologically and physically i have perished and i have accumulated some money should i rent a small room to live in alone and work but i dont cut relationship with my mother and i really need your help i hope someone comes across what happened to me and tells me a solution and i will be very thankful im sorry that i took so long with you
ps this is long im sorry so i am a year old male well im trans female to male only a few people in my family know this information due to my family being either heavily conservative and that means they come with being homophobic basically i live with my grandma due to my mom leaving when i was pretty young and my dad passing when i was around i am the youngest out of three ever since then my grandma has normally been nice she got mean when my older brother neared and he started to act out she clearly took her anger out on him and hit him yelled etc well he moved out when he turned no hesitation she skipped over my older sister and went straight to me she says its because im like my mother and no one likes my mother lately its been getting worst normally she would yell insults at me but now shes hitting throwing things and leaving bruises just for the smallest things yes ive been on contact with cps multiple times but they do little to no help they constantly just saying she is grieving since my dad is her son and im not disregarding her grief its real i know trust i know some more back story a lot has happened to me from starting around years my mom being a raging alcoholic and drug addict and kidnapping me and my siblings on multiple occasions seeing my dad bash a mans head into a wall until he was just blood and brains my dad getting cps called on him by my mom being sad by my brother when i was and so much in my teenage years to now i go to therapy but it seems like it doesnt really help i have diagnosed severe depression severe anxiety and severe ptsd my grandma knows this she just doesnt care at all she doesnt believe in that stuff with her doing more physically abusive lately its really been declining my mental state and that plus working long shifts isnt helping she also doesnt allow me to take my antidepressants anymore my therapist is also not available this whole month im not sure how to deal with it anymore

before i start i just wanted to apologize if anything i say doesnt make sense i have a very hard time wording things properly especially when im talking about something sensitive so pls bare with me growing up i never really had a good relationship with my father after i turned f i think is when our relationship started getting bad he used to yell at me just to come into the living room so he could yell at me again about my weight which to be fair i was a bigger kid but our familys diet didnt help that one bit my father liked having meat red meat potatoes and a slice of bread every night after work and he hated it when my mom and i would eat something else hed go on about how theres no point in us even eating as a family anymore if we dont eat the same meal oh and if supper wasnt ready when he got home he got home at around pm he owns a roofing company so he controls his hours he would pout about it for hours on end and accuse my mom of trying to starve him all day because he refused to eat during the day despite being diabetic another thing that was an issue with my weight was my insulin resistance which i didnt even know i had until recently anyways because of my insulin resistance my neck used to be really dark and my dad thought that was because i wasnt washing myself properly so he would make my mom scrub my neck everyday for months until my neck was bleeding and it would be a scab the next day no one thought that they shouldve brought me to a doctor even once he also found it entertaining to torment my mom and i we spent most of our summers traveling on the road and camping with family and his favourite thing to do was either grab me or my mom and yell really really loud to scare us while he was driving and me and my mom both have severe anxiety so you can imagine how it affected us my father was also just really weird towards me i remember this one morning i was getting ready for my schools picture day i was in grade or something like that so this was still very exciting and fun for me so i spent all morning picking out my outfit and curling my hair with my mom we put sparkly hairspray in my hair and i loved it and the first thing my dad did was look me up and down whistle and called me sexy this happened maybe more times he even called one of my younger cousins from another province sexy she was like or maybe we had a lot of horses when i was younger and my father had a close friend who was a farrier he put horse shoes on horses and trimmed their hooves and stuff and everyone had this running joke i dont think it was actually a joke but this is what everyone said it was so i say it was where i was dating the farrier ill call him r in this post ig and there were so many times where he would grab me and sit me on his lap and sometimes my parents would leave me in the barn alone with him and he would try kiss me and touch me my mom never said anything about what was happening and my dad always laughed it off and called me rs girlfriend himself i also had a niece whos older than me by or years and when i was she would get me to sneak out to our old farm trucks to smoke cigarette butts and when we were home alone my sister would bring her to my dads so we could play together she would turn on a porn channel on the tv and make me watch with her there were hundreds of times where we got caught but no one ever said or done anything it was always a quick oh you shouldnt be watching that and someone would switch the channel and move on though we did get caught smoking and we got into deep shit for that one of my sisters smelt cigarette smoke in the basement one morning and told my dad im sorry if this is a huge mess with grammar and spelling mistakes i have only shared this with my therapist and i have tried to talk to my mom a few times so i can maybe get some closure on some stuff but everytime i have she either plays it off calls me over dramatic or invalidates me i wanted to try lift the weight off my shoulders at least a little more than i have with my therapist because of the things i had to put up with my mental health has had a tight grip on my life but i think im finally starting to slowly heal
f my moms hit and intimidated me since i was younger never taught me boundries never taught me what was right or wrong just yelled at me for doing wrong they didnt treat my cat right and neither did i he died when i was from some sort of poisioning since he went outside alot and i didnt rlly know that was wrong either i feel guilt for the way i treated my cat even though i didnt wanna hurt him i looked after kittens before and im scared i somehow abused them without realising my friend dropped one kitten bc it scratched her obviously i got mad but it was an accident we tried to comfort the cat but the black kitten didnt really like being touched this was a year ago i used to always pick them up and stuff they meowed alot but idk if that means they hated it or noti never hurt them or anything i just wish i stopped bothering them i dont trust myself at all and constantly blame myself even though id never abuse a cat or hurt anything or try traumatise one i love animals i feel horrible that i couldnt do anything abt how they treated my childhood cat i was so clingy and so aggressive not to hurt but i was never told it was bad so i used to pull him playfight with him not aggressively js gently scare and chase him spray him put stuff on his head like in those vids where some sort of teabox or smth is on the cats head i was around i never kicked or hit him from what i remember i still dont trust myself though i used to tell my family to stop whenever they shouted at him or was mean to him but i couldnt do much about it and my cat always used to scratch me really hard but i js thought it was playing not signs of uncomfiness or scared i even remember searching up im scared i abused my cat when i was like years old because i blamed myself for everything ive had anxiety like that sicne i was little so thats all i passed it off as i just thought i love him and id never hurt him so im just being stupid even a few days ago my friend brang up we just use to drop ur cat off ur stairs like a few steps up and i said yes but we didnt throw him and we weere young i just panicked because i didnt know if it was wrong and now my brains telling me i was excusing my behaviour thats just one part my mom scares me and hits and hurts me she acts like a normal loving mom alot of the time but shes literally tackled threatened hit chased thrown things screamed intimidated locked me outside never really monitered my internet or behaviours didnt find it a big deal when i was sad by my ex friend and used it to just send hate to her family bc she didnt like them constantly had police over when my mom and sister fought and i cried bc i thought i was gonna be taken away my mom used to say things like ill smash ur head into a wall from even when i was real youngduring our family holiday in she was physically fighting my aunt and other family with a literal bed leg they both were she came up to me i was crying and said im going to kill her referencing to my aunt the next family holiday this year was fine up till the last day they screamed and my mom threw something at my nan i snapped and shouted back i usually do this anyways my mom saw me making sexual stuff on a game when i was and all she did was scream and tell my sister to monitor everything i did even tho she couldnt give a shit about me anyway this behaviour has passed onto me im not excusing what i did people ive upset have a right to be mad obviously but i cry everytime i realise i snapped at a friend or my bf without realising and i upset them its become so bad that ive noticed i lie abt almost everything even trauma just to feel valid ive put myself in situations where i hoped something traumatic would happen because for some reason i wanted that attention ive split constantly on my bf become attached to him hes taking a break now and honestly he might not even come back i try to please people who hurt me because i hate being hated i hate being misunderstood ive said and done so many horrible things to the point i feel i dont deserve life or love i have the urge to leave everyone im not including a big chunk of whats happened to me bc alot of it isnt relevant to the sub i should hate u mom i should hate u family but i dont i love them and have fun and make jokes with them im a piece of shit overall i dont know how i even have people around me

im writing this as im coming to the realization that i will be leaving my two younger brothers with my father who is verbally and physically abusive towards us since i was born my dad has been verbally and physically abusive he would get mad when things did not go his way or when he did not like how events played out i did not know this behavior was not normal until one day when i was younger and he had hit me and told me to cover up the next day before school so that no teachers took me away he would only hit me when i did bad things as a child misbehaved or got bad grades in school he wanted me to be this perfect child the same went towards my sister who is two years younger than me he always tells me when i die you will be grateful and remember how i raised you but thats far from the truth he did not hit my mother but he did verbally abuse her and my grandparents for years he would call me all sorts of names and degrade me as he punished me for my bad behavior that i now know is things kids do at times like spill water on the floor or being scared of the dark i am currently and im about to move out to be closer to my college campus my sister who is just about to start college is going to be dorming at her new college this leaves my two younger brothers age and to stay living with him although my dad is not longer as abusive as he once was and as strict it is still pretty bad i cant stand the thought of leaving my little brothers to endure that type of physical and mental abuse they are both the kind and shy my youngest brother who is has adhd and anxiety diagnosed by a doctor already which my dad does not believe he says the doctors are wrong since such things do not exist i can already see how scared my brothers are of him and im worried they will suffer the way me and my sister did when we were younger i see how my dad screams yells berates and even hits them but im too scared to say or do anything for fear of what he might say or do to me he has threatened to hit me or kick me out since my brothers are financially dependent on my dad and mom i dont know what to do i want to step in and stop him from yelling or hitting them but im scared im years old but i still get scared of what he will do to me i cant even hate him properly since he is still my dad i just need advice on what to do
im not sure where it all began but the earliest i can remember is when i was being groomed it was from the ages of im now she found out about it and called the cops on the guy now sure that seems like a decent parenting move until after she made the call she came into my room dragged me by my hair and told me that the only person you should be calling daddy is your father and that id never know what a penis would feel like who would say that to their kid let alone a year old sure i was a dickhead kid and tried sneaking on my devices after she took them all away but it was only to contact my school friends she noticed the tablet was gone and came into my room so i pretended to be asleep she saw it as i was trying to get back in contact with the guy that groomed me so her best idea was to tell me to wake the fuck up and when i wouldnt move she started beating me of course she took the tablet away from me but what is beating me senseless gonna do it didnt stop there either the summer after i caught myself trying to run away because of an argument we had over my room being a complete mess she had kept bickering with me over it and i wasnt having it so i told her to leave me alone and she went batshit she took one of my mason jars filled with beads and smashed it at my feet of course i stepped in it while closing my door and i decided i was going to leave through the fire escape i ran all the way to my friends house and she tracked me there and had the police called my whole family showed up and she took my phone away weve gotten into many petty arguments since and i have been trying to avoid her until tonight my sister follows in my mothers footsteps and is like her little pet she snitches and me and all types of other shit she got me in trouble over a charger which caused my mom to go on a rant about how i am disrespectful and spoiled and the least i could do is help out with my sister which i do indeed do more than i should have to if she goes to work at am and wakes up at am my sister is awake at the time so why not feed her before you leave she takes minutes to get ready every time i try talking to her she ends up venting about herself and i hate it she tells me that i can talk to her yet makes it about herself all the time ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety yet whenever i try explaining to her that i can get myself out of it on my own she gets mad and starts taking away the things i like doing as if theyre a distraction with the way she acts im scared of even moving out when i turn in fear of what shell do to my stuff or me to make it so that i cant yes i do realize that she cannot legally do that but its hard for me to get the courage for it ive told many people and i have gone to the police about it a few times but they have always taken her word for it over mine because shes an adult i know for a fact that all my nearby relatives that could take me in while im not with her are on her side and they see me as disrespectful and lazy because of the things she tells them about me she has made threatening remarks in the past month about blacking out on me or punching me in my face or even going as far as saying shed drag me down the stairs by my hair shes made many comments regarding my body and how we need to get in shape though she had to get surgery to lose hers and doesnt even go through with it she will go days without buying groceries and claims that shes depressed and stressed about work and compares it to my diagnosis at every opportunity she gets i dont know what to do as far as taking action to get out and ive been seeking help for the longest reddit is my only option at this point i barely use this app to begin with lol
my mom often puts me down by stating things like im irresponsible or that i dont care about anything and it honestly makes me really mad and upset if i fiercely tell her to stop because it hurts my feelings shell think im just talking back and being disrespectful how do i very nicely tell her to keep quiet and not say things like that because they make me feel like maybe i am irresponsible and thats not good for my selfesteem in a way where she actually listens and stops
my mom was abusive and a drug addict she abused and starved me locked me in a room and pretty much lowered me down to nothing but a maid my siblings grew up calling me slave until i was years old i left my moms to go live with my dad who wasnt in my life before i was everything was going so well until i found out hes a domestic abuser he beat my stepmom and really hurt her when my child was months old everyone forgave him i was iffy and he seemed to really be working on himself and bettering his mental health i was so willing to give him another chance and have a relationship with my daughter never leaving him alone with her though ever he did it again recently cutting him off hurts me but ive already cut off my own mother so its something that im used to however what hurts the most is knowing my baby is going to grow up not knowing either of her biological grandparents im so thankful that my stepmom took on the role of grandma and loves her but i know one day shes going to ask questions about my parents and thats going to be a hard conversation i know its the best thing for her but it shouldnt have been this way in the first place she was just getting to the age where she knew grandpa and had gotten so attached to him and it really breaks my heart for her idk this shit is just so hard
after so long of being a fucking control freak this is the first time he was ever in my level to talk to me hes always dismissed my autism saying its something ill grow out of he said finally that its ok that i have problems its ok i still have issues but honestly this is the most happy tears ive cried in my life i just hope i can have this forever
i was very sensory seeking when i was little and sometimes when i was in the bathtub i would get on my arms like i was doing a push up and then start rocking back and forth because i liked the way the bumpy texture on the bottom of the shower felt on my skin and i figured out at some point that my penis was more sensitive than most of my other parts so i would sometimes rock back and forth against the floor for the sensory input it wasnt sexual because i had no concept of that as a small child but sometimes my body would react to the stimulation my earliest memory is my of older cousin who i i later confirmed was at the time coming in to check on me in the bathtub for some reason and her catching me doing this when i would have been and her yelling at me when she realized what i was doing her yelling scared me so i got out of the bath and ran crying to my mother but when i tried to hug her she saw that i was naked and that i had an erection from the physical stimuli of the aforementioned sensory seeking behavior i remember her face turning bright red with anger as she pushed me away to grab me by my arm with a death grip and then she spanked me with her other hand until it felt like my whole back was on fire i remember my cousin crying and begging her to stop and my mother yelling at her to get out once she was finally done spanking me she made me stand up and then forced me go stand in the corner with my nose against the wall still naked sobbing and covered with my own snot shaking like crazy from fear and pain i remember her making me stand there until i was so tired i physically fell over then she spanked me again until i was screaming and i either passed out or blocked out the rest because i dont remember her stopping the next thing i remember i was laying face down on her bed and she sat next to me and put a frozen bag of something on my butt and legs i remember that she told me that i had been a very bad boy and that because she loved me so much she had to punish me to make sure i learned my lesson and didnt go to hell i still to this day as a now year old man have an incredibly hard time engaging in any form of sexual intimacy after working with a therapist i decided to bring up this memory to my mother when i confronted her she looked at me like i was crazy and accused me of making it up and called me sick she told it was a perverted fantasy that came only from my brain and told me to seek help i then brought it up a few weeks later with my older cousin she confirmed that she remembered it happening and cried because she felt like she caused it she was also a child i never blamed her i have talked to my therapist about it at length and part of me wants to confront my mother again with my cousin to back me up the other part of me knows that it doesnt matter how much proof i have she isnt going to admit it
my mom has been verbally abusive since i was about im now and had to grow up way too fast ill start from the beginning when i was under she would do stuff like yell at me constantly and point out how i was fat i was just a slightly chubby kid and she would always remind me of how she would cry herself to sleep because of me i never did anything mean to her i was little and didnt know how to control my emotions so i would often yell back and it would be an argument anyways when i was my mom started doing this thing where she would tell me that she would pack her bags and leave back to europe by the next morning that is terrifying to hear at that age because my mom is my primary caregiver i only see my dad weekends out of the that are in a month she would tell me that she was abandoning me after any little thing i did i dropped a mug when putting away dishes and it chipped a little bit and she told me she was gonna leave my mom has also been an alcoholic her whole life she drank during the pregnancy of her first child miscarriage and drank during her pregnancy with me she is scary when shes drunk she is x more verbally abusive and i sometimes have visions of her hitting me i dont think she would ever hit me but im not sure she also used to force me to sleep with her she made me sleep with her until i was like or then she would get mad and start screaming at me and saying how i hate her just because i wanted to sleep in my own bed my mom would also always want to see me naked anytime i would shower from the ages of puberty she would tell me to get naked infront of her so she could inspect if i showered properly which would result in her checking everywhere even my private parts she still asks me at my age of if she can come help me shower when i tell her no she always pulls the why do you hate me so much card the christmas of i was our tradition is to put up the christmas tree in the morning and then open gifts that night after supper anyways after we put the tree up i went and sat down at the kitchen table and picked up my phone to just relax a little bit my mom walked by and she went on a rant about how im always on my phone and then she said something ill never forget she told me this you are not the daughter i wanted i wish i never had you anytime i bring this up she tells me im lying and that she never said it when i literally have the date written down in my notes of when she said it i know this is long so ill just list off the other things she does she still spanks me in a joking way in public after me asking her and telling her countless times to stop she punishes me by not buying me groceries like if i dont get a chore done before she gets home shell go then i guess you dont get any groceries then i am in the beginning of the process of getting a lawyer and taking my mom to court so i can live with my dad id like some advice and some tips on how to deal with this thank you for listening to me
i hate my dad and i dont even know where to start on the reasons why i hate him i hate him i hate him he is the number one reason to every negative feeling i have and it seems like he cant stand me being happy so he has to ruin it i financially depend on him because im and the minimum wage of my country isnt enough to rent a flat plus im being paid less than minimum wage because no one else wanted to hire an unexperienced transgender teenager so im stuck on small gigs that can barely afford my lunch i dont think i can stand being alive in the same world as him one of us has to die and if he is not dying then i will i will keep trying to kill myself until his death im tired of being alive and wasting my days because he keeps hurting me and the police doesnt do anything because he doesnt hurt physically yea sure sure he never beat me but he insulted me of every word possible tried to disappear with objects to make me think im going crazy says things and then when i cry about it he says that he didnt said anything and that im making things up because im an attention seeker he forces me to do things and then call me ungrateful for not enjoying them the list goes on and on forever i will keep trying to die until i either succefully finish it or until he dies by himself

i f have a somewhat distant relationship with my parents im trans live in another city and am polyamorous which they dont yet know and undiagnosed but probably autistic which is its own can of worms i was recently lectured by my father m about why hes suddenly stopped accepting me as trans again i came out seven years ago and he initially came around to it and my mum f remains supportive just worries about my physical safety one of the arguments he tried to make really irked me he said i now need to detransition because he is finding it hard to accept that when i get into a relationship it needs to be with a cis woman because that was the idea hes had for me since i was born my mum wants me to move back to their town because shes struggling with the distance they said i need to live life for others and that means that sometimes i need to sacrifice my own happiness if i do not do these things this will be seen as a selfish act on my part my father has also threatened me with the idea that im causing them to want to split up and that my mum might kill herself if that happens as shes around menopause age and thus i need to be careful with her i can thankfully see this for what it is emotional blackmail i used to struggle with selfharm and suicidal ideation myself and i wouldnt even dream of using my mental health as leverage in an argument surely my parents relationship with each other is their responsibility not mine im a sensible person i understand when sacrifices actually need to happen i plan things out and make sure i have a safety net i am completely independent and stable financially and havent so much as gone to my parents for advice in about a decade but the sacrifices theyre asking for are the things that are making me happy in life id love to be closer to these people but i feel more hurt every time we meet i genuinely cant even confidently say i love them any more im just terrified of the fallout they threaten me with its making me miserable honestly its been this way for years is this abuse how can i communicate to them that im my own person and that i cant just throw away my relationships just to make it easier for them to deal with tldr parents want me to make enormous changes to my life because they find it hard to deal with framing my decisions as selfishness i want to know whether this is considered abusive and to communicate that i can no longer tolerate this

disclaimer i have depression and anxiety that stems from my fathers constant emotional abuse as a child this is all from my point of view and i really hope its not misunderstood im not delusional so my dad and i have never had the best relationship ever since my parents divorce he comes from a lot of generational trauma and sometimes that would carry over onto my sisters and i i always tried to impress him and tried to be the perfect child i was the like his counsellor as a child his emotional punching bag in a way of words hed often tell me that he was more harsh on me since i reminded him of my mom eventually as i grew up i couldnt stand it and slipped deeper into my depression i ran away from him in a sense i guess sorry dont want to go into the details i went to go live with my mom and it was great to be honest but eventually my mom slipped back into her substance abuse i retreated back to my dads since i mentally was doing a lot worse it was fine we fought quite a lot and didnt get along but eventually i tried to just keep my opinions to myself now back to the main issue i fought with my dad again hes always talking about my weight and usually i can ignore it but i couldnt this time and snapped i said a lot of horrible words like swearing off and telling him to go away but he began to follow me and yell he had that crazy look in his eye that ive always been scared of and we kept arguing and he started to say that hell smash my head into the ground if i dont stop talking saying he picked me up and he can take me out i was obviously upset and to be honest i wouldnt put it past him if he did do the things he was threatening me with since he has a history of abusing women in the past and with the one off occasion with my step mom he finally left me and i started crying on the porch my step brother saw me and i asked for a hug and explained he threatened to hurt me i later told my sister and she just said she didnt know what to say i spent the next couple of days avoiding him because i was scared i started to plan on how to move out but ive never lived somewhere without my parents so im terrified i thought eventually hed come apologize like he usually does since i thought he went to far but he never did until tonight days after the fight he told me i was mentally deranged and that me going around the house complaining about him was wrong that everyone thought i was strange and mentally unwell that what i was doing was wrong am i going insane am i the one in the wrong im so scared that hes right and that my sister hates me i dont know what to do if anyone has any advice or can put their two cents in id greatly appreciate it i cant go to my sister anymore since i have reason to believe she is fed up with me thank you for reading
hi my f boyfriend m is allowing me to make this post in search of advice on what to dolegal advice because his parents are forcing him to play soccer my boyfriend has been playing soccer since he was about or and has been in both club and school teams for his entire life he used to enjoy the sport but even in the beginning his father would berate him force him to practice for hours in the morning and then hours at night his father had also physically and verbally abused him when my boyfriend was or and the physical abuse stopped a little before the age of all of the subsequent emotional and verbal abuse since then has been to call my boyfriend a failure an underachiever a loser etc even though he is one of the top players on his club team but even if he were one of the worst its still no excuse in the past year my boyfriend has suffered two major injuries an almost completely torn through ligament in his leg and a torn shoulder ligament both of which required massive surgeries with the longest healing time lasting months and weeks upon weeks of physical therapy despite this factor and a major depressive episode lasting months my boyfriends father forces him to practice soccer for hours in the morning most days and sometimes still more hours at night despite some residual pain in his knee and shoulder this is taking a large mental health toll on my boyfriend and he is visiting with a psychiatrist at least once a week for therapy appointments recently he has expressed to his parents that he wishes to quit soccer and desires to do things he actually likes my boyfriend has expressed to me that he believes he may have actually liked soccer if his father hadnt completely sucked the joy out of the sport despite this request to quit soccer his parents are continually forcing him to go to soccer college camps and compete in them this is making him depressed and anxious they complied for maybe a week before just yesterday manipulating him into saying yes his mother said he was selfish and a failure and that he is throwing away his natural talent they continue to taunt him and use me as a reason he is weak minded and a failure which is not true as a i would support him whether he wanted to play soccer or not oh and i forgot to mention they complied until the very night before he would have to leave for a two day long camp that is three states away he officially left about or hours ago because of my boyfriends mental health he has gotten resources from a mental health hospital but has never had to have had a visit there no shame if he did anyways but his mother has coerced him into going to the soccer camp by threatening that she would send him to inpatient for five days my boyfriend did not threaten self harm or suicide or anything that he would have to be sent away for she simply threatened it unprovoked because he didnt want to play soccer he is constantly being taunted by his father about soccer and his mother who is not innocent is complacent in everything and is allowing him to be abused in this manner she has told him from when he was little to hide the bruises his father gave him and has never really offered him a true feeling of safety with her even though she never laid a hand on him i believe her actions are deplorable and her and his father need to be held accountable the thing is though cps already knows about the abuse he endured as a child but is there something he can do about the threatening to send him to a mental hospital if he doesnt play soccer and would that be through cps if need be i feel like this situation is very specific and im trying to google how to do this but i feel like it might be good to find help from people who have maybe gone through something similar i also believe the forcing him to do a physical sport is a form of physical abuse and has to be acknowledged this has been going on for as long as he can remember and ive been dealing with this with him since three years ago when we started dating id also like to state that the verbal and emotional abuse doesnt just start and end with soccer but applies to every other corner of his life what can i do to help him and what can he do to help himself legal or general advice appreciated
i want to be get adted little helping hand
hi so im new on this app and i installed it since i knew theres a lot of people who may be in my situation my mom is abusive she is beating me daily for no reason and thinks i own her everything she also tells me daily how i should kym and she wishes she never had me even if i got used to it i still get hurt by her words she loves to make fun of me calling me names i have bpd and she makes so many jokes abt it by calling me crazy and how she wish i would get killed some day sometimes when she sees me happy she makes fun of my smile or find a reason to punish me im tired of living this way im poor i have no one to talk to abt this or to help me my mom even lie to everyone that she loves me and we have a very close bonding just so she can keep a good reputation i dont know what to do i cant call any kind of child service since in my country abusing ur kid is normal and nobody really cares i need help im and ive been thinking about running away but im sure i wont make it or i wont be safe by myself ik sorry for my bad english english is not my first language
my mom has always been good to me she never hurt me but shes always been a little strange as a kid i had the normal weird humor of any kid and my mom would joke like that etc but now im genuinely bothered by what happened so im at my aunts new apartment to shower because my hot water heater broke and we are looking for someone to install the new one and im sitting down in a chair playing on my phone and then my mom just walked over and sat on my lap now something to know is that ive dealt with sexual assault in the past so im very uncomfortable with some physical touch and stuff like that and she even told me shed stop her normal jokes playfully spanking me ever so often but hasnt anyways i told her dude its way too hot for this and she just laughed i almost slipped and said dude its way to fucking hot get off but i didnt anyways she wouldnt get up until i finally said fuck it and just shoved her off i dont know if its just normal teasing or not but its been bothering the hell out of me plus just me being paranoid im sure anytime i date a girl my mom will always find something to judge them by oh she seems like shes trying to hurt you and oh you havent even met her how do you know she isnt bad etc she always finds the slightest detail and tries to pry us apart another thing is she often touches me somewhat inappropriately excuse my language but it otherwise sounds childish she will randomly slap or pinch my ass and ive told her to cut the shit she said she would she doesnt i have had to slap the back of her hand away because she would keep doing it and its not bothering me a lot
there is no physical abuse but my mother is being a real control freak threatening my sis f with religion everything she does is based on religion corrupting my sisters view on reality and life other kinds of psychological abuse for example she just shouted at my sister shes useless because she didnt want to read a religious book this happens all the time always shouting and she has literally turned my sister into a monster too they always scream at each other always because mom tries to control everything about my sis she is the reason my sister is behind with everything compared to her peers socially and academically she still acts like a year old because she is being treated like a year old she doesnt even want to let my sister go to school not because she wants to homeschool her because she doesnt think it should happen she would rather raised my sis closed up in the house become a saint or whatever its like those cult movies you see she sis never gets acknowledged respected listened to and even when she does she is bombarded with god god afterlife sins devil god im scared she will grow to be obsessive paranoid anxious and ostracized by others she is already showing signs scared that god will punish her with every wrong thing she does shes anxious and paranoid she always has stomach aches never eats shes so thin and weak also bullied at school she can never fit in and this is moms fault i know what its like not to fit in but in this case its mostly my moms fault to turn my sis into this person she is its like a mini version of her the bad part about this is she still is by moms side mom has brainwashed her she slowly starts to rebel by not wanting to read the books but shes still by moms side a lot thats all shes known her entire life i really want to get her out of this but theres nothing i can do im f and we live the of us dads kind of out of the picture i mean not really but mom and dad are already separated almost for this exact reason dad cant be an option to take us in i wouldnt want that either all my moms side of the family could do is maybe talk to her but they would probably support my mom even if they didnt theres nothing they can do but theyre still all better thsn her idk thats it ig i just want her to grow to be a healthy individual
my mom keeps touching me inappropriately and when i confront her about it she just laughs and tells me to not take it personally i dont know what to do i feel like sht and i feel like its all my fault or idk but she taught me to always take the blame and suck it up even when i was not at fault now everything i do i cant go without feeling bad because i made another mistake i dont even know anymore my life is fued
my mom and sister work at the same company so shes controlling abt what time she wakes up and goes home bcus she basically drives her and her own sister who also works at the same company to work my sister wasnt waking up on time so she kept yelling abt it and when it was past the time she said wake up i need to go to work and earn a living if u dont want to then dont drag me down with you i need to earn a living bcus i have responsibilities not like you both who sleep all day and dont do anything and just think of yourself selfish even tho she told me before that i dont have to look for a job so soon i left my job in january due to my own stuff and basically due to burn out and probably mental illness ive been asleep almost of the time recently ive got back into gyming but damn ykno my moms sister is also a bitch bcus she always excuses my moms behaviour by saying shes the way she is bcus of my father well hes dead now so what now yknow also just bcus my dad is financially irresponsible doesnt mean she can just be a bitch to us and lash out at us all the time my mom also excuses herself by saying that well im just mad i just say things and dont mean it but takes every rejection from me or my sister very very personal it sucks living with her and i hate her it feels so alone when i think about it bcus for so long in my life my sister never really took my side when i would talk about her abuse and even now i feel bad for calling it abuse bcus i feel like it isnt so bad but everytime she reminds me why i feel this way and why i cant say anything to her abt anything god im so sorry i just feel so tired
i know its kinda selfish but ive gone through this crap for years and im so sick of it shes angered easily but a few minutes later will be totally fine she gets upset at simple mistakes i understand she has a lot of pressure on her shoulders but her outburst get more and more disturbing leading to outcomes worthy of a call or two to cps she acts like a child getting upset when things arent the way she thinks they should be i hate how she pushes this narrative that family should always come first which is good logic but not in this case i lost love for her a long time ago so much so that im unable to feel actual affection towards her shes very racist but she doesnt see it that way and very homophobic again she doesnt think that but when my brother came out as gay she started talking crap she also pushes everyone away then says everyone is fake and put to get her i cant wait til i can move out and dump her into a retirement home and let her rot for the rest of her days
so trigger warning talks about physical abuse i grew up in a brown household and am the firstonly daughter my mother was emotionally blackmailed into marrying my father by her parents and ive known this since i was a child they had me a year into their marriage and ive always known that she never really wanted to marry him now i understand what happened to her was wrong except shes chill with her family and has physically and mentally abused me and my siblings all of our lives my father has also been physically abusive occasionally and gaslights manipulates us but i know that he truly loves me and would do anything for me except i cant trust men my maternal grandfather passed away before my mothers wedding but he was the one who had initially started with the blackmailing because he had given her everything she wanted her entire life and in return she should listen to him she doesnt think he was in the wrong and that he was caring i hate him because i could never imagine taking my childs rights to decide for themselves everyone around me constantly praises him and i hate it ive never been able to truly trust my father because of this and have grown into a very defensive person i dont like people taking control of my life so growing up i would constantly try to draw a boundary growing up i never saw a healthy loving relationship between my parents in fact i was the one who had mediate their fights i would standup for my mother whereas her only family members would make fun of how they forced her but in the end they were the ones she loves it infuriates me because i consider them traitors i cant be nice to them because im always reminded of their shitty behavior especialy since they still make insensitive jokes and never take blame even though they do send me gifts and try to be affectionate i cant show affection to them now im at a point where ive started financially earning but i cant move out because i have to pay for my university and its against our culture i live in an asian country and tbh im not making enough im trying to change and get rid of the toxic traits that i have in me im very loud because ive always had to scream just to be heard and i wanna get rid of this and i curse a lot but ive realised its because my mother used to curse a lot and ive never been in any romantic relationships not even close because ive completely closed myself off im very emotional when it comes to my friends but im scared that i cant open up like that or my partner will use it against me its like even if i get out of this house the effects will always stay there everytime i start a new relationship what my parents did to me will stop it from evolving into anything good it took a long time for me to emotionally open up to friends but even now i get scared that im a nuisance to them and my parents keep gaslighting me and telling me that theyve never abused me it took me ages to get rid of the shame i felt as though i was in the wrong and that it was embarrassing to have parents who abuse me its so scary because they say that they did it with good intentions but they cant see that it ruined me i feel so broken and i dont know i just need to know that theres hope and that someone out there has survived and learnt and actually become a new person
hey this will be my first and probably only post on reddit i just needed somewhere to get it out of my mind and off my chest both of my parents suck and i dont have somewhere else to go my biological father is a monster hes diagnosed with schizophrenia and dependent personality disorder hes not a monster because of these diagnoses hes had many wrongs in his lifetime and a lot of trauma i did not know about the schizophrenia diagnosis until just this week when his ex gf reached out to me to discuss she was worried and wanted to let me know if i had t been aware and offer resources with the journey his mother my grandmother is a hoarder her house cant be lived in and has been unsafe since i visited for the summer in the s she and my father are horrifically codependent the doctors had to tell her that my father is a grown man and can take carw of himself at the hospital shes outright a narcissist i recall multiple instances where shes going off on my disabled brother for not doing everything to her standards and i jump in to defend him i had to write a handwritten apology because this fucking year old woman got so asshurt that a year old told her to back the fuck off that she stopped showing up to bring food for a month she verbally berates everyone ive had to apologize in public when she goes off on racist rants and in one specific instance i had to call insurance when she keyed another familys car when i was ive cut all contact with her shes the first person ive ever had to do that with she ran the house like it was the military my father is comparatively nicer he has moments where it feels lucid like hes an actual person with feelings but thats only of the time i have vivid memories of chatting with him happily before doing homework and then getting verbally berated only minutes later because i wasnt following his directions to an exact my earliest childhood memory of him was an argument about table manners my brother did not like to bring the fork to his face instead he leaned down to eat and it into him hitting my yo brother and shoving him into the closet door i was too young to process it happening to the degree i know it now just that it felt deeply wrong to witness and something about it was innately backwards i got diagnosed with adhd when i was very young in first grade actually and when my mother told him about the medication i would need to be on he pulled over and walked out of the car yelling that he would never have a kid with r slur here issues hes always spoken to me like im deficient its always felt like i had to do something to earn praise from him currently i am in my s and out of a job i planned to be in college at this point in my life but i cant afford it because the early savings account that we as a family set up got drained for his goddamn mother to fill her house with more useless clothes the parents i live with my mother and stepfather yell at me constantly about getting a job but i keep failing interviews and i dont have enough experience in the field i want to work in because of aforementioned college fund disappearing magically they charge me ridiculous rent that by now has been piling up despite my mother previously promising that she would never do that they will not listen to me when i try to explain that it feels like im just now trying to do the whole growing process again my stepfather has been trying to step in as a father figure which i appreciate i think families are going to be difficult even in healthy nonabusive ones but hes oscillating between threatening to kick me out if i dont get a job in the next few months and saying its out of love i dont know how to feel about it without outright having a panic attack i think im just far too gone to have a proper parental figure suddenly try to introduce themselves and be a part of my life my mother is bordering alcoholism i think its a hereditary thing in the family and my grandfather on her side started this pattern similarly a month ago i had to stay up until am to make sure she got home safe after repeated nights out of drinking and getting high with her friends shes easily impressionable and fell into a bunch of racist conspiracies and homophobia during the lockdown shes a bisexual woman i am a nonbinary lesbian i dont understand how it happened she makes me feel lost it beats the hell that my biological father has raised though dont get me wrong heres the catch i have further job opportunities in the city my biological father lives in but i cant live with him under any circumstances hes had psychotic episodes as recently as despite his treatment for it i just feel defeated and hollow it gets better i know it does i just never knew just how bad everything i didnt know prior to this discovery was i loved my father and wanted to move in before knowing this im at the point where my brothers and my dog and the potential of things suddenly turning around is the only thing keeping me going if i didnt have my dog i dont know what i would do i would like to forgive my parents as long as everything changes but i currently have no faith in it i just dont know what its like having a loving family thank you dad you ruined my fucking life before it even got a chance to start thank you mom for repeatedly acknowledging issues but not solving them
i promise im not an angry person i try my best to be accommodating and understanding of those around me even if its at my own expense and discomfort however lately ive been washed by a title wave of anger triggered by my parents they are divorced my dad has a history of abusing my mother and older brother but calmed down after him and my mother split when i was quite young i am now but hes always been unstable and as of late hes assaulted me along with children that are not his own in public and genuinely deluding himself that he has done no wrong its safe to say i havent been seeing him since incidents and then theres my mum shes more like a full time bully than a mother and it used to make me so fucking depressed and it still does but as i get older it also makes me so angry i get scared every sentence that comes out of her mouth is negative in some way or another she talks in a constant shoutingscreaming voice when shes at home and interrupts me mid sentence so often that ive mostly given up even trying to talk to her she constantly says she hates me that im such a burden and that i make her miserable she insists that she takes control over anything important in my life regarding my independence for years ive tried to communicate with her that the way she speaks to me causes me so much anxiety and anger and anguish but instead of being receptive she blames me for her problems and threatens to make my life miserable for trying to make the household a healthier one i also have type diabetes which is managed with diet and medication without these two things i can die and both my parents give me shit about it constantly and berate me when they have to pay for my medication go to my hospital appointments or when my sugars arent ideal they will never know the constant anxiety i go through regarding my condition and how physically and mentally draining it is to inject myself multiple times a day have to be pedantic about what i eat treat low glucose episodes ectfor them to rub it in my face and tell me i dont know how to care for myself probably makes me more angry than anything i also have a younger special needs brother that needs a lot of support that is also being affected by our parents and i can see he is also slowly getting more and more angry and anxious with whats going on in our family and my heart truely fucking breaks for him if you read all of this then thank you ive had a really shit day and normally id never post something like this but i dont want to burden anyone in my personal life with my shit im not looking for answers i just needed to vent
hi everyone before i get started on anything let me first establish that im still a teenager living with my parents im having difficulty living with my moms rules on what i eat and i dont really know what to do about it anymore ever since my mom has downloaded tiktok shes been altering my familys lifestyle i have nothing against this if my parents see something wrong and want to change it by all means but her rules on eating are quite strange it starts off quite tame like dont eat too much oily food dont eat too much salt etc etc but shes so hellbent on not eating sweets and by sweets its anything with sugar in it like fruits and obviously anything on this list is because shes taking precautions so no one in my family ends up with health conditions diabetes which is fair but its gotten way too far to the point i cant eat anything with an overwhelming sense of guilt coming over me i cant even eat something in front of her without her lashing out on me about how ill get diabetes and itll be my fault ive been skipping meals to avoid the conflict of my mom and her dietary choices the only times id eat would be early morning and before bed when everyone else is in their rooms but i cant help but feel so guilty when i fry an egg and think to myself that im gonna get very sick from eating the oil cooking is one of my hobbies that im very fond of but ive started to let go on cooking since i cant help but think is this what my mom wants it just felt like i was cooking for her and not for myself ive tried talking to her about this in the past but it always jumps to i know whats good for you and ascends into chaos i dont feel comfortable talking to her about this anymore any thoughts on what i could do
i fm just got disciplined like i was my dad got upset because my brother was talking with a slightly raised voice and came out into our living room and started lashing out on us he hit me in the face and scolded me and i fell and then threatened to punch my brother no one said or did anything to antagonize him he just got extremely irate and yesterday he threw his office chair across his office and almost broke it in half and the night before that he snapped his controller in half out of pure rage im absolutely terrified of him and how aggressive he is i feel like im walking on eggshells around him and its genuinely sad he never got caught treating his whole family like this for as long as hes had us
i f am home for the summer from my freshman year of college my parents are not very good at maintaining my privacy and especially like to come into my room unannounced or without asking for the past serveral years my father almost only ever talks to me when it is to tell me to clean the house do schoolwork or something church related they are active mormons i dont believe but have to pretend i do to keep them happy today is my moms birthday several times this summer my father will tell my mother that me and him will do the dishes and clean up after dinner because she worked so hard on cooking it really bugs me when he volunteers me to do work i dont mind cleaning up but i really value my automomy and he rarely ever actually helps too he did so today and i admittedly made a face when he said he and i would clean up after dinner he proceeded to get really offended and get really upset that i wasnt willing to even do this one thing on my mothers birthday ive tried talking to him before about how i feel his love is conditional to how much work i do for him and he laughed he said i didnt mean it and i knew he loved me but he only talks to me to tell me to work and its been going on for years the problem really isnt the cleaning its that every time i bring up how he talks to me solely about things i need to do for him he gets mad and defensive he often also starts listing all the ways he financially supports me which makes me feel guilty i always end up apologizing feeling like im in the wrong and entitled and wishing i had just kept my head down and done the work without comment am i entitled is he just bad at parenting or is this emotionally abusive i really cant tell if im in the wrong for being so hurt about this
i live at home with my dad if you can really even call him that he has depression and probably other issues constantly everyday i dread for the time he is back from work as there is always something he will find to start a huge argument over again if you can call someone shouting at you and telling you that you are useless an argument as i never like to argue cause it will make it worse i am constantly being threatened to be left out on the street with all my belongings i dont do anything to deserve this he was never there for me or my sister when we were kids and it took him getting into a car craqsh and someones child dying to get him to realise he wanted to see his kids i barely knew him until i was i clean up after myself and him often i pay pound per month to him for my shitty room in his council house i recently checked the bills and i pay more than him to live here that bare in mind he only got a bed flat from council because of me living with him his son so we both had a home instead its constant reminders that i am just living here and its all his because it in his name i have had to fend for myself money wise since the day i turned he said youre an adult now you need to provide for yourself he wont even share a pice of toilet roll with me and will hide them from me he often favorites my sister and treats her really nice and takes her out and spends time with her but never would do that with me they sit there and eat steaks and live all happily and im always treated like an outsider i have been struggling ever since and just putting up with the situation as i thought it may get better but it hasnt and i am now and have been putting up with his neglect and emotional abuse and gaslighting since i was and had to move in with him cause my mum couldnt cope with me as a child i have been trying my hardest to work and earn enough to move away from this and can never seem to get any further whenever i do well he will notice and put the rent up i cant afford to move away and get my own space i feel my childhood and teenage years were taken from me due to all the stress he has caused me there is loads i have missed out and im sure no one will understand the extent of emotional abuse because i have memory issues and struggle to articulate things properly so i dont know how to write it all in a way that shows my situation i must have been hitler in my past life to get such a dad i dont know what to do and i see no hope anymore all my friends have heard him how he is and all agree that its not right i often see them with their dads and how their parents care for them and it breaks my heart that for whatever reason i dont get that from my dad i haave nowhere i cqn go my mum lives with her husband in a bed flat i dont have any mates with spare rooms i cant find a girlfriend to live with is there any organisations or charities that will help or am i just unlucky and have to live and hate existing will i ever get my hope back for a happy life
my parents dont think im capable of raising my children on my own im deaf and have chronic illnesses yes but i also have a supportive partner were engaged my partner is capable of supporting us and is fine with renting a place where my kids can live under our roof he has taken my kids out to do stuff when i cant like ice skating driving them around etc however my parents are forcing me to stay here in their house the irony of the situation is that my ex is trying for the same reasons to force the kids to move back in with him and they dont want to i have told the kids repeatedly that i will respect their wishes in this matter if they preferred to be at their dads i would support their decision if they prefer to stay with my parents im fine with that too although we would still rent a place with space for them so they could come and go as they pleased but my parents are saying that im not a good parent im not capable of parenting on my own although i wouldnt be on my own when i am feeling unwell my partner would step up and if they were under my roof i would of course push myself to play an active role i am very depressed living here i hole up in my bedroom which is the same thing my middle child does at her dads for the same reason its not that i dont get along with my parents its that they constantly treat me like a child and then complain when i act like one for the record i have tried very hard to be more of an adult around them but living under their roof causes me to fall back into toxic behavior patterns my body reacts to the stress so im in pain a lot and my mental health is suffering i was trying to endure it because i thought that when the school year began my partner and i would live together in a place of our own so while i was never happy exactly i was trying to maintain a facade of normality now they are telling me that i must only visit my partner but remain here they keep saying that its for the sake of the kids but i am not doing well here and once they said that i immediately lost all motivation to even attempt to be stable im severely depressed and having trouble taking care of myself i know things would not be like this with my partner because weve had long periods of cohabitation and i was much more functional despite various health issues that have cropped up recently i was motivated to get out of bed and take care of myself now that is gone i dont understand how they can possibly think this is good for the children i will never be physically well but when you add severe depression into the mix the result is very bad how can i get them to understand that i want to be free i dont think i will live to be old and i want at least a few years of living apart from them they dont seem to understand that this is driving a wedge between us and that when the kids have graduated i intend to move to alaska full time and go lowcontact as a result of this it feels like a prison a nice one yes but theres a poisonous lack of freedom that is causing me to suffer
i am a f and i have no longer the joy to live i have abusive parents and i dont know if i should endure it till i become or run away to give you and example when i was two boys almost the same age took my toy and mocked me like any kid i went complain to my dad and he said grow up i havent time for this in an anoyed way i insisted cuz it was my fav toy and he got mad and yeeted me back to the sandbox hurting my back when i was i received a fake bird that could fly i asked my parents if when can we go outside so i can play with it they said later and i agreed i waited and days later i asked again my mom snapped with anger for an unknown reason and said break that shit its getting on my nerve my dad her slave as always did it and i was holding my tears up so that my sis doesnt see me crying she was but the worst was at we were in morocco to visit family and me and my cousin where alone with my uncle and he brought us to a strip club and the owner looked at us with a disturbing grin and he and my uncle talked he payed my uncle and my uncle said to us go to the room and wait i will get drink spoiler alert drinks never came but other things yes a guy came in and he started looking at my cousin forgot to tell my uncle had told us to only wear shorts and tight shirts he started to approach my cousin and touched her in inappropriate ways my blood was boiling cuz she was the only one nice to me when he tossed her shorts off while her screaming to not and trying to fight back something snapped in me i remembered my multi gadget had a knife and before i know it he had three holes in the chest and my knife was dirty with this man blood i was panicking but hopefully my cousin made us leave by the emergency exit that wasnt even the last straw my uncle is a pedo and he tried to grop us countless times but every fucking time i complained my parents says you are probably miss interpreted him that how he show loveor hes family and its your fault cover up he even kiss me in the lips multiple times now what doi say to my futer kids oh yeah my first kiss was taken by my uncle i feel like throwing up remembering this and knowing i have no power against it today my parents made us change country again without telling us so no goodbyes to my friends or having a last hang out no for the th time its been a year since i am in this country but they want to change again and that would mess up my studies cuz not all countries have the same education system and diploma they even make all the chores on me cleaning cooking even the lunchboxes for my parents not that it bothers me but they only call me names not even thanks or a smile babysitting my siblings in summer so almost no time to go out except after pm and for a good reason therapist and even if i always talk calmy and nicely they find a reason to snap have to be perfect gradespersonalitieshave a good knowledge and etc so they can flex bank they take my allowance or money from my parttime job my siblings literally come to me first cuz i am the responsible to the point that i dont even see my siblings as siblings but as my kids they always argue honestly i hoped they never married they always call me names never my name to the point that if you call me by my name i will get weird out the only thing stopping me from running away are my siblings but should i or wait till i became or end it all
basically what the top says
father is quite abusive growing up in an indian household im always scared of him giving up everything i liked through my life he forces me to read management and misbehaved with my friends and my cousins he always yells at me and makes me feel uncomfortable claiming i should beg and not study he stopped me from going to another country and im depressed frustrated emotionless and made my mind seeing so many toxic and abusive husbands fathers mothers and families i will be friendless single and childfree for the rest of my life ill be there at my dads birthday and other functions but im going no contact later onwards and ill be away from everyone i need some help in how i can be a bit better at avoiding abuse
i am f and have immigrant parents who are f and m throughout my childhood my mom has been a constant source of hate and anger but i am writing this post because i genuinely do not know if this counts as abuse especially since we are brown and so a lot of this behavior is common in brown households so im gonna give a little insight on some things my mom has done to me while i was under the age of although i dont remember around of the things shes done to me while she somehow remebrs every bad thing ive done so in elementary she took acedmics very seriously and every single day she would make me do extra practice work that would take hours to do and would be above my grade level many many times while doing above grade level ixl with her if i got a question wrong she would take the ipad i was doing it on and hit me repatidly with it on my head also she would scream and scream till i was crying if i made any mistakes one time when i was around so in first grade i got a question wrong and she took a pencil and stabbed my arm with it which made my arm start bleeding also several times if i did something wrong she would grab me by my hair and would drag me across the floor just by my hair which was incredibly painful and scary also when i was around nd grade she would take a cooking tool similar to a wooden rolling pin and would hit me with it which hurts like hell because its huge and wooden throught my childhood if i did anything wrong she would hit me and i would actually be happy if she used her shoes to hit me because they didnt hurt as much also a few times she got so angry that she grabbed onto my arms and clawed at me to the point where my arms were bleeding theese are just a few creative methods shes used to hit my but often she would just slap me despite all this what she did to me phycally wasnt nearly as bad as mentally so ever since i was a little kid my mom can not speak to me or treat me like a normal human being let alone her daughter whenever i ask her a simple question she snaps at me and never speaks in a normal tone this obviously makes me reluctant to talk to her and when i still do our conversations always end in agrumnets she is extremely easy to upset and when she does get angry she spends hours whispering to her self while cooking or upstairs about all the horrible things she wishes would happen to me or my family i can not recall everything she says and she speaks in our native language so its difficult to translate but she usually says something along the lines of how much she wishes we were dead all the truly disgusting and sinister ways she would kill us for emapmple my stomping my head in or kicking and rolling me around and spitting on me or murdering me or kicking me out of the house to live with street dogs all the examples ive just given are extremely tame versions of what she says her whisperings are very graphic and detailed and they make my stomach turn i dont understand how someone can whish such disgusting horrific things on their own children when most people wouldnt wish it on there worst enemy her whispering that she does is still pretty loud so everyone can hear her and its basically her trying to curse us or wish for the worst most gruesome violent things to happen to us she does this several times a day and does this for very very small things theres a lot more insane things shes done this is the tip of the ice berg
so my mom and her boyfriend have been together for about years now and for all ten years theyve argued with each other usually its just an argument about something stupid and nine times out of ten my moms boyfriend is the one to start the argument my mom is a very calm and peaceful person who hates confrontation so she usually tries to walk away from the argument but that only pisses off her boyfriend sometimes to the point where he hits her or puts his hands around her neck now my mom wants to move on and he refuses to leave literally just ten minutes before typing this we nearly had to call the police on him because he kept grabbing her by the arms and not letting her leave the situation and he also put his hands around her neck again my mom isnt the only one he has put his hands on though he has tried to choke me and he has hit my brother i dont hate the guy but he needs mental help for whatever reason he doesnt see any of this as wrong there have been nice times with him but for the most part ive been stressed out over these past ten years im and i dont have the money to move out all i want is some sense of peace for a bit ive spent a large chunk of my childhood stressed out and scared
my mother invited my stepdad back in for the third time hes threatened to kill me my fianc my little brother and my older brother hes put his hands on my mom stolen her car and i dont have the money to leave because my mom wants a month from me and i wash cars ive tried desperately to get another job to no avail my stepdad now wants to step in and threaten to kick us out and she says it wont happen yet when he says something she sits back and lets him if i dont find someplace i might actually break
so the police found out about my dad and the thing is it isnt that bad but the court case cost around k and we dont have that money i wanna go surfing but i had to sell my surfboard to give my dad the money to go even though he is an abuser he still is my dad and im scared he blames me for everything
so i do want to get too into it because the story with my mother is decades long but curious about an outside perspective on my relationship with her currently my mother is homelesson the verge of homeless its been like this for the past years shes made no effort in the past years to get a long term stable job and unfortunately has just squandered away and money she comes across to afford any kind of living situation however with no job this money goes by quick we seem to be on an every months cycle where she texts me asking for more money because she is again about to be homeless this has happened at least times in the past years she claims her various illnesses are what is preventing her from finding a job yet she doesnt take care of herself and is letting these health issues be an excuse for why everything in her life is going wrong and not her fault yesterday i get news that our families dog who unfortunately has been with her in these tumultuous times needed to be put down she was years old black lab she got sick out of the blue and i believe this to be a lack of care from my mother to our dog i just finished college hence why i have not been taking care of the family dog i also suggested that although painful to give up this animal it would be best for her to have a family that could properly take care of her regardless because of a lack of funds on her end i just paid for all the blood work the did on the dog and her euthenization im glad our dog is not in pain anymore but extremely distraught that this situation even had to happen she is again after this just happening yesterday asking me for to pay for her hotel shes been staying at i just cant keep throwing money at her knowing it will never come back i am currently supporting myself and my younger brother as well i always feel guilty for saying no to her but after years of this and an unstable childhood i just cant do it anymore i guess curious if anyone has dealt with a parent like this and what they did to cope tldr my mother has been homeless for years constantly asks me for money to avoid eviction she blames health issues for not working but neglects her own care recently had to put down our dog due to her negligence costing me now she wants for a hotel im supporting myself and my brother and cant keep funding her irresponsibility wondering how others cope with similar situations
this is gonna need some background information so im sorry the post is so long my f boyfriend m and his sister f grew up in a dysfunctional family in which they were fed and given shelter but neglected in terms of emotional neglect exposed to parents arguments and personal issues no family time ignoring mental health educational neglect allowed him to drop out of school made no efforts to encourage study environmental neglect unsanitary surroundings and food handling holes in floors and walls not being fixed not being fed a balanced or healthy diet not having a hygienic environment not taught or encouraged to get a job or higher education how to write a resume essentially most basic skills parents would teach their teensyoung adults losingnot giving him his important documents like birth certificate that he needed in order to get a provisional license passport etc as well as neglect his father is frequently in and out of a job due to him not showing up and so they have him and his sister give them money to buy large amounts of cigarettes they struggle financially already and his sister is also in debt due to this my boyfriend is also diagnosed with asd which impacts his ability to get hired discrimination sensory and social issues as a result of all this he and his sister are reliant on staying with their parents and are not yet able to move out this has created a very depressing solitary environment for my boyfriend as often nobody is awake in the daytime they do not interact unless to ask for money or dump their emotional load onto him and he is held back from pursuing a happy and fulfilled adult life onto what the title says their mother f is diagnosed with schizophrenia which can largely influence her behaviour she regularly refuses to take her medication and as a result will act aggressively say harmful things make unwise financial decisions and they dont know what they can actually do as she is an adult and when they have had to dial did not receive adequate help as their father refuses to step up my boyfriend and his sister take the brunt of this and have to regularly walk on eggshells and act as her caretakers my boyfriend is afraid of leaving home for too long as she has expressed suicidal intent before made threats and he feels personally responsible for her he isnt sure if he can contact social services or if anything exists that would help him to develop skills and find workbecome selfsustaining as an autistic adult which drives him to feeling hopeless and at times suicidal i wanted to ask the adult adults of reddit what can he and his sister actually do in this situation to become independent are there resources available in the uk for this niche situation it pains me seeing him so hopeless he is an incredibly intelligent selfless and capable person who deserves to begin his own life and thrive tldr my boyfriend and his sister were neglected and abused growing up and are struggling to move out for a multitude of reasons boyfriend struggles with autism sister in debt because of parents feeling responsible for mothers mental health and providing for their parents as adults what services or support is available to help my boyfriend and his sister become independent and break free from this toxic household
i f am living at home with my parents m and f when i was younger they were extremely physically and mentally abusive my dad once threw me into a windowsill and knocked me out for being too loud while my friend was over my mom called me a slut and said i looked terrible when my friend did my makeup they say i did not experience a difficult childhood even though we were dirt poor and ive been abused my whole life now for the most part the physical abuse has stopped beyond certain occasions but now they are set to ruin my life i want to go to college to become a vet but they are keeping me trapped here i got into siu carbondale paid for housing registered for classes put in my notice at work everything all i asked them to do was fill out the fafsa so i could get a loan this caused them to take my car to the junkyard refuse to sign anything and scream at me for hours i have done everything i can i tried to get a private loan but was denied because i dont have a cosigner i will never find one i cannot get federal aid without them signing a fafsa refusal letter and i have no way to pay out of pocket i told them i will commit suicide if they dont do this for me and they laughed in my face they do not care about me they just want to leech off of me forever im out of options they have beat me i am seriously considering suicide now because if i cant build a future for myself whats the point i said this to my dad and he agreed i should do it i cant run away i have nowhere to go ive tried everything to get a loan its impossible if you have any advice please let me know i could use anything
tw i talk about suicide and self harm ps i dont think my parents are abusive but i thought it somewhat fit the subject something i just realized is that i think my parents have really messed me up to the point that i dont know what to expect from people anymore i dont know how to expect being treated and i feel like i cant expect that people are there for me because everyone i have ever talked to about the stuff my parents did to me have just said that humans cant bearent perfect i was struggling with intrusive thoughts about killing my little sister i have severe ocd i had struggled every day every single second for a year i stopped liking what i used to like like dancing and i struggled to the point where i couldnt even take care of myself and do basic stuff like shower i walked upstairs to my mom while crying then i asked her to talk to me and come downstairs which i only agreed to after my dad persuaded me to talk to her we got downstairs and she looked at me with a cold face as i sat there crying and sobbing from being terrified and exhausted and she told me why dont you just do it then when i finally tried to kill myself my dad told me that she had said that she felt nothing my dad didnt mean it as a bad thing he thought it was because she was just tired so he said it to me because he thought itd show that she really did love me on the night that i killed myself my mom and dad left me alone at the hospital i was laying there alone devastated and sobbing in the dark for the entire night the one time that night when i tried to call my parents they both got mad because they wanted to sleep and then they hung up i once asked my mom if she loved me because i wasnt sure if she did anymore she said yes but based off of her emotionless tone that was a lie she also didnt say anything more just that simple word yes i know my mom when she did love me when i was younger she wouldve gotten sad that i believed she didnt but now all i was met with was an emotionless voice saying the word yes mechanically when i had tried to kill myself a second time by cutting i eventually gave up and called my dad as i had to get to the doctor to possibly get stitched up and after i had explained the situation to him all he did was complain that he had to drive me to the doctor and so i had to take the bus which is okay im just sad that he didnt care at all when my mom later saw that i had cut myself she didnt react at all she was still as happy and just kept talking like it didnt matter at all one time my dad and i talked and he said that if i ever died he doesnt know if hed cry he has this thing where he doesnt think hes generally able to cry though the things my parents have done to me and the fact that they werent there for me when i needed them the most has created an emotional wound in me that i will have to carry for the rest of my life i look back at the pictures of me and my parents from when i was a kid and even though they are alive it feels like i have lost them like they are gone my mom and my dad who i felt safe with who said that theyd always love me and that nothing i could do would ever change that they arent here anymore and if it could even get any worse i now also dont know what to expect from people when i was only and needed my parents the two people who were supposed to protect me when i was so mentally unwell and so devastated exhausted sad and in need of support and help they werent there instead they started doing and saying some of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me and everyone ive ever told about these things always tells me well your parents probably does love you and that humans are not perfect i just read somewhere about a girl who had had a really bad day as she struggled with her mental health she had talked to her boyfriend about thoughts she was having about self harm and that she was really struggling later that day when they went to bed he asked to have sex with her she wasnt in the mood at all but said yes while they were having sex she suddenly started bleeding from her nose he told her that he could just throw a towel over it and then she could finish off she said that she wasnt in the mood anymore and started crying as she had had a really bad day and were struggling and she was sitting there explaining to him that she wasnt in the mood much in the first place but as shes talking to him he stops her mid sentence and tells her that she put him in a weird position here because he needed to jack off to be able to sleep then he pulled up his phone to watch porn and jack off next to his crying bleeding girlfriend to all of this i thought well i feel bad for her that was not an ideal reaction from him but humans arent perfect that was my reaction it wasnt until after i started reading what others had to say about it that i started realizing how bad he was really treating her and that it wasnt okay now i am genuinely concerned about myself on top of the fact that i have lost my parents and that my mom doesnt love me anymore all of this also seems to have affected me in the way that i dont know what is normal and what is not i dont know what to expect from people or how i should expect that they treat me how can i know when someone is going too far and treating me badly how can i know what is okay and what is not even when i read about what ive written here and about the things my parents have said and done i dont know if i am overreacting and that maybe i am expecting too much from them i dont know all of it feels really hurtful and some part of me thinks it maybe isnt okay but the other part of me remembers that humans arent perfect after all just like everyone has told me all i know is that i clearly have issues with knowing what is okay and what is not and i need to learn myself what is normal behavior from people and what i can expect from them so that i dont get abused or end up in bad situations where should i start and what do i do if anyone has any advice then id love to hear thank you so much for reading

didnt get replies in another sub so here we are essentially my parents are abusive im afraid of getting cps sometimes i feel like their abuse isnt rlly that bad its been ongoing since childhood physical abuse started up again recently mostly emotional they want to kick me out when i turn i have barely any money and am struggling to find a job complex relationship w my parents fear that part of me will no longer be able to continue taking this im please help me will answer questions of all kinds abt the situation need advice or smth to figure out what to do thank you in advance
i am yo female weighing pounds at most i eat fast and i never go for seconds i moved out of my abusive household and into my grandparents home and they are wonderful the only thing that bothers me is grandpa keeps saying things like we eat four meals with you here its like me grandma you and you or i know youre definitely hungry when ever food is mentioned im sure you can finish off what ever left they really dont like left overs but are making way to much for three people to eat i eat just as much as him at a meal and unlike him i dont eat breakfast i dont snack and i dont eat dessert his comments are really bothering me and i truly think he thinks i am eating too much but i almost only eat one meal a day and dont always finish that meal so idk why he is being so rude he is also really pushy at trying to get me to eat any left overs i dont know how to respond but its pissing me off it doesnt help that i have been having issues with bloating and gas lately it makes me angry and i want to cry i have never had issues with them outside of this idk what to do but i told him today i dont eat that much and he basically told me i was lying and he thinks otherwise in somewhat of a joking manner at first i thought it was teasing but now i know its not besides he is probably at the least with a dad bod so i feel like he is not in a place to judge me a nearly anorexic teen that still wears smalls and mediums i dont want to be mean but i dont want to push this off cause i know it could escalate to a point that hurts me forever how do i handle it my first thought is to stop eating and leave the room when ever he does that but i feel like thats passive aggressive of me my other thought was to just stop eating like i was before i moved but that led to a lot of health problems probably why i am bloating and having a hard time digesting now that i am eating regularlyish the only thing i can think of that i do wrong when i eat is that i eat really fast growing up i just ate fast we often ate in the car headed some where or right before leaving or going to bed its always been a rush to finish our food so its really hard to eat slow ps this is not the parents of my abusive mother these are the parents of my nonabusive step father
a lot of messed up stuff happened in my childhood definitely things that should have never happened i was always confused on whether my mom liked me or not shed say such cruel things to me and in the next breath act like were best friends shed make fun of the way i looked then copy my style shed act weird when i hang out with my stepdad and get jealous of me i never knew what was true with her and what wasnt i truly knew she didnt care about me after i told her about the weird stuff my step dad did he kept pushing taboo topics and frankly disgusting sexual ideas towards me luckily he never did anything physical to me but that didnt make it any less messed up i told my mother and she humiliated me in front of everyone then got mad at me she stayed married to that man for years after i turned and moved out it wasnt until recently she messaged me telling me that she believes what i said and is divorcing him this all happened because he was secretly drugging her since i left he also admitted to at least some of the weird stuff he said to me after that i tried to reconnect with my mother but it didnt work out she would bring up memories like they were happy occasions but i remembered it as exactly the opposite i would see old glimpses of the woman i wasnt convinced and even like me it was like she was desperately trying to pretend like everything was okay when it wasnt after all that i wonder if i could ever really forgive her or trust her im not really sure if she ever cared about me i was always her least favorite child
i dont even know if shes abusive or not but as a girl being around my own mother has affected the way i socialize with other women she neglected me when i was born and my aunt was the one who raised me she was more of a mother to me than she was anytime i talk to her she yells at me and uses verbal abuse when i try to communicate ive been told that i should respect her and that i should ignore her but how can i respect someone whos been so awful to me she acts nice to me only when she wants to be her new relationship with her boyfriend has turned her into a worse person shes obsessed and she choose him over my sister and i this hurts so much i keep hoping that my mom will change and she will become a better person and i didnt realize i had been hoping for this for years this has been such an on going loop i feel like i should hate her but i never could because shes my mom i cant even move out because i dont have a source i feel abandoned by her almost whenever i text her all she does is fight me and she blocks me i feel awful i feel desensitized towards her mistreatment towards me i dont know what to think of this
something that makes me want to scream at people nowadays is how they think cartoons like the secret of nimh was traumatizing and they are only know realizing this or how they are so hardcore because they watched faces of death traumatizing is having your mother put on porn to watch with you at and up traumatizing is knowing if the day was going to be good or bad if she watched her brotheryour uncles crime scene video and having his corpse in a red mustang burned into your memory please start teaching your kids the difference between reality and fantasy and for the love of all that is holy and unholy please never watch porn with your kids
i had a fight with my mom and she kicked me out told me she never wanted to see me again and many more nasty things i didnt say a word to her i have too much respect for her to say something back i picked up my bags and left i didnt want to speak to her and the first thing she asked me through my dad was if i wanted to go to disney with her not sorry not a hello not a hi nothing just if i wanted to go with her somewhere after not speaking to her for almost two months now what could that mean that her only way of saying sorry was through money i obviously said no but it hurt
ive always felt like i was kind of weird i want to say that i felt like i was different but that would be a lie because i feel like everyone is unique so weird would be the word to describe me growing up i was surrounded by family but not in the way you might expect during those times my mom and dad would fight constantly and i tried acting very unbothered thinking it didnt affect me because i wanted to be strong my parents and i moved into a house in miami and my aunt who was in high school was living with us at the moment my aunt was very smart she was very brave for coming to miami without her mom and dad in order to get a better education here but she was constantly fighting with her dad later on my moms side of the family all came to move into our home from honduras it was chaos i felt like i was watching a war everyone fought my mom and my dad fought my mom and my aunt fought my grandpa and my grandma fought my uncle and my aunt fought it was exhausting at times and the way i would cope would be to daydream i loved to daydream it felt like i was in my own little world away from everyone it would sort of be my safe space where no one was able to touch me and where i wouldnt hear anyone my mom kicked out my grandpa and eventually everyone started to leave i sort of felt relieved but also felt alone i was always surrounded by people and even though they were fighting it was comforting to have everyone together since they were gone my parents shifted their focus onto me and my sister my mom holds a lot of anger in her and to be honest i cant blame her the things i heard about what she went through ate away at me but she was very harsh with me sometimes and i learned not to share personal things or do anything to give her a reason to yell her words cut better than any knife when i was younger i would text my friends and sometimes i would talk about my mom which was almost never and i mentioned how i thought she was scary she checked my phone one day and looked through everything and saw that i said that about her she was furious i meant no harm in saying that it was just she always yelled i was oblivious when i was in the fifth grade she screamed at me terribly i remember she asked me what are their parents going to think im abusing you am i abusing you i stopped talking about her after that i never felt like i was close with her what was the point
so to start this fiasco i woke up one morning and immediately my abdomen was burning and felt super painful i had nothing the night before in terms of pain and no history of this ever happening theres is however a history of appendicitis in my family i tried standing up to go to the bathroom but i couldnt even stand up straight i went to my moms room and told her hey i think i need to go to the hospital her response nope wait an hour so im sitting there on the couch in pain and feeling awful and shes just sitting there pretending nothing is happening she then keeps asking me to rate my pain i keep the numbers low only because in the past when i have told her about me being in real pain she flips her shit and loses her mind she then goes on to tell me how she has a migraine and how i should pity her and just shut up and deal with it an hour later im still in pain and she angrly decides im going to go to urgent care to prove her right so while were driving to urgent care im in the back trying to stay as still as possible to minimize the pain because its really bad and she sees that and hits every speed bump possible making it so by the time we were actually at urgent care i felt even worse we get in and the doctor sees me and is immediately like yeah she should really go to the hospital like right now and my mom sends me out of the room and i can here her telling the doctor oh shes lying shes not sick just tell her she should go home and thank god the doctor stood up to her and said this isnt a game her life could really be at risk do you want that on your conscious so we drive to the hospital and the whole time shes telling me that im being so self absorbed for picking today to be sick and that im doing this to hurt her and clearly this is a psychological problem with me we get to the hospital and she watches me get checked in then fucking dips out of there she then calls my neighbor and asks her to watch over me and leaves the entire state not even joking the doctors try to figure out whats wrong they cant in the er and they tell my to schedule somthing with my primary so my neighbor brings me home to which i discovered that she left entirely and i had no food i then get a text later on that night and she rants about how her migraine was probably worse then any pain i had and then she dodges all my calls and refuses to give me a date when shell be back as for my health i dont give a shit anymore i havent taken any of the medicine and im not schedulling an appointment im pretty uncaring of my life anymore and whether i live or die so i dont care if i drop dead from this honestly i hope it happens one so i can be free of this nightmare of a life i have and so that they can finally see i wasnt faking it
the title is the tldr really this last christmas i had a huge fight with mainly my mother and one of my sisters it ended in crying screaming throwing stuff the whole thing i ended up leaving in the middle of the night on christmas eve after that i decided that this is it im done after all i moved away from home a while ago and i have a stable job so i just went completely nc with my parents but ever since then ive just felt empty it just feels like im all alone and like no one cares and that ive got no support system even though its not like my parents were much of a support system theres one thing my mother said that night that plays over and over in my mind she said if im not there for you who else is gonna be and for some reason it feels like she was right thanks for reading i really just wanted to get this off my chest
does anyone else find themselves attaching to women older than you typically who show you any amount of care or love simple as a hug or a pat on the back then you start to think of them as mother figures wishing they were your mother instead and getting jealous of them having children because at least those kids have someone to nurture them and love them im embarrassed by it and feel like its wrong but i cant stop
please ignore anything grammar mistakes because english isnt my first language and i dont have a great vocabulary i f have a dad thats around early mid s ever since i could remember my dad has always hit me for some kind of reason god bless my mommy she never hit me just yelled at mei dont remember most of them because i was very young but ill tell you the ones i do remember when i was around years old i wanted to make some noodles to eat i made some but i forgot the pot was still hot and like a dumb kid i didnt use cloth to hold it i was walking towards the kitchen table when i truly realized how hot it was so i ended up dropping pot with all the noodles my dad happened to see that and lucky for him he had his belt on him you know what happened next the hitting has stopped for now but hes still mentally abusive i remember it so vividly i was playing a game on my ipad when i hear him call my name so i go downstairs to see what he wants from me go to the dishes ugh this house must be a pigs farm i got a lil annoyed at the pig joke so i ended making a little annoyed face unfortunately for me he was right next to me while i was doing the dishes he tells me to look at him with a slight annoyance and i look at him why are u mad for stop making that face he rises his voice at me and like my usual reaction i say this is how i always look and my dad goes how dare you talk back to me and slaps me i apologized and said ill fix my face so i smiled another similar situation happened but that time instead of slapping me he takes out a charging wire and starts hitting me that was few months ago recently he started a truck job where he has to travel through states in north america few weeks ago he called asking why i dont call himlike shouldnt it be obviousi ended up telling him i forgot and stuff hes usually out for weeks and goes back to work in a few days last time he came home i was sleepingpm and he calls me downstairs to clean the kitchen and do the dishes he starts with his commenting again saying all that pig house stuff and how i as a women should be taking care of the house blah blah blah blah i tuned him out because i was so tired of his nonsense he was saying all that while in the kitchen with me so when he left i start silently sobbing because i am still traumatized by him i am afraid to stand up to him because hes the man of the house crap he recently started drinking too so i dont know how much i have until he starts physically abusing me again i wish i could beat you again his words to me every once in a while
hello i dont live with my family anymore but i still live in the same city they still try to control and abuse me i dont know how to get away from them ive exhausted all options eg police refuges etc
today i lost control at home and screamed at my mom while she acted like a kid at my stepfather then to take over control over the argument she just says that i shoulda been born on another belly i dont know what to feel or do right now at home
your parents raise you differently than they raise your little sister my sis and i are years apart im older im shes my dad locked me in the basement always got mad at me in every argument between my sister and i and yelled at me when both me and my sister were not cleaning our room correctly did he scream at her or lock her in the basement nope never my mom and dad dont get along btw and my sister said she hates me and wishes i never existed she has left welt marks on me and ive left none on her but i get yelled at for pestering herleading her on when i didnt but like theres a name for it when parents raise the siblings differently and it causes issues in the siblings relationship with eachother do i want my little sister in my life when i move out no i hate her i wish she wasnt born because ive tried so many times to mend our relationship as we are teenagers im sick of her and her rotten attitude that shes better than me my dad also tells me multiple times that im just like his older brother his older brother was mentally and physically abusive to him am i just not selfaware idk but my mom said i am not like his older brother that my dad hates my dad hates me lowk
i joined this subreddit not even hours ago and i just feel so fucking defeated everything kind of just sucks and i need a place to just ramble and hopefully ill feel better in the end i dont think my sister is in this subreddit or is even aware of its existence and i really dont want to make a throwaway so if youre my sister dont read this because im not involving you in this shit show growing up my sister well call her ruth was and probably still is my dads favorite shes years older than me and was developmentally delayed to an extent ruth has auditory processing disorder which is basically like dyslexia for hearing she cant focus on one sound with a bunch of background noise so if youre talking to her in an area with a lot of noise pollution its hard for her to understand the first go around my sister was born in and the auditory processing disorder diagnosis came about in shes the oldest so my parents were freaked out when ruth wasnt developing the way a normal child with no disabilities would she couldnt hear my parents talk to her half the time so her speech was delayed before the diagnosis my parents thought she would grow up to be put in a group home for adults this never happened because they figured out the issue and there was a treatment plan in place to help her through catching up with development and help her succeed in school she turns this year and im very proud of being her brother with all the hurdles shes gone through with her auditory processing for as long as i can remember ive always felt like i wasnt good enough for my dad nothing i did was good enough even at years old and dealing with bullying from girls at school because i was born a girl transitioning when i was and i didnt fit the image of what the other girls wanted me to be i got bullied a lot for things of that nature at school and my sister also was bullied to some degree because of her disorder she was always coddled by my dad and i would get scolded there was an instance of me being a kid and doing what kids do my dad getting mad and picking me up and slamming against a closet door to yell in my face when he let me down i ran and hid in the pantry he called my mom sobbing and telling her he went too far my mom didnt know what exactly had happened until i had told her years later it didnt get better from there because around or i told my mom i wanted my dad dead i never had a good relationship with death growing up because the finality of it all scared me and still does if there were something serious that needed to be talked about i always asked first if it was about death all i knew about death at that point is that its the one thing that you cant come back from and if youre dead the person can no longer harm you and thats basically what it was i didnt describe how i wanted him dead i just wanted him dead so he wouldnt hurt me anymore terrified my mom put me and my dad in therapy and i dont really remember much about going through that it didnt fully fix things but it healed them enough that i no longer would say that i wanted him dead dont get me wrong my mom and ruth were also victims to my dads abuse i just got the worst of it all ruth got slaps in the wrist compared to me and my mom we werent raised religious parents were both lapsed in their respective faith backgrounds so ruth and i were always and still are interested in learning about different religions we learned a lot about judaism since my aunt and my cousin on my moms side are jewish from how my grandparents raised them but never a lot about christianity my dad has religious trauma from the religion and hated the notion of us even learning about god or jesus or literally anything that had to do with the religion we were unfortunately fans of a prominent christian family shown on tlc and my dad hated that we watched the show my sister had dated a boy in middle school who was catholic and my dad drilled into her about why she would want to convert to catholicism when she was thats the kind of things ruth would get meanwhile i would get yelled at if i missed a goal during a soccer game dropped a fly ball in softball made any small mistake that a kid makes etc i was constantly trying to be better for my dad and i couldnt never meet the high bar he had for me my parents divorced in but the start of it happened in when my dad was laid off from his job he fucked us over financially because he never tried to get a good job again he would get min wage jobs and get fired because he called off too much he didnt give a shit while my mom bent over backwards to make sure we survived i wont get into every detail of why he is the way he is but it boils down to hes never been allowed to hit rock bottom hes always had something there to catch him before he hits the ground during them trying to work things out and not divorce there was a time that my dad was screaming in my moms face calling her every nasty name in the book in the kitchen with me in the family room not even ft away and fully able to hear everything i was on the computer and i wanted to escape to my room but i remember thinking i couldnt because if i did my dad would bring me into the crossfires and use me against my mom in the house they bought in was foreclosed on and my mom and i moved about ish minutes to a different state and city ruth had just graduated high school and i had just finished freshman year i was furious that i was being ripped from everything i knew and blamed it on my mom when looking back its really my dads fault i was an awful kid for sophomore and junior year just very short mean and rude to my mom and i regret it every day how bad i was was also the year i went nc with my dad the first time after various situations that happened around my birthday one that ill talk about later i went nc after my dad told me he wanted to see ruth off to college after thanksgiving and threw in my face how i wanted to see my then boyfriend on the day we usually see each other the only good thing i can give to my ex is that hes the reason why i got the guts to even go nc the first time ex was also not great it wouldve turned abusive had the relationship continued but thats the one redeeming quality i can say about him i didnt speak to my dad for years over that time my dad would lash out at my mom still telling her that shes feeding me lies about him so i dont talk to him eventually he seemed to get better hes an alcoholic if he drank he drank heavily and he stopped drinking at some point during that time i personally do not drink because of the things that occurred when he was drunk it wasnt much except he was incredibly scary and was more prone to yelling at people while intoxicated he also went into therapy and started actually doing better during this time as well my mom went through a cancer diagnosis to which she has survived and been declared in remission my junior year at one point i saved her life after she collapsed from severe dehydration graduated high school had to move unexpectedly a month after graduation went through trade school and got my hair license transitioned and started hrt found out the day after i got my license that we were being evicted my mom and i were homeless for months and we finally got back on our feet by the time i started speaking to my dad again i recognize that im dependent on my mom still am as i live with her but we are the only ones we can depend on my aunt doesnt live in the same state and my cousin lives overseas during this period ruth was away at college so she couldnt do much to help either we only had each other its been me and her against the world since weve struggled financially over the years but we always seem to make it work in march about two months before ruth graduated from college my dad and i met in a public place with my mom nearby to talk about everything that went on up until that point from what i remember a lot of the things i said to my dad were things he never considered and he seemed to take things to heart and wanted to change this was the first of times he has apologized to me things got better somewhat but rome wasnt built in a day and neither do fixing strained relationships between a parent and child for about a year after this i tried initiating conversations about the past in gentle ways every time he would freeze up and get very silent and i would feel like i had to change the subject every time he never once tried talking to me about things whenever i brought them up and after a while i just stopped in i went nc a second time because he was hoenstly being a fucking dick over a car he had ownership over i had gotten a car the previous august and it was a stupid purchase if only because i spent what i paid for in car payments in repairs as well during the first year alone he tried telling me not to do something with it i dont remember what and i told him not to contact me until i reached it to him this lasted months we met in a public place again with my mom and this time his girlfriend and talked things out again this is the second time hes ever apologized to me a common theme of all this is im not a priority to my dad my dad can talk about the trauma he went through growing up the trauma he caused my mom and assumedly my sister we dont talk about our dad in that way im not putting ruth in the middle of all this and she is the type to want to find a solution even if there is none apologize to my mom on numerous occasions often unprompted but i can count on one hand how many times hes apologized to me the third time happened last year out of the blue where he called me crying about how he feels bad for ruining our relationship for the years we didnt speak and he wanted to make things right i felt it was genuine and i had thought this was opening a door to future discussions it did not obviously since im here writing this post the weekend of mothers day my dad sent me and ruth several screenshots of a trauma dump he did on a social media site i didnt read any of it frankly it pisses me off still that he even dumped that on us out of the blue not even considering the circumstances and i ignored the conversation he and ruth had about it i vented to my mom about it saying that it hurt that he can just dump his trauma on me but i cant do the same for the trauma he caused me later that evening my dad texted my mom and apologized for the millionth time for a situation she doesnt even remember she told my dad he shouldnt be apologizing to her as he has numerous times in the past already and that he should really apologize to me there was a little back and forth and eventually my dad texts me the next day asking what my mom meant so i told him i told him how ive never felt like i was a priority to him how i wasnt even on the list of people to make amends with how i never felt good enough for him no matter what i did and how i had to basically coddle him talking about this in the past i told him how it hurt knowing that hes apologized to my mom so many times yet i can count on three fingers the times hes apologized to me i told him it feels shitty to see him be open about his own trauma but i cant do the same to him eventually i mentioned how i knew ruth had always been his favorite that is what set him off he told me that he didnt have a favorite child it was a bullshit statement and that he no longer wanted to have this conversation over text i said i would only meet with him if my mom could be there to mediate because im not trusting him to do this alone he agreed told me to pick a time and place and we would meet he even texted my mom saying he understood why i wanted her there and thought it was a good idea the next day i decided on a park in the city i finished high school in we have an elderly dog with anxiety and it would be easier to do that than to find a sitter and texted him asking if that park was okay at this time he messages me back to ask why that park i asked why does it matter you told me to pick a place and i did he sends back well the last time we were meant to meet at this park you stood me up this is the situation i alluded to earlier because during this time i wasnt the best my mom had taken my phone away i had either just turned or about to and there was a rally for a tax levee that the marching band was playing at the rally was at the park i chose my dad was meant to pick me up from the park so we could go celebrate my birthday the city i graduated hs from is very small i lived right behind the high school and i could get to this park in minutes if not faster when i couldnt find my dad and having no way of getting into contact with him i figured i would walk home and if he couldnt find me at the park he would assume the same he didnt instead he called to yell at my mom blaming her for why he couldnt find me and how shitty she is then yelled at me in the car once i got in i was a sophomore in hs at this point or nearly there i was a kid i didnt stand up my dad on purpose things went back and forth from there i told him hes holding a grudge for over years at this point that i also have bad memories with this park hs ex broke up with me at this park in the worst and cold hearted way and that i didnt choose this park as a malicious attack against him i honestly chose the park because its small i know the park well enough that in the event one of us gets lost it would be easy to find each other its a fucking park he didnt put any stipulation on where it could be so i chose that park he told me he doesnt feel comfortable meeting at this park because i stood him up and tried using my bad memories as a gotcha on why we should change locations i stood firm telling him that this is an uncomfortable situation and he should feel uncomfortable i said we are doing this by my terms we are meeting at this park or its not happening at all he throws back okay we can do it at the park but your mom cant be there i said no we are doing this on my terms or not at all i stood firm on this even going as far as threatening to go nc again if he didnt meet me where i stood ill be honest i only said it as a scare tactic because hes admitted to my mom hes scared of me going nc again except he didnt blink at the threat just kept going on about how im being unreasonable and he isnt responsible for the stories i make about him in my head basically calling me delusional so i told him not to contact me again i blocked him everywhere including his number i messaged his girlfriend to inform her of the situation telling her if he tries to contact me through her i will block her as well since then its been hell i have a laundry list of medical issues a lot of them being nerve issues i had carpal tunnel at and got surgery for it while in hair school ive known the whole time ive been cutting hair im doing so on borrowed time and this year i started college to get a degree for when i can no longer do hair my hands started being an issue again in march i figured its because i take handwritten notes and i cut hair and itll go away once the semester ends it didnt it only got worse weeks after the end of the semester my right wrist started hurting but didnt impede on my work until a week later when i had to leave work to go to urgent care because the pain was too much for me to cut hair i tried cutting hair again the next day same thing and again it happened the day before i saw ortho xrays looked fine so i was ordered an mri that didnt happen until about weeks ago mri doesnt show anything except normal wear and tear and my only next step is to get an emg a nerve test if thats inconclusive im shit out of luck because it hurts to cut hair my hours at work have been cut significantly i can only reception work on the weekends so ive received a hour cut plus the tips id normally get to help beef up my paycheck arent there ive already been struggling keeping my head above water since january of this year and right before my current round of medical issues i was almost in the clear my pay has been cut to if that of my normal weekly take home i dont qualify for help through united way the things i need help paying car payment for a car i purchased after the lemon i had loans and credit cards arent listed as options my mom is lucky to work for a fantastic hospital and covers the majority of our bills but shes getting a total shoulder replacement she does have short term through her employer so at least theres that i dont know what to do anymore im trying to find a job but nobody will call me back for an interview i keep getting rejection after rejection the one interview ive had didnt hire me though that manager is trying to get me hired at a different store but who knows i have bills to pay and im only getting a fraction of what i normally get im home all the time and i feel so fucking helpless im reaching my fucking limit on what i can handle nothing good has happened to me since going nc i feel worthless and stupid i feel like im annoying all my friends because i have too much time i really dont know what to do i dont even know what can be done at this point im lucky i still have health insurance through my job and i need good health insurance with the amount of medical issues i have im scared every day and i feel like im going to throw up constantly my appetite is shit ill go hours without eating and only do so when my blood sugar drops low enough my cgm alerts me of it if i do eat i have to eat my safe foods because i will go through making something only to sit down maybe take a bite or two before my body decides that it doesnt want that my sleep is shit even worse than during the semester i feel like im on the verge of a panic attack constantly and i dont want to burden my friends when they have their own shit ive asked for help from friends and family and only people and have come my way i dont know anymore i feel like im being punished for cutting out my dad again i know im not its just a coincidence but i cant help but feel that way everything was fine for a week after the semester ended to this all starting nothing bad happened until i went nc i wonder if things would get better if i reached out but i know it will only cause me more stress i feel like im drowning and everyone is watching and not helping thanks for reading if you do be kind to one another
ik many people may have this problem but why dose my father just throw things at me and act like he never did
so i noticed my dad does this thing where he will listen to my conversations with my sister mom etc and i obviously wont know it can be something as simple as my sister and i talking about my door sagging and my sister saying someone should fix it this happened weeeeks ago a very unimportant comment in my opinion today my sister lazily closed my door according to my dad so the door made an awful noise when it hit the ground my dad said something along the lines of i heard you say it should be fixed but you can just lift the door dont be fuckin lazy this time his remark was more tame but there have been multiple times in the past where he will bring something up and sort of use it against me without me knowing he knew about it it will mostly be conversations i sometimes feel betrayed by this am i overreacting i feel like i have ptsd and am easily triggered i have been feeling more sensitive since attending therapy and while i have progressed a lot in the past year i feel like i have a long way to go the fact that im easily triggered makes me feel like im going backwards but my therapist says it might be because im surpassing things and setting boundaries so it opens up some past trauma
im going to be short i have parents who abused me when i was little they liked me to participate in their sexual acts first as a spectator and collaborator in certain acts such as cleaning my fathers genitals with a stocking or inflating used condoms the most thing they made me do was clean my father with my mouth they laughed and so did i i was little and i didnt really understand what happened until i was eleven years old all my life they denied what happened to the point of making me doubt myself but they continued their abuse mocking me hitting me and humiliating me in every way possible typical narcissists as an adult when they were divorced my mother kicked me out of the house and it was only then that i was able to get away from them and have contact today i am married marriage in trouble and with a yearold son who is the best thing in the world my wife does not believe what happened to me perhaps because i never gave her specific details it is difficult for me to give them he was very small and those games with my parents were not traumatic events like my mothers beatings were for example but the fact is that i am firm that if it happens and she says that my parents do not seem like the kind of person who would do that as if they were carrying a sign that says im a pedophile my problem yesterday i fooled myself that i was going to take our son to his night job and then with her to a friends house and in reality he was at my mothers house i hate her for that as soon as i found out we argued i still havent seen in person at the time of writing this i love her with all my soul and it makes me cry to have to abandon her but i dont see any other way out although if i stopped being close to him maybe my son would be more at risk what should i do
hello upon reading some post here most are relatable to my family and my background im years old i work as a call representative full time i learned to drive on my own because my dad was physically abusive to me as a teenager he would punch me in the face and spray coke soda on my face he would turn off the lights and internet to prevent me from submitting my homework i believe this is what started my cycle of just giving up things i start my mom has pulled my hair called me ugly bruised me and told me to kill myself at years old i want to move out i want to go back to school for the sciences not for them but for me the thing is i dont know what i want to do for school when i went to community to figure it out my dad punched me in the face during it so i withdrew i know that i cant enter school while living in an abusive home but i want to leave i want to move on what advice would you provide on an escape safe plan with the goals i have thank you for any upcoming advice and for those experiencing the same i havent gone out of the situation yet but know you arent alone and theres a way out keep going and dream big dont let your parents limit you and break the cycle

i and my younger sisters experience daily emotional and physical abuse from my mother i dont know what to do even today my back got whooped with wire only because i didnt wanted to go to store everyday my mother reminds me of how much of a mess i am and without me i would die my feelings and opinions disregarded she tells me to kill myself if i dont like something in house she would constantly remind me of how whore i am and all i can do is please men even though i never had friendsmainly because she shit my friends behind their back and would always tell me to stop talking to them or else she will break my face or phone she would make fun of me and call me r word for having obvious autistic behaviour i cant draw or have any hobbies because what i do is always pointless and will only slow me down she threatened me that she will break my hands if i keep drawing she would remind me how much i look like my father i hate my father she throws at me heavy things or even worse knifes she would whoop my back if i do something bad like disagree with her she would beat me even in public and this whole stuff happens to my siblings too i feel like its going to be only worse as time passes i actually consider harminh myself and i lost all my motivation because of her i cant call cps because none of them will take the problem seriously my father is abusive too hes not the type of person who would help or love no relatives will take care of us im scared for my little sisters and myself i cant do anything i want normal life but idk how to get it without being left with no home and money to survive

hello this is my second time posting on reddit and im still not sure if im doing anything wrong but basically my dad has been very emotionally and physically abusive towards me and my mother though i have a younger brother me and my mum are always protecting him from my dads aggression and beatings im and am gonna be in less than a year and i could leave this situation then and live with friends but i want to leave with my mum and little brother i cant leave them behind my mum has been with him for over years tho and i believe shes been manipulated throughout their relationship to believe there isnt any help out there for us so she doesnt really feel like we should and obviously shes scared of him too i forgot to mention but hes really bad especially when hes drunk but honestly it seems like hes never sober now hes drinking everyday so its been a rough couple of weeks onto the part about leaving though im not sure if womens shelters would take us all as i am nearly an adult and idk if we could stay long term until we can find somewhere to live but i just want out i cant deal with this anymore i live in england if that helps with your advice ive spoken to my mum a few times recently past few months about this but nothing ive said really gets her to understand we would be better without him so please if you have any advice for services i can talk to which dont contact the police instantly please comment i want to be sure theres a plan in place before doing anything because i want us to be safe before anything

i went out to my friends bday party and i came home at a reasonable time pm and my dad was so mad i am and he is telling me i have to ask him for permission whenever im going out and everytime i come back from somewhere fun with my friends they ruin my mood at the ride back home i am so tired of being depressed at home i wanna be happy i hate my parents he is punishing me for going out by making me wake up at am to cook breakfast for everyone i feel like a maid in my own house i havent even properly got time to sleep
my relationship with my father has been complicated hes told me before that if any other parent had to deal with me they wouldve left a long time ago lately hes been telling me how he hates his life and how he doesnt get anything out of going to work and providing for everyone not just with him but with my mom as well i feel like a trauma dump for both of them both of them complain to me over and over again not only about each other but about their own upbringings even after i got sent to a psych ward due to self harming they didnt bother to even try to change one bit but back to my main point my dad told me not to be surprised if he drives himself off a cliff and even went as far as to ask me if id forgive him if he killed himself so im really worried about him now and if he does do it its gonna be my fault and im gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life earlier today he was yelling at me for not sleeping with my exit was my first relationship so i wanted to take it slow but thats a whole other topicand he said that its my fault she left me then he went on to talk about how sex should be my number one priority as an year old boy at that point i just broke down crying to which he started yelling at me asking me why i was crying and threaten to leave for good if i dont tell him why he didnt seem to have even an ounce of sympathy a couple days later when i told him that she broke up with me i got yelled at like times even when i asked him to leave me alone multiple times he just kept continuing to yell and yell at me he went on to tell me that its all my fault because i didnt sleep with her he then went on to tell me yelling how women only want two things sex and money and when i dont listen to him he again threatens to leave the family and take everything away i feel like im watching my whole family fall apart and theres nothing i can do about it if you read my last post you know my family isnt really a family i just want all of this to end all i wanted was i dont know a hug from my father that wouldve been nice maybe for him to not yell at me when i need his support the most a couple weeks ago he told me about how if he was like everyone else he wouldve disowned me a long time ago i feel so alone not even my own family cares about me it seems like ive been considering another suicide attempt and im really scared
im yrs old live in the ph and i think its time for me to voice out about what my parents did to me mom currently threw a plastic plate in my head which resulted to gush out a lotta blood i only stopped the bleeding when i finally apply cloth to it the worst part is my lil sis witnessed this whole situation it would be really traumatic for her despite not really knowing whats going on ofc this includes myself as im crying and panicking a lot when it bled i wouldve gotten stitched my head but i dont really have enough money for it so its really difficult physically im dealing with a headaches fatigue bruise and swelling mostly at my head injury and mentally i am dissociating depressed and confused i only got checked up publicly so since i cant get it stitched i drink a lot of antibiotics and painkillers its what the doctor prescribed to me however the healing process wont be fast i know i wont get a job for a while bc of my head injury i dont wanna think too much as this triggers me more headaches anyways back to what my parents did they were ashamed of what they did but i fear they might do this again since in their minds i believe they have some sort of generational trauma where abuse was tolerated and wont really realize that its fully wrong mentally they also emotionally abused me a lot and i havent responded to them nicely which yeah resulted to put myself in a dangerous situation i wouldve report them to the authorities but i have the fear of them going to prison i only want them to realize that its wrong i dont want their lifetime to be spent in prison i dont want gossips to be heard all over by my neighbors or my relatives coz yeah that would be really stressful for me and my lil sis so i just had to make excuses about the cause of my head injury like i got tripped at the corner when thats not rlly the cause i know kind of pains me currently shes taking care of my wound which is expected because its my moms fault but its kinda really boring to stay here at bed for the whole day and when i get better im looking forward to get out because its dangerous to put myself and my lil sis here for too long its not always theyd do something this physically abusive but yeah i always fear it gets there due to their lack of emotional managementintelligence and about my dad he was not there when this situation happened since hes currently working ofc it is frustrating for him to witness this but it seems like hes not really taking this as a big deal so ill say that dad hasnt been the greatest dad himself hes got a past history where he hurts my mom and is a massive cheater this family is just messed up and i dont know what to do except to escape outta here
so my mother is now a bit older and i just got years old male i think i have been verbally emotionally and physically abused for my i dont know whole life one of my problems is that i dont see how i can get out of this situation and the other is that i feel great shame and guilt i always ask myself if i was better would it be that bad to state some things that she did for context once when i was years old i wanted to go with a friend girl of mine which i really loved and cared for for a outdoorpool to just hang out a bit with her and some other friends of our class my mother had a little nap i had to wake her up so she lets me out of the house because back then if i didnt tell my mother i would go outside she wouldnt let me in till we would clash again for an hour so i woke her up to tell her i go outside she then bashed out screaming loud asf and then took a knife and rushed at me i fell backwards on my back running from here and hit my head ouch and started crying really hard because i really got scared dude i really thought i was about to die and that that was it this was the first time she rushed at me with a knife and where i got hella scared there were many other times she did it where she said shed kill me and stuff but i kinda got used to it over time so i wasnt scared anymore that much she verbally abused me my whole life told me i was shit that i was dumb that i cant sit still ihave diagnosed adhd but she doesnt give a shit cant behave that i should fuck my self even at a young age there were thousand different things she told me and the thing is that i dont give a shit about it no more she still slurs at me to this day when i think about it it scares me that i dont care do you guys get that feeling i told my new gf about this topic with my mom and she was so surprised and stuff and told me that she couldnt imagine that i was kinda confused because i didnt think its a big deal to that point i knew i was getting abused but was it really that bad i was asking myself i was reassuring myself that this happens also to other etc she bite me multiple times literally it kinda hurt and i was confused and scared i was kinda young i cant wear the things i want and if so i have to go through a big conversation at years old bruh she forced me to go to school and be a doctor lmao the normal thing immigrant parents do well now im starting with university but im studying history and philosophy for the start i might switch up some things literature interest me as an example my mother is really disappointed in me because i want to study in these fields well i actually believe she has a valid point in this critic as a parent but still these fields are what interest me the most and what i love to do i just finished school last month and she then told me that i am a lazy prick that doesnt go to work because i had some freetime i then found a job applied and got accepted it pays decent and its a cool job because you help people in need and i thnik thats better than workin in mcdonalds feeding into the consumerism of people nowadays well as i got the job she said no you cant have a job you have university starting and i got confused because she told me to get one now i got one and then this and then she tells me paranoid shit like they might sell your organs and kidnap you btw my mother is blatantly stupid im glad im adopted and have not this monkey genes in common with her but she is still my mother then she told me that i have to give her bank account info so the money goes to her when i said no she screamed hit me it didnt hurt but the screaming is hella annoying then wanted to call to my job and say i wnt do it bruh she physically abused me in my childhood where i was a really vulnerable child she doesnt hit me nowadays as much because she realized that i dont give a fuch about her she got weak she is sick and constantly tells me that she is dying and i dont know what to do well she goes to the doctor and does all the stuff yk but it still hurts her telling me that she is going to die she always plays this card when were arguing for example when i want to go out for a little while she tells me that shes sick and is dying she aint even that sick for context she still is able to perform as good in life as before she just gets into these sick phases some times and then i have to do everything she mainly does the cooking and the rest is often up to me like cleaning etc my mother acts as if im her property she wants to decide everything about my life she wanted to marry me to a girl i absolutely hated i refused she screamed the shit out of her soul got nearly a heartattack proceeds to give the faults to me often when i want to go out with the boys she overcomplicates everything and says that i love my friends more than her blah blah blah im not even going out for a party or doing drugs then she wants to call the police because of my behaviour i was fucking years old is this normal dude i cant even get out of the house man she ends up calling her brother for reassure herself and tells him how bad i am etc her brother always tells her to just let me do these tings and that it is normal btw my whole ass family back in my country hates me because of the portrayal my mother gives of me but they dont like her that much either i fully understand them she is the most irresponsible human being i have ever come across she always gaslights me into thinking every wrong doing of her is because of me occasionally when she walks and just nearly slips she screams at me for no reason i believe she is emotionally unstable she hates one of the only person i love right now and wants to ruin our relationship for context im from swtizerland my mother is an immigrant from kosovo we both live in switzerland and she alsways accused me of becoming too much like a swiss peson i always rebuttal i tell her that i just want to be myself and that i dont see myself as albanian nor swiss because i always tell her that i dont give a fuck about nationality my girlfreind years old is such a cool person i love it but she is swiss which is no problem for me but for my mother we often fight over her she tells me i have to marry an albanian girl i hate albanian people i dont know why just had bad experiences with them i dont want to generalize things but i guess im a bit racist then my mother is hyperconservative traditonalisitc hella racist hateful about everything nationalistic dogmatic and really into islam i left islam i kinda hate religion islam in particular the arrogance of it surprises me she always makes me feel guilty about everything that happen to her telling me i cant leave her or else bad things will happen guess what she doenst know how to talk about topics formally and constructive evrything she says is destructive and dogmatic and dude im dead angry about it im always surprised when i see others talking to their mothers like normal people dude hooooow my dad died i believe my mother is overly controlling because of that because she has noone left her husband is dead he suddenly died in an accident which is why my mother doenst let me go out of the house without a big dispute i believe my mother is a really broken person when i told my mother that i have a psychiatrist she got angry at me and told me to not say anything that happens under the house so the main problems in my life i told her that i just wanted to know ways to handle shte stress of schoold better with adhd etc i never had stress in school it was easy and i had never put any effort in it and only skipped classes i mean i still passed everything so all good she didnt belive me and hit me screamed at me and then i cried again my mother is ashamed of me and openly tells everybody about it how ugly i am how dumb i am how i only read books i dont know what her fucking problem is abot reading and i am not even that ugly my girlfriend is a hell of a grilfriend really pretty and she thinks i am pretty too now to the bigger problem i sometimes feel great shame and guilt about the life of my mother and i cant imagine the pain i would feel if i cut her off she would feel lonely sometimes it feels as my responsibility to make sure she might have a good life i told my psychiatrist that i really feel bad for my mother and that i want to help her but its hard and i dont know how my teacher told me i should get out but its hard this is so easy said but its hard its not even a financial thing dude just the emotional thing that destroys me my psychiatrist told me about that i have built a defensive mechanism because of my mother which explains my emotinal numbness sometimes but sometimes i have moments of great psychological pain where i start crying and feel bad about everything that has happened im sure my mother had a really hard life but i dont know what to do i feel so stressed about it and pressured i just cant figure it out everyone tells me to just get away but it feels wrong to leave a broken person behind alone how is she gonna manage how is she going to feel i think its blatanlty egoistic to just leave her behind i mean doesnt she need help too she might be just as broken as i am right now i mean i already feel bad about not spending much time with her i berricade myself in my room so to speak haha anyway my qustion is how would you handle such a situation without moving out i want to have a good relationship with my mother i really do thank you for reading here is some things about me i have also flaws i have adhd which is why i am really disorganized and forgetful i am a very lazy person i am very sarcastic and too open i am very direct which sometimes can hurt people but i dont mean it with bad intent i had a phase where i locked all my emotions up and never told anyone about it now i feel in very good touch with them i am suicidal i am a very indifferent person at times and i rather laugh at my life than take it seriously my best cope my humour can get very mean to peoples feelings i am everything my mother hates and the reason why she feels ashamed she thinks i looks homeless and ugly and she wants to cut my hair off make me bald bro i dont want to be bald i am very insecure about my self my girlfriend helps me with this i love her so much dude i love love its so fascinating how she can see love me so much i miss her rn im seeing her on thursday d i have anxiety issues but im trying to fix them i am overly self critical i have hated myself for a long time and was really afraid of making bounds with other people i can get disrespectful towards authority figures my mood is shifting very often im very cyncial and nihilistic really pssimistic at times so yeah thats about me ive seen most people on here only pointing out flaws about their parents so here also about me so you have a bigger picture of us

i dont really know what to say my parents had a huge argument as they have for a long time now i couldnt handle it anymore and i opened their room door and joined in against him he disrespected my mom my entire family on her side and me he started calling me things and started telling me to come st him if im such a big boy i charged at him didnt really hit him just pushed him down against his bed and my mom tried pulling me off but as soon as he got bsck up i pushed him right back down i hate myself for it although my family fought a lot things were slightly showing signs of improvement but now he threatened to call the police file for a divorce and try to take my sisterhis and my moms forgive me if this has gramatical errors or if its completely incomprehensible my minds all over the place
hi im years old i made this account because i need help on what to do i have tried to reach out before to child protective services and absolutely nothing was done about my situation my mother has always been physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my younger sister who is yes it has affected me but ive learnt to cope with it and im doing okay my sister on the other hand is not okay with it at all my sister is completely dependent and attached to my mother ive seen it before but i only realized the extent of it tonight my sister wasnt being very nice to my mother so she locked her out of her bedroom that is where my sister sleeps every night my sister began crying and banging on her door to let her in and when she did they began screaming at each other both of them calling each other crazy my mother threatened to take her to the hospital to get her mental help she would never do this because shes scared that she will get caught for everything she is doing i was in therapy for a day and i wasnt allowed to go again because of this my mother then began to try and drag my sister out of my room so i interfered and took my sister out i sat with her in the living room for a few minutes and then left to go to my room she then began hysterically crying and couldnt breathe im not sure if it was a panic attack of some sort i kept going back to try and get her to calm down she told me she was scared of my mother later when she calmed down i told her to sleep in her bedroom she said she couldnt i told her that she cant sleep with my mother for the rest of her life and she needs to start now she began crying again saying she couldnt she is too attached to my mother and im scared of what it will lead to this has happened in many other situations before what should i do
my mother prioritizes spending on herself and her boyfriend over my siblings and me last month alone she spent on lingerie while ive only received a pair of jeans in the past year despite the fact that my clothes look really worn out ive stopped complaining because begging her only results in being screamed at and getting called spoiled she basically saves any money that she should spend on her kids so that she can invest it in her own stupid stuff recently i asked her to buy a music event ticket for me as everyone in my class is attending normally i would never spend this much but i have been excited about this since months and was overjoyed when my friends asked me to go with them despite initially agreeing and purchasing them she abruptly changed her mind within like minutes now she insists i give her the money back and has resorted to insulting and calling my friends retards she labeled me an asshole and sternly reminded me that im no longer a child anymore her usual subtle threat of her being able to kick me out furthermore she declared shell never buy anything for me again im hurt and confused i simply wanted to enjoy a common activity with friends yet i ended up being berated and belittled feeling completely pathetic being hurt over something seemingly so unimportant i dont even know what i am supposed to do i dont have any money on my own and i cantt even pay her pack now as she already bought them
social services came round today to discuss housing i tried to tell the social worker that me staying with family isnt an option social worker wasnt very happy about that so i tried to work with the social worker and tried to contact the only person i could think of to stay with my cousin shes always been there for me always been supportive of me pretty sure my mum got to her like she did the rest of my family because she has blocked me i have no family i can go to anymore im and homeless i didnt think my mum would go this far but there ya go i guess i honestly dont know what to do anymore i feel like i have no options i feel like im screwed i knew social services getting involved again was gonna be bad and here we are i just wanna cry
tw rant i have never had the best relationship with my dad growing up he would beat me whenever i stepped out of line for most of my life i would never get even a temporary escape from him as he was unemployed until i turned so every day after school id have to stay with him some days hed say he had meetings or job interviews and then just go cheat on my mom with some random on tinder so as you can see i dont really like him much hes beat me less considering the fact that he had child protective services called on him by an old therapist i used to have for pulling my hair and slapping me around since then he doesnt really hit me as hard as he used to or as frequently growing up hed force me to do fencing a swordsman sport you probably see in the olympics ive never liked it much outside of doing it recreationally at my high school but as of last year hes forced me to take it more seriously and go to national competitions last year i went to an annual competition and did pretty terrible my asthma kicked in and i felt like i was dying as soon as i got out there my dad swore never to invest in me again as the expenses for that tournament were far more than we could afford but here we are again and in three days from now ill be competing in the same tournament in ohio im literally sick to my stomach i begged him not to waste his money on this because i know ill do poorly but he didnt listen he just yelled at me for not being positive but how can you be positive when you lived in such a negative household your whole life im so scared to to be left alone with my dad wednesday through friday competition time normally id text my boyfriend that my dad doesnt know about to cheer me up but i dont really want to tell him about my dad and our problems i have a gpa uw and my dad thinks if i preform well in this colleges will be more eager to accept me but i know myself and i know my my limits and i know i wont do well i know a beating is waiting for me the day i get eliminated from the tournament im so scared
balders gate really highlighted this for me lol i didnt buy it it was gifted does anyone else feel the same way were dealing with near homeless atm and id rather chew my own foot of than to ask for any help i just wish i had a parent that was helpful even just a little bit
i am a girl living in india a place where beating kids is seen as appropriate and discipline i have one of the most emotionally and physically abusive parents who are absolutely great at gaslighting you the thing about these parents are that they show even their basic duties as a gift in fact my dad says that beating me up is his right my parents are these psychopathic people i once told my mom who is extremely judgemental btw tht its ppl s choice to have sex before marriage and its ok whether they want or not she got crazy and tried to touch and rape me to tell me how dangerous it is do uk when she tried to do it the first time when i was she was telling me how guys rape women and to make sure i understood she tried to demonstrate it a mother is supposed to be a place of warmth and happiness but not for everyone in fact for some she causes horrors that leaves a lifetime impact i hate my moms smell looks the way she talks and walks and everything not because she is ugly or unattractive but because i detest the woman she is my dad is no better he screams and yells at me and beats me up with a bat or a broom he doesnt have patience and is a pathetic cheater what icks me off the most about him are not his beatings but his words i cant say those words for they have hurt me so much so damn much i hate how everyone thinks he is this calm and intelligent person when i am the only one who knows what he does and what a cheater he is my mom has a victim complex once there was this tuition teacher when i was years old she used to hit me a lot and always used to degrade mei am not a dumb kid i scored percent in th recently i guess because i already used to get beaten up at home i couldnt take any more of this so i refused to go to that tuition and started crying my mom dragged me out of the home to go to the tuition since i was just a year old kid i started crying so my mom took me back to our house furious at me for crying in public at home she was so angry at me that she started yelling at me and telling me how she wanted me to die all i could do was cry on the floor but then she pounced on me and started pulling my hair so hard that i was sure i would die i tried to push her off me because a grown year old woman was trying to choke me to death i swear that was the first time i saw death my survival skills took over and i pushed her with all the strength a yr old could muster but of course she was too heavy for me so i pulled her hair back and when she loosened her grip a little i escaped her hold then she called all her sistersmy cousins and my tuition teacher to tell them about how i hit her and slapped her at i was labelled as an abuser then her sisters talked to me about how i was an abuser and that i should be handed over to police i couldnt understand what was going on and all i could do was cry suddenly the tuition teacher comes through our door and i am sitting outside on our couch she comes and slaps me hard on my face and i am shocked then she drags me to tuition where she makes me write a poem about how much i love my mother at tuition i was insulted and put forward as an example of what not to be in future then when i came back home my dad said if your parents are trying to kill you its a blessing and then i got beaten up by him so few days earlier my mom was pulling this same thing and then she tore up my diary i had been keeping this diary since i was sexually assaulted another story and tht diary had been my only consolation ever since that day i am on edge and i hate myself

my dad did it in public in front of my friends ffs
children are supposed to be loved ive literally seen a mother threaten to slap her toddler in public by holding her so she couldnt move away and raising her hand as if she was going to hurt while nearly shouting at her just because she was angry and couldnt control it as if they are supposed to be able to control how they act at that age
my parents seem to have a cycle of bullying me and threatening my safety saying they will kick me out onto the street or saying they will take away all access to internet and then trying to fawn over me and obsess over and coddle me my dad will occassionally apologize and say that he overreacted but within a few days they will find something else to shout at me about and say i am lazy and entitled and that they should kick me out because i am taking advantage of them and the cycle repeats but every time within hours of the event they will act as if they never did anything they will see me and smile and be offended if i dont smile back every time i shut down around them my dad says i am going into autistic mode my mom plays the victim if i dont want her to touch me and she says that she just wants connection i tried to come out as queer with a new name to try and start over but my mom gave me the silent treatment for days after and then its like they forgot about that part of me and if i bring it up i am being unfair and threatening their emotional health when i ask why they wont acknowledge my being queer they either say its because their religion says its wrong or mom says that my deadname is the name she gave me when i was born and it is imortant to her i am not allowed to change my middle name either they say that both of them cant think about me in any other way if i talk about my mental health struggles at all they say i obsess too much and i should just get a job and that i dont work hard enough and have not suffered enough i acknowledge everything would be better if i get a job even though as much as i try i dont even make interviews my dad says that if i wanted a job i would have one by now i know they gaslight me i know they are emotionally immature i just dont know how deep it goes in their perspective and i dont know if they are consciously aware of the pain they cause that when i try to say i am suicidal my mom gets triggered and she shouts at me once said that my being suicidal makes her suicidal shes grabbed me and not let me get away and she always seems to act before thinking like if shes emotional hurt she will remove all my access to family account connections like amazon so i cant use amazon prime shipping when needed i feel like i am insane because these parents give me toptier ipads for christmas and really expensive tech but then they turn around and say they can take it away i feel guilty for even thinking of how they treat me as abuse my dad says my mom loves me so much and would do anything to protect me and feels so much pain for me my dad has also said that if it was an ultimatum between me and my mom he would always choose my mom and then blames me if mom leaves late at night after an argument and says were getting a divorce this is what you wanted are you happy to be clear i dont want them to divorce i dont want to hurt them even by estranging myself from them i dont know how to reconcile any of this the side of them that coddles me with the side that makes me afraid i will be homeless and without medication management support that makes me feel so unsafe and struggling emotionally i am for reference graduated from college as of december after almost seven years but have a few disabilities that make it hard to even find work i am using vocational rehab so i am currently dependant on my parents and suicidal depression makes it hard to even focus on getting a job when i am just trying to make sure i stay alive
i thought my parents would change when i came out as transgender female at first they accepted but as ive been living here last few months particularly my dads behavior is getting worse hes been being extremely political lately which is part of the problem is he watches stuff on youtube i dont agree with it apparently he sees me and my mom as slaves now were supposed to clean the house and do everything he doesnt want to do he has kicked me out before for refusing to clean i told my mom that if he did that i wouldnt speak to ether of them again i would leave he also said after i had decided to clean that he was going to raise my rent not to mention i currently feel fatigued and ill because im sort of sick im at my literal breaking point rn
for context hes been abusive my entire life both physically and emotionally on top of a lot of other sht in my current years hes been also controlling my mom financially apparently and was really emotionally unstable and now hes coming back soon after a couple of days im not sure how to feel but my siblings seem excited to have him back soon they dont know that hes abusive and think hes absolutely darling i dont want to tell my mom about this because shes stressed enough a literal scar has been left from him leaving he hurt her and im not sure i like the idea of him coming back nor do i feel bad for him but i dont think i can change it
so ive been coughing up white mucus and have been having shortness of breath and chest pain for the past two months and today it got really bad i couldnt breathe properly i started feeling dizzy and faint it took a lot of effort to keep myself straight and i felt weak i started crying because i thought i was dying that this was my end i seriously consitered jumping off my balcony so i wouldnt die of suffocation that i could at least have a quick death my mom ignored me the whole time she just kept taking her bath she told me to go to bed but i was afraid to go to sleep i was very sure i wasnt going to wake up if i did eventually i started mumbling about how i was going to die and i begged her to take me to the emergency room i begge because i felt like i was going to fucking collapse she started screaming at me calling me a drama queen saying im faking it and that i just want attenchion that i was an attenchionseeker she grabbed me shook me and eventually started hitting me all while i contunied to beg to go to the damn doctor she told me she hopes i die that im such an attenchionseeker and she was tired of me she kept hitting me everytime i coughed but eventually she took me she screamed the whole way about how she was a prisoner and that she cant have a life because of me im this is the only time shes taken me to one ive had other issues but she just yelled at me to shut up and hit me untill i was to afraid to ask thats why i never ask anymore but i really couldnt breathe it was either get hit and go or stay here and possible die the entire appointment took minuites she couldnt even take less then an hour and a half to take me to the doctor the emenergy room wasent sure what was wrong with me my blood pressure was a little higher then it was supposed to be and they kept suggesting asthma they eventually just told me to go get an xray since they thought there might be something wrong with my lungs they also have me some antibiotics and an inhaler well they told my mom to go get them and hasnt yet i hope she does i dont want to die next time i cant breathe i have adhd so by law im required medicaid she didnt have to pay for the appointment it wasnt a money thing she just didnt want to waste her time i dont know im tired of this all i think shes always been like his i kept getting ear infection as a younger child and it always took her months to take me as i screamed in pain she never took me to the dentist until i was and finally called social services on her and they made her take me i think i might have some kind of ptsd or something since im constantly paranoid about my health since i know theres nothing i can do worst comes to worse i hope she gets my medication i dont want to die
please excuse any spelling errors im dyslexic i ftm believe my father m is watching me now i came here because im not sure if this can be considered abuse and im not sure if im being dramatic ever sense i was about and it was known that i had started my period ive noticed that my father has perched himself outside of my door whenever hes suspicious if he comes into my room and notices that im laying in my bed doing absolutely anything at all after he leaves i can clearly hear him outside my door standing there listening if i turn on music on or move around he bursts in pretending to have forgotten something i caught him multiple times when i snuck over to my door and opened it as he was standing there listening he would pretend that nothing was happening this has happened periodically sense i was young once when i was the same thing had happened but this time he made me keep my door open the rest of the day whenever i asked why nether him or my mother could make up any excuse and just said because my family is vary religious and that probably has something to do with his behavior but is it not weird that my father only my father not not mother would burst in at any chance at seeing something he never has seen me doing absolutely anything and theres no knock or warning am i being dramatic or is this weird other odd things hes done that seem unrelated are that when i was young yo he would slap my butt in a teasing way but especially when i bent over i always told him i didnt like it but he continued until i was about and stood my ground telling him to not do it anymore he told me i was being dramatic but stoped plus some other odd things again i dont know if these are related or at all any concern i get told by any family i tell that im being dramatic so maybe i am what do you think
i dont think my parents were outright abusive but i dont know where else to post this maybe they were neglectful in some aspects i apologize in advance that is a very long post im ftm by the way my dad used to be an alcoholic and would allow my siblings and i to watch really raunchy movies and the show bojack horseman when we were younger i watched the th and th seasons of bojack with my dad when they came out i was i also saw a lot of south park when i was younger one time my dad picked me up from a volleyball game told me he was fucking hammered my dad has made a lot of inappropriate sex jokes about my siblings and i one time he joked about my sister being a lesbian and having a large tongue my dad asked me if i knew what masturbation was when i was in th grade and he tells my family that its funnier to add the words in bed to the end of fortune cookies and i got a fortune cookie that said something like it takes a long time to figure out what works and my dad said that was true my brother told me that olive oil was used as lube because thats a mildly interesting history fact and my dad overheard and said he tried it and it didnt work very well my parents have had sex in the same room as my siblings and i it would happen in hotel rooms and the camper when we were camping and my parents always thought we were all asleep and i dont think my sisters have ever heard anything but my brother and i have also my parents bedroom is right above mine i dont want to be hearing them have sex my dad has gotten extremely drunk and had some kind of breakdown im not sure what to call it but he yells at people this has happened three times the first time this happened was about years ago my family and i had just come from a basketball game and we were trying to walk back to our car but my dad kept walking off and talking about how he wanted to die i cried and my mom got mad at me for crying when we got back to our car my dad left again my siblings and i went after him we told him not kill himself and a stranger told him that it gets better my dad said thanks and eventually we got back to the car and went home the second time this happened was almost years ago on my sisters birthday this is the only time this happened and my family was at home my dad got drunk and he started screaming at my mom about how he needed to find his phone and how my mom needed to help him find it she said no and my dad took the van and drove off i dont remember if this was before or after he left but my dad told me to not cry and that it wasnt my problem my dad crashed the side of the van into a tree and now you cant open the right door of our van because it has a really hard time closing the third time this happened was about a year ago and it was the most stressful my family and i were going on a trip we had to do a layover in florida and were going to spend the night there my dad got drunk in the airport and he called the hotel and kept asking for a shuttle there was never a shuttle my dad kept insisting there was a shuttle the hotel was asking about the reservation and asked for the code that was emailed to my dad my dad started saying there wasnt a code and i offered to take the phone and finish the call myself but my dad said that would just make him angry i started crying in the airport because he was being drunk and angry and im sensitive like that my brothers girlfriend who was with us called over a taxi because she was fed up with my dad and we needed to get to the hotel when we got to the hotel it was a whole other situation apparently we didnt have the money to pay for the hotel night im fairly certain we did and my dad just wasnt figuring it because he was extremely drunk my dad started crying about going to jail because my dad was taking care of his dad and adult protective services were charging him because he wasnt taking care of my grandpa well my dad was yelling about how he was going back to america and my sister told him that he was still in america and my dad started yelling about something else then my dad tried paying for our hotel rooms again and started talking to the receptionist about how there wasnt a shuttle i told my dad that it didnt matter at this point if there was a shuttle or not because we are at at the hotel now my dad told me to not fucking talk to him like that i started crying harder and my mom was so fed up with it she paid for our hotel rooms herself even though it was supposed to be a vacation paid by my dad we had rooms one for me my brother and his then girlfriend one for my sisters and one for my parents anyway we got the keys to our rooms the receptionist was a very nice person who didnt speak a lot of english and my brother and i apologized to him profusely the receptionist gave my brother and i free bottled waters and told us to have a good night i was still crying and i told him to have a good night too i actually think about him sometimes because he was so patient with my dad even though my dad was being horrible in the hotel room my brother his then girlfriend and i were just trying to distract ourselves with the internet no one could fall asleep eventually my mom came into the hotel room and thanked me for telling my dad he was being shitty she told me she couldnt do it anymore and that she had to go tell him that she loved him and that hes not a bad person i feel so bad for my mom because i know this has happened to her a lot more than its happened to the rest of my family in the morning my dad said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart and one of my sisters said she forgave him i didnt thats not okay also my dad got drunk in a hotel a few years ago and threw his phone on the floor so hard it broke because he got mad about door dash not working my siblings and i still joke about that one because that was really stupid any time my dad drinks now he gets physically sick so he cant drink anymore my parents starting dating when my mom was and my dad was my dad was my moms debate coach and my mom became a high school dropout when she was to go live with him and they got married when my mom was i didnt know how my parents met until i was about and i only learned because my brother told me i did think my parents age gap was weird though i once made a joke about underage drinking in front of my mom and she said she only underage drank when my dad gave her alcohol i overheard my parents talking a few weeks ago and it was interesting my mom has been thinking about getting a divorce or going to marriage counseling for the last months my dad doesnt want to do either my mom said she was in an inappropriate relationship with him when she was a child i didnt hear what my dad said but soon after he said he doesnt like the way my mom treats him i was in the car with my dad a few weeks ago and my dad told me how my mom has been talking to him more and more about their relationship and my mom told my dad that she didnt think my dad is catholic no one in my family except my mom is religious my dad has been lying to my mom their entire relationship about how he is catholic my dad actually got baptized as an adult and told me about how fucking wasted he would get before those meetings my dad told me that my mom wishes she had a good catholic family and how he never wanted anyone to go to church in the first place i honestly wish my parents never started dating because i believe they would both be happier if they never did my mom doesnt listen to anything anyone says its extremely infuriating recently i had a big argument with her because our dryer was broken and i asked her if she could call someone to get it fixed she said no and i asked why but she just kept saying she wouldnt do it i cried a lot about this because this was a problem that affected our entire family and she wasnt doing anything about it my brother fixed it hes good with machines a few years ago i got into a really big argument with my mom because she kept putting bread in the freezer i live in a family of putting bread in the freezer is doing nothing and was only taking up freezer space apparently i asked in a mean way or whatever because my mom said i dont want to help you if youre freaking out i gave up trying to win that argument i got into a lot of arguments with my mom when i was about but i stopped trying to win them i have learned that nothing i say to her will matter i still have a poor relationship with my mom but i dont care about fixing it the rest of my family has similar issues with her my dads main issue with my mom is that they cant communicate and my mom not listening is part of that my mom used to sign my siblings and i up for alter serving and mass readings without asking and this would always bother us so much about a year ago my mom signed my sister for a mass reading and my sister was infuriated and called my mom a bitch my sister ended up doing the reading but my mom was really mad at my sister any time i get into an argument with my mom one of my first thoughts is i hate that goddamn woman this has happened multiple times but i do not know if it is true i can get along with my mom but i would rather not talk to her everything she does bothers me in some way which i think is unfair to her and she is the only person in my life who i seriously dislike i started self harming at the first time i ever cut myself it was a few cuts and i went into my living room to show my parents these weird cuts they didnt say anything or seem to care at all i mainly self harmed on my legs for a few years my brother got a girlfriend who self harmed my brother was and so was his girlfriend when i was my family was at my brothers girlfriends house because our families were actually really close because our parents got along and all the kids were similar ages well my brothers girlfriend cut her arm while we at their house when we driving home my mom told my siblings and i that if we ever wanted to hurt ourselves we can always talk to her i remember thinking no ive been doing this for years no when i was my mom saw self harm cuts on my hands she asked me if i ever did it anywhere else and i lied and told her no she told me that some people are into weird shit and i just laughed awkwardly i told her i wouldnt do it again a few weeks later one of my friends reported me to my school counselor for self harm my counselor asked me if i wanted to tell my parents about my self harm and i knew that it was required for them to tell my parents im still mad at her for giving me an illusion of a choice even though i knew there was never one so my parents told me they loved me and told me to not hurt myself again i lied and said okay my mom wanted me to go to therapy so i went to a single online therapy session i really really did not want to go to therapy i told my parents i didnt want to go to therapy again and my dad defended me because he didnt want me to be put in a box my dad also has some weird beliefs about being medicated my mom said that i didnt have to go to that therapist but maybe i could try again in a few months so a few months later about the same time i was i was supposed to go to another online therapy session my parents saw more self harm cuts on my hands my parents told me that when im hurting myself im hurting them too thats not helpful assholes dont make it about yourself i said i was sorry but i refused the other therapy session my dad kept defending me and i didnt have to go also my mom told our extended family about my self harm and never told me i only know this because my grandma gave me a photo of jesus holding someone like me and she told me it would help with my anxiety i hate that my mom told anything i didnt even want her knowing this was nearly years ago i accept now that i need therapy but i will not be asking for therapy while i am still living with my parents i do not feel comfortable asking for it i do not feel comfortable asking them for almost anything im trans and my parents dont do a great job of supporting me i am fully socially transitioned and have been out for over a year all of my friends and people that i know except extended family use my correct name and pronouns my dad uses my name in front of me and im fairly certain he doesnt when talking to other people my mom doesnt even try she only thinks of me as her daughter and nothing i do will ever change her mind i came out to my parents twice and both times it was over text the first time it was really basic and i told them my name and pronouns and i told them i loved them the second time was a few weeks later and i told them that i wanted them to start using my name and pronouns because i was hurt that they werent trying my dad said that he was using theythem for me and my mom said we never got to talk about how im trans i use hehim pronouns and what is there to talk about im trans im your son the end i have a really hard time correcting people about anything so i dont even try to correct my parents it seriously hurts my feelings but im not doing anything about it i have always had a really difficult time understanding math even though i do fairly well in other subjects one time in rd or th grade my mom was helping me with math homework but all she did was call me stupid until i cried my dad actually watched this happen and didnt say anything when i was younger around kindergarten age my mom slapped me twice at different times my dad asked me if my mom had ever hit me and i told him no because i didnt want my parents to argue anytime the topic of child abuse is brought up my mom asks my siblings and i if we are traumatized my siblings and i never answer but almost every time my parents are out of the house my siblings and i talk about the annoying things our parents do my dad has told me that his parents beat him and i know he didnt have the greatest childhood i know my mom had helicopter parents and grandma is still weird to be around my grandma always thinks people are talking poorly about her and thinks everyone around her is ungrateful she makes a lot of people in my family just straight up uncomfortable especially my aunt also my mom usually makes dinner and always puts the food away after maybe minutes this has caused everyone in my family to eat really quickly and any time i eat with other people i am always the first person to finish eating and it makes me so self conscious my mom rushes everything if something is brought to her attention it needs to be taken care of immediately if we need to go somewhere she rushes everyone to the car as fast as possible and gets really passive aggressive really quickly this is sometimes helpful but most of the time its just stressful my parents do not listen to me when i talk about my interests this hurts my feelings a lot because i really appreciate being listened to i have very strong interests in certain topics and i used to tell my parents about them all the time i realized they do not listen to me when i was about and this hurt my feelings very badly it still does when i was younger my parents had this rule that my siblings and i had to go to school unless we threw up like it didnt matter if we were sick unless we threw up i believe they started this to deter my siblings and i from faking illness but we werent the kind of kids to do this in the first place one time in th grade i really was sick i dont remember all of my symptoms but i had really bad headaches and was extremely exhausted for a week but i never bothered telling my parents because i never threw up and i knew they would make me go to school anyway in th grade i got sick i really really wanted to stay home so i tried to force myself to throw up in order to stay home i didnt have the puking kind of illness but i was sick my mom caught me trying to vomit and got mad at me but she let me stay home i dont think she believed i was sick but didnt care enough to force me to go to school my parents thankfully havent enforced this rule in over years and if im really adamant about not going to school they dont make me i dont overuse this i skip about days a school year my parents argue a lot by the way it used to be a lot worse but its still not pleasant but they havent argued really badly in a few years because my dad seemingly gave up anyway i prefer being around my dad than my mom by a lot i do wish my parents were better i wish i could tell them about my interests and they would listen i wish i could my parents that i had a hard day i want them to be better but i dont think i am ever getting that when i was years old and my brother was he sexually abused me i still feel really weird saying that because i dont think it was actually that bad but i do not know what else to call it im not going into detail of what my brother did for this post but rather what my parents did because the answer is nothing my brother and i slept in the same basement in the same bed for years i have no idea how our parents didnt think anything could be wrong one time when i was my brother took pictures of me shirtless well my mom found them and confronted me about it i clearly did not take the pictures and she was mad at me she told me about how someone could use the photos for child porn and she deleted the pictures but i seriously have no idea how she didnt think about how i did not take them myself during the last year of this my brother and i slept in the attic together again i have no idea how my parents never thought anything was wrong but mostly im mad at my mom for not thinking anything was wrong when she found the pictures of me shirtless thank you very much for reading i really do appreciate it i just want to know if my parents could have been better i dont think they ever wanted to be bad parents but maybe they could have been there more for my siblings and i
please help me is she abusive anyone have an idea of what is wrong with my mum im aware smth is wrong with me but shes a problem shes always been bad but got worse after her dad died two and a half years ago and im not nice either but we gloss over that for now cause i am working on it for starters she cant ever admit shes wrong i think in years ive heard her apologise to me once after slapping me on the face and scratching it which she still tried to say she only meant to slap me not scratch me she then asked me to lie to people about what happened she has called me all sorts and cant ever say sorry today i said pretty awful things in an argument she started which she denies and she said pretty awful things like calling me a pig but doesnt see she was in the wrong she lies all the time and twists my words against me i said i wanted a mother who cared about me because i dont feel she does when she treats me like this she said that i had said she should have never adopted me she often tries to gaslight me into thinking she didnt say things to the point where i wonder if im imaging things but i dont have this problem at school so i dont think so i have a lot of friends she refuses to get a thearipst ive literally begged her so she can learn to be nice she barely has any friends she blows up over small things and then blames me she has hit me many a time and i have to her my dad hits me too and vise versa

i f live with my family i grew up with an emotionally abusiveneglective mom and a physically abusive little sister sometimes my mom would join in on the physical abuse but it was never anything serious until a year ago i have past trauma of being sexually assaulted by my ex step dad years ago and my mom keeps putting off therapy about a year ago my mom started spanking me out of the blue it wasnt as punishment or anything she just did it i would be minding my own business and she would come up behind me and smack my butt ive expressed how much this made me uncomfortable multiple times but she would pull the victim card and accuse me of calling her a pervert and how i hurt her feelings she kept doing it and i had to bare with it i was ok with dealing with it in silence until recently about a week ago my mom smacked my butt again but this time i told her straight up that it makes me uncomfortable and i dont appreciate her touching me like that she just ignored me and complained about me to my now step dad i thought she would stop after that but the very next day she did it again she never stops no matter how many times ive asked her to stop she knows about how ive been sexually assaulted multiple times starting back when i was but she wont stop i dont have the money to move out and i have no friendsfamily to stay with what should i do any advice
i have no control over it my mom wants to give him away because she isnt patient enough for him to grow up a little and learn to behave better with the help of a behaviorist now someone else will love my sweet sweet pup the way that i did i can never get him back theyll play all his favourite games with him theyll get to pet him they will take him on walks and take him around he will get all the love he deserves but i wont be the one doing it i might see him in another house in someone elses lap getting all their love and i will never get to do it again he will have a new name new house new favorite humans and he will forget about me people who dont know the truth will judge me and hold me equally responsible for giving him away theyll shun me while i sit by myself helpless missing such a big part of my life that i can never have back
hi im a teenage girl and i have two older brothers and a single mom ever since i was little guys have come in and out of the house usually they are weird or sketchy as in the do drugs alcohol criminal past etc this is due to my moms rough childhood past and her broken boy slection she also has a rathelarge savior complex she is also a crazy minopulator so when the guys realize it they tend to get the hell out i dont blame them so basically my moms new bf moved in with his little year old the year old does have some behavior issues exlies repeatedly asks for things spoiled annoying screams a lot but personally i dont consider them to be that bad she has gone through her own personall trauma however my mom since she is licensed to work with kids thinks she can fix her she has been doing all sorts of disciplines which i believe have now gone too far ex feeding her spicy strachan when she misbehaves making her repeat tomes that shes not in control spanking her multiple times rather hard making her weardiapers because she peed in the bed making her cut apart her own stuffed animals making her do lots of exercises upstairs naked screaming and yelling at her would you consider this abuse i personally am starting to and i havenever seen my mom like this i think she is taking her frustrations out on the girl what should i do my mom is a manipulator and at this point the bf is thinking of moving out
im not gonna throw my whole story about my mom but to sum it up was going through the worst time of my life i was and became super depressed ended up almost dying intentionally and she told me i was being dramatic when i revealed i tried then babies my brothers acts sexist racist homophobic and always belittles and berates me constantly says things and lies and manipulates my worst example yet was i asked if my brother was okay when he was being taken to the hospital and they said yes so i didnt worry and continued on with the week only today to hear my mom telling everybody he almost died later which freaked me out i went to bed that night crying on the spot in the couch he was laying in alone since i was alone those entire days so little rant here my mom can be nice and gives great advice but she also can be terrible like when i was and she told me that everything happening to me was my fault and im too blame to her getting mad at me for standing up for myself and more recently her looking at me and telling me looks like you need to get your but on the peloton shes made me hate myself countless times and is the main reason i can barely eat dairy gluten and sugar anymore because she ignored me when i would cry in pain and tell her everyday i was hurting until the point i almost had a stomach ulcer it took me whole years to convince my mom i wasnt faking being in pain and now im finally better however my stomach got heavily damaged and now i cant eat any of that really another great example was i was laying on the couch in pain and she came back home from going shopping and started yelling at me causing me of just wanting to hang out in my ipad while i was laying there crying in pain i didnt know why until she said oh its cause you ate yogurt and i was confused then she said oh yeah youre lactose intolerant i think youre supposed to tell your kids what the allergy and intolherence testing says also she was the one who made it for me knowing full well it would make me be in pain i have a great example here i get hot flashes often since im going through puberty and my mom got mad at me for wanting to wear loose shorts in celsius keep in mind im born and raised in canada she told me to go put leggings on and i calmly explained that they were too hot and told her i checked the weather and everything i also had a sweater because my legs were just really hot in both ways jk she then started screaming at me and told me if i wore shorts in this weather i would look like a freak and an attention whore funniest part is my dad was right beside me wearing a tshirt and shorts i was more dressed than him and my brother was wearing shorts too shorter than mine she also constantly tells me i need to start working out more and will squeeze my legs or my but as she says that great im going into highschool i dont need to be more self conscious and i am not overweight by any means but then again i also dont know my weight since im not allowed to know thats just what doctors have said in medical examinations another thing thats pissing me off is my brother recently went to the hospital which of course i feel terrible because he couldve literally died luckily its just a condition not serious or anything no organ or brain damage so hes okay hell be back to normal in a couple of days but because of this huge development my parents cancelled my entire birthday which is weeks away which this is the one year i actually got one see every year for my birthday my mom would ask people to bring cans of food and then shed donate it all which is awesome i love that but as a year old who really wanted a scooter it sucked and i wasnt allowed to have friend birthdays either just family im not mad about gifts or anything i actually specifically told my entire family to not get me anything for my birthday because i dont like getting gifts my birthday day was going to be my family actually spending the day with me thats all i wanted she also acts like im lesser in many ways ill voice a concern such as me almost passing out and throwing up after using a tampon and shell tell me im being over dramatic but the second she sees my brother even slightly sad she legitimately went hes depressed i was laying in bed staring at the wall with tear running down my face for weeks on end and you did nothing nothing dont fucking tell me i dont know what suicidal depression is not to mention her obviously being sexist and being okay with my great uncle gropping my butt he is mentally challenged i understand that but she still makes me hug him whenever i see him which is alright i guess just uncomfortable because hes very touchy she also gives me these rules work out times a week do all the laundrey do all the dishes i mean for everyone for both those things hang out with friends once a week get as in everything hours of homework every night no wearing pajamas outside of your room not allowed to mix two baggy clothes together at least the pants or the shirt has to be tight no spending any of your money all of it goes into savings and also maximum amount of gluten a day slices of bread maximum amount of dairy fudgecicle maximum amount of sugar popsicle rarely a couple chips also no soda at all since it causes cancer and not much meat since it also causes cancer and also nothing not natural because it all causes cancer she also yells at me a lot like she once yelled at me because i couldnt find her shoes and stayed screaming at me in anger and i will ask her something like hey can you help me with a projec no im already stressed enough ughhhh its so annoying sometimes she rarely lets me finish sentences and tells me dont be negative when i tell her about this girl i dont like at school ill also tell her hey dont tell anyone this like some really private stuff were talking like stuff about my body too and shell go and tell everyone and then say i didnt know im sorry ahhhhhh sometimes i dont know what to think she critiques me in every way possibly i bring home a report card of all as and she says good job and thats it she hasnt even let me seen my own report card she gets mad at me for not working out for days straight and for eating junk food a popsicle and tbh i would go outside but i dont have anyone to go with i dont like the kids in my class ive made that very clear yet my mom continues to get mad at me for not being more social i linked up today how to get outside more because i am trying to cut down my screen time and all i saw was family activities i didnt realize spending a whole day with your family in summer was normal like just waking up and going to the beach or something or grabbing ice cream and talking i didnt know that was normal and now im starting to question everything
long story short i need help my mother has been emotionally and vocally abusive for a large portion of my life i think i was barely a preteen when it started but my memories of the early incidents are hazy and i dont remember exactly when she began targeting me i know i grew up with her berating and belittling dad whenever he misunderstood something or got something wrong or sometimes for no reason at all shed scream at him and cuss despite her children being right there she still does that the only difference is she takes her frustrations out on me too she especially loves targeting my insecurities and my health conditions both physical and mental she accuses me of faking my tics for attention she calls me lazy and ungrateful because my depression and arrhythmia make moving around the house a chore shes mocked my sensory issues on facebook in front of everyone and called me a crybaby because i hated the texture of some clothes she bought me more than once she has compared my issues to her own rpe trauma saying i should be grateful i dont have it as bad gaslighting traumadumping you name it now shes even tried to throw me out of the house because i refuse to get a job even though my unmedicated depression anxiety and arrhythmia make that nearly impossible with the arrhythmia alone i often have to sit down to bathe myself in the shower or wash the dishes because my heartbeat skyrockets and i might pass out otherwise im now and i cant call child protective services or anyone to help me escape however ive called both the aps and the police with little result my panic attacks have gotten so much more frequent and im constantly on edge just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for her to blow up on me again i can barely even eat anymore because shes always around ive had maybe two whole bananas split across three unfinished ones in over a week now my heart is really starting to fight back my boyfriend has recently started a fundraiser to help me out of my situation if anyone is willing to spend any money or just share the news i can pm the link
f i was in the heat of a panic attack and i was asking my mom for reassurance that im okay and she starts screaming at me and almost hit me like times and i asked her to stop yelling she said how else am i supposed to make you listen this is how you make kids listen back in my day when i was crying and shaking and she knows i dont go good with people yelling around me because of my dad and she said how do you think i feel having to put up with your shit like this all the time i cant call anyone like police wise since if she goes to jail ill be stuck with dad and hes not safe to be around due to addiction and if he gets arrested ill be basically homeless idk what to do this isnt the first time something like this has happened this happens on an almost daily basis but i need others opinion on what this seems like because no one is listening to me irl
for context im my little sister is i havent been in contact with my dadstepmom for a little over years my sister texted me asking for help with computer questions and what started all of whats below this is me not replying to the questions they were making my sister ask me my abusivemanipulative stepmom made a new phone number to text me again after a whole years of not being in contact with them because of everything theyve done to me between abusing me pointing knives at my neck gaslighting me manipulating me etc they will not leave me alone and now i apparently cant talk to my own little sister when she asks me for help they have done everything under the sun to try and manipulate me or get my money which is not obviously not working theyve essentially conditioned my poor little sister into not even being able to function and i mean to the point where shes scared of using a microwave to heat up food i wish i was joking they invited jerk into their house who was a previous abuser of mine and they treated jerk like a good family friend despite knowing what hes done to me beating me abusing me mentallyphysically implying several different ways to my mom that she should take her life abusing my mom not letting us go to the doctor when needed etc the people im referring to in the sms screenshots abusive stepmom jerk abusive ex stepdad screenshot screenshot i called my mom immediately after because these horrible people my dad stepmom and abusive ex stepdad stress me out to the point where i pace back and forth and dont even realize it i love my little sister but taking my ability to talk to her away is horrible im stressed out and very anxious on top of that im going through a major depression episode currently and i dont know what to do or how to prevent them from not letting me talk to my sister im worried theyre going to make her block me and delete my number im not in the same state as my sister either im sorry that this is all over the place i just cant really focus right now
im just recently at coming to terms with the fact that my mom was abusive she hasnt really done most of it since a few years ago now for some reason idk why she still love bombs and makes me feel really guilty for not wanting to be around her she has always love bombed but was also abusive and filled with hate maybe im just not remembering but as the middle kid i dont think she was like that with either of my brothers im still the one most messed up in the head but i dont know if she abused me because of that or if im like this because of the abuse was anyone else here the only one of your siblings that you remember or are being abused if so do you have any thoughts on it or anything thanks
at least five different people have seen her and concluded the mother has extreme envy but when questioned she even becomes violent and contemptuous towards the child mocking it showing malicious envy when the child has something she wants she tries to get it for herself first and when the child does better than her she tries to destroy her to a level where she doesnt look as bad she involves herself gratuitously with the child who she has betrayed in an issue with the father who therefore wants to cut off contact with her but always to try to slander mock and try to cut the child down and determine what she can and cant do she refuses to see the child as an adult and when asked to either support her child or eff off she says she never wanted to be a mother she then tries to misgender her child or say horrific things about her passing opinions she has no right to pass anymore given she economically abused the child out of the claim she didnt ever want to be a mother just sheer hate oozing off of her essentially she is raiding the daughters life for parts as her mother while trying to claim she never wanted to be a mother extreme malicious envy to the point of violence apparent what would you do ive never seen someone this bad its really hard to be the child of someone like this who people actively can see is in malicious envy then denies it then denies ever wanting to be a mother while passing opinions when she shouldnt be involved but then claiming the mother card when she gets caught in involvement
im a junior in college and havent been financially dependent on my step mom and dad for years and currently working hours away in the middle of nowhere with barley no service which they know and two week prior was yelled at cause by my stepmom who said me and my girlfriend who have been traveling for hours btw said we had bed bugs which we didnt my girlfriends dad is a pest technician she was yelling at me and called me almost every name in the book and me and my girlfriend left my stepmom and dads place immediately and havent been there for the past two weeks and not once have they reached out to apologize or anything but bills i have to pay for stuff college and yesterday i was blow away by these texts she sent calling me butt hurt and that i need to get over myself im just exhausted of them and really dont know what to say or what to do anymore this has been going on my whole life but now that im an adult i want to decide what relationship i want to have with my family
im now still living with my mom this is hard for me to write as i always suppress everything my mom has done to me and move it to the back of my head to the point i forget it but today marks the final straw and i want to share my story my mom has been mean to me for awhile now she always yells at me for forgetting things when i have adhd and i have a memory problem she tells me i have to have a gf that she accepts and the girl im with right now she doesnt like just because she has tattoos and piercings but i love her to death she acts faced with people says thank you honey to her friends but when shes alone with me shes sometimes nice but she gets so mad easily she blames me for her working so much and she also has my bank account information and she sees my finances and also takes money out i ask her why did you take money out she says i needed it for bills dont be penny nickel and dime with me im your mother she also tells me i have no controll in this house and no rights she also tells me i am so close of getting kicked out none of my family takes my side when i tell what she does because i thought it was a normal things mothers did but shes gotten worse im and i now have a cerfew she hates that she now wants my location she takes shit about me behind my back to her fucking co workers she blamed me for going to another state for extra money and just todsy she got mad over me sleeping in i dont know still is this normal
my partner broke up with me a month ago in a severe mental health crisis hes currently hot and cold and caught between wanting me back and feeling scared of how he treated me during the breakup he was verbally and emotionally abusive thats not typical i kind of knew throughout our relationship but have been really putting the pieces together that a lot of our issues have come down to his family accepting him back not just for me but for the mental state hes been in his family is generationally poor but ran into extreme wealth right before he was born his entire life was planned for him before he was born but he turned out to be disabled and gay he had a super tumultuous upbringing was kicked out and spent his teen years homeless in active addiction with his family turning a blind eye i have some family with money and their dynamic reminds me a lot of mine its a very well give you reward money if youre doing well but if you dont meet expectations were not gonna help you you have to help yourself type of system a year ago my boyfriend was given a check from his grandparents for the first time since he was shortly after he found out he has an inheritance i started to notice a shift after this he started denying his parents abuse and being selfcritical in really intense ways that reflected his upbringing this was obviously concerning me but i have been down that road before with my family being nicer to me and i know its just so hard when you just want family i was really expecting this shift to kind of run its course when hed go home without me almost every time hed call me having a panic attack unsure of why im honestly questioning now why i didnt try to find a kind way of saying it i was worried hed get upset or start to break down he wasnt in therapy until very recently was trying to get him in for months before he made that step i just know how jarring and unnerving it is to remember how bad things were and i didnt want to push that work or let him go through it unsupported outside of the person telling him hed come back from these visits totally shaken up but denying it but something i didnt quite realize the full extent to until recently is how much the ways he treated me were influenced by his family dynamics he started to be ableist toward me were both disabled obsessive around money im pretty sure he was playing a money game with me that i wasnt aware of in that i think he was expecting me to hold up ends on certain things without telling me because i make less than him his behavior and treatment of me started to feel really off like i was missing something around the start of this year and honestly the only time ive seen something like this was from people with money having expectations they dont tell you about and this is super opposite to who he is hes an anarchist hes struggled more with physical disability than i have being bedbound for long stretches of time and having to use mobility aids at certain points at the start of our relationship he lent me some money he told me he was more than comfortable giving me because i was struggling to pay rent he actually insisted he has continually upheld that hes more than happy to through this break up hes told me if im ever struggling financially to let him know but sometimes when hes mad he says things that are just a little bit off feel like a little resentment and ive kept my concerns about family and the impact on him mostly to myself if he ever outright denies his past i say hold on xyz happened and he kind of shrugs it off he started calling his mom a lot before he broke up with me and both times he broke up with me most of what he talked about was his career and financial success i asked him one time to question if a specific thing his mom said aligned with what he wanted and he screamed dont talk about my mom like that its just so tough im the only person whos seen this development and its getting to a really concerning point his familys inclusion of him again is supporting all of his biggest fears around financial insecurity tied to his homelessness trauma but its all conditional love i think he feels afraid that he wont be successful enough to be good in the eyes of his family the shitty thing is my dad went down this road to an extreme and i know that even when you do everything you can youre just never enough hes pushing himself way past the point of burnout in terms of work and career success and he cut me off instead of the work after telling me he was planning the opposite but then he called his mom again im really scared for the day he realizes that he chose conditional love tied up in money by people who abused him over unconditional support and love from someone who holds him while he screams and cries who encourages him to tell himself that hes enough and to do selfwork for himself and him alone until he believes it he always tells me i give the best advice that im the kindest and most patient person to him he has other wonderful supports in his life that he doesnt use his mom gives advice thats super questionable sometimes all about success and sometimes she just says the meanest offhanded remarks when hes trying so hard but even though i tried to stay out of the game and let it play itself out it became me vs them and im worried this isnt about our relationship anymore its about the slippery slope for him and the way hes been treating himself i wrote some pages about my dads experience of embracing abusive family with money that honestly has so many parallels to him just went way too far unnoticed for way too long i cant think of another way to express concern i worry about talking to him directly with how its gone in small moments before but i also question if i should express concern at all i dont want the whiplash of not trusting anyone not right now but his family are not good for him in this way you can keep family but you have to keep them at a distance when theyve hurt you like this you have to question their advice i had to he does still trust me but theres some broken trust its hard to tell where hes at he started to have false memories about me and believe i was manipulating him i honestly weirdly think its because i was always honest with him hes used to people lying were low contact until he stabilizes enough to hold a conversation with me his extreme mental health episode is swinging the other way hes undiagnosed rn but the swinging has me having some ideas of what might be going on do you wish someone had told you did someone tell you how did they tell you what do i do
i have come to reddit for the communities opinion i am and so is my now ex girlfriend we met online and she thought i was cute so we started dating through are relationship that lasted around few months she had opened up to me about a few deep things i feel bad sharing it but i wont say anything about her so her identity is still covered anyways she had started telling me about her life she has been raped multiple times her mom was arrested because a bad boyfriend got her into drugs etc she opened up to me about one topic that truly stuck out and broke my heart but now im wondering who is telling the truth so my ex she had told me about many occasions of her being abused i have about screenshots of messages from her telling me about the living hell her dad and stepmom have been putting her through when she was her dad threw her off her bed and threw her into a barbie dream house and many occasions of her dad hitting her then her stepmom made it even worse she told me that it started when the stepmoms younger son wouldnt give my ex her stuff back he grabbed her stuff i believe makeup or her phone and wouldnt give it back so she took it from him she said she wasnt aggressive not like she threw him to the floor to get the item but her stepmoms reaction was a because of a situation that was max a so she said after her stepmom saw her then tackled her to the ground my ex said she tried defending herself by throwing a metal cup at her but it didnt work she said after her stepmom tackled her onto the tile floor she started yanking her head back and forth smashing her head against the floor she said her stepmom was on top of her and she was loosing chunks of hair because how she was pulling she ended up with a concussion went to the hospital told the nurse and since her stepmom acted nice they didnt believe her when she told me that i was literally on the verge of suicide and homicide because i was so upset anyways please tell me what i should do to help i tried telling cps multiple times and do even got an adult to call and i called back later and told them who called and they just did nothing my ex said she tried the police to etc i also believe it because someone from her school who she never talks to said she noticed some bruises and when she got the concussion she told everyone her and her friends had just been playing rough edit it was all lies she was a total liar
im f and i really need help and im so fucking lost i have abusive parents extremely esmily abusive parents so i contacted a child helpline who got into contact with my school and they contacted social services they told me they had to contact the police cus of the severity of the situation but theyre making jt worse they want to contact my parents and have a meeting and make them sign some papers however they dont understand that thats going to make it worse since my patents are going to get pissed at me when they get home and scream and beat me when i go home im so fucking worried about my safety and contemplating calling the police please help me decide what i should do n if i call the police what do i say
i stopped going to my dads a few months ago because my step mom hit me one night claiming i threatened my brother now i live with my mom and sometimes see my dad and two younger siblings when we go to eat at a restaurant or something that are and i want to stay in there lifes but how
i have a little brother thats much younger than me and still living with my narc father my father is emotionally and physically abusive to my mother i grew up with a messed up perception of relationships i would endure so much abuse since my brother is a male im worried he will grow up to be an abuser
i was verbally and physically abused by my dad from ages my parents divorced when i was in th grade and he moved out thats when it stopped i am now and he has entered a relationship with a new woman who has younger kids i cant tell if im projecting my past experiences with him but the way he talks to the kids makes me anxious and uneasy i dont know if its just in my head or not but whenever he talks to them i hear an aggressive and impatient tone like the one he used to speak to me in has anybody else had the same feeling and am i valid for feeling like this
it was a long time ago probably back during the late searly s when my father used to inflict physical abuse upon me he eventually changed however his behavior hasnt he now inflicts verbal emotional and psychological abuse onto me he calls me names he yells at me he yells swear words at me he makes fun of my interests and ruins my day etc and whenever i talk to him it seems like he plays the victim and compares how his parents used to beat him despite the fact that he was born in the s and i was born in its also not just towards me but also to my sister and stepbrother and he also does this when his wife my stepmom or any other adult is gone and talks smack about them behind his back i cant take this anymore i dont want to be with him what should i do especially since he often gaslights me into trusting him and how his wife and mother defend him
i apologize if i seem a little scattered right now this all happened today for some background i f have been living on my own with my husband for about months unfortunately we moved to an apartment and i could only take two of my cats i opted to keep my oldest cat cinnamon ginger cat where he was the most familiar he was very frail and wouldnt have tolerated being moved safely well my mom asked me to come over to help take care of some paperwork after she asks me she goes basically oh yeah cinnamon has been missing for a few days and i havent seen him i went over today to look for him and confirmed that she had not seen him in at least days we got into an argument over this which i recorded i will post the link here tw heavy language direct mention and innuendo of abuse after this argument i searched to no avail and decided to get something to drink and eat at home and for a chance to gather my feelings i went and looked a total of three times each time confronting my mother about where my cat was as well as the bubbling forces bottled up of all of the abuse ive experienced then the third time i went over i noticed what looked like a decomp stain on the carpet in the exact shape of a cat positioned in a th loaf as a cat does with its head touching the ground the stain alone wasnt enough for me to confirm exactly something told me to check outside i slowly waded through tall grass and jaggers on the property as its on an acre there i found a fresh square shaped grave that appeared to have sunken since the ground was damp my mother lied to me the whole time and my cat was unfortunately already deceased
not bothering with a throwaway because none of my family really use reddit and if they do i doubt theyre in this sub my m father m is abusive as all hell he hasnt been physically abusive since about two years ago though the brunt of it was before i was when he became too crippled to do much of anything now he sits on the couch all day listening to political youtubers loud enough for me to hear with headphones on from my room across the house heres a list of stuff that he did in the span of months emptied the bathroom trash can all over the floor because no one had taken it out yet during cleaning day cussed out my older sister f when she called him out on that hes always professed to be a christian who hates strong language like that this was the first time he had ever said fuck you to anyone in the house attempted to get me to physically fight him when i called him out on acting like a child and then laughed when i told him he wasnt worth it told my sister that he wants everyone who supports trans people to go to hell this includes all of his kids that still live with him and he later tried to step back saying he didnt mean us mocked me when i tried to calmly give him bible verses that preached against hate forced my mom f to cut contact off with her cousin because he thinks shell cheat on him with the guy this is gonna get more context in the body of the post because there is more information on this called my mother a whore after finding out she sold herself to make sure we could eat when we were toddlers trying to gaslight her into thinking that he didnt refuse to deal with any family finances during that time previously hes also ran off basically every one of his kids from his first marriage except for like including the one that i was actually close to i will give that his distrust of mom with her cousin does not come from out of nowhere they were sexting i know its disgusting none of us approve and he found out about a year and a half ago however he didnt ban her from talking to him then he didnt do that until two weeks ago after he had driven my sister out of the house because of how bad his behavior was specifically because he said that he thought she was planning on leaving him too he has consistently reprimanded my mom for unfaithfulness but all three of us were born while he was still married to his first wife and this entire relationship only started because of an affair he blames her for how long it took to get divorced when he was the one working at the time i want to get out of this house but im only a substitute teacher right now and theres very few career options at the moment we only have one working car two are broken down and one can only really go around town so getting a job outside of town isnt possible yet additionally i live in florida where housing is insanely expensive even above national averages because of how many people come down here to retire as stated earlier my sister tried leaving but she had no money saved up and got fired from the first job she got because her car wasnt clean she got a job as a pizza delivery driver and will likely need to come back here i dont want to repeat the same mistake and leave when i have no money i dont have many irl friends and none of them live in this town except for my brother in law who lives with us so i dont have an out for now any ideas for how to get out of here id need to basically leave the state in order to have a chance of affording a place

okay hi reddit this is my first post and its a lot but i need advice i just turned this april and have graduated high school the month after so im on my summer break right now before i start college and major in art to possibly become a ceramicist potter i dont currently have a job right now im trying to get one no ones been hiring or accepting me so its very hard atm but i wanna save up money and move out from my abusive parents and family and live my own life do whatever i want whenever i want and be with whoever i want basically just be free and start a new chapter of my life my parents are very religious people theyre muslim and worship islam and allah but im not so its hard to talk to them about certain things relating to my love life and sexuality im bi and trans but they dont know that im gay and have a boyfriend but they dont know that either if they did i would be homeless another thing to mention is that my parents are also bosnian so even more struggle theyre immigrants and came to america fleeing from the bosnian war that went on and they wanted to build us a life here so here i am they dont really let me go out a whole lot because they dont trust me with things from the past for example i missed some days at school bc i would skip but i still went and finished them catching me sneaking out of my window and house the excuses and lies i would give them and they constantly interrogate me and ask what im doing in my life theyre physically and mentally abusive and ive been having many hurtful evil and inhumane things said about me to my face from them along with some of my other siblings they comment about my appearance say that im not good enough and never will be how ill never meet anyone in life how i wont be successful in the future basically everything there is to say theyve said it to me theyve also said how they shouldve never gave birth to me and how it wouldve been better if i wasnt here my own parents too unbelievable but what can i possibly do about it lol move tf out and leave them for good my older sister turning moved from my parents bc they also found out that she had a boyfriend at the time and she didnt want this life so i helped her take her things out her window and said my goodbyes we still keep in contact and see each other today but she started saving her money when she was and i have some bad spending habits but ive been getting better at it and been realizing my wants and needs theyve cut off contact completely and dont speak or see each other she hasnt seen my parents in years but theyve known where she moved from and where she would go which is really scary and super stalkerish because idk why they care when shes an adult and has her own life with someone else super weird i dont want my parents to find out where my boyfriend lives or where ive been going so they can camp out and stalk me like they have before heres my situation recently i had a fight with my younger sister and our childhood friend who were really close with and theyve said many things about me and how they dont like the things i do like smoking weed with my bf and ive apologized for my mistakes and told them that i would be better from now on theyre not talking to me until theyve seen that ive changed i understand that but what they dont understand is what my boyfriend is like theyve never met him or talked to him once other than the stuff i tell them the good and bad my boyfriend and i have been facing some problems in our relationship recently but we always find a way to thoroughly communicate with each other and try to see what we both need to do better so that we dont make the same mistake again in the future ive been telling them about how i feel about the stuff he does not mentioning bc it doesnt matter but they think its best for us to completely break up and theyve been trying to separate us after weve been dating for over a year and this is the longest relationship ive ever had and the most happy and free ive ever felt from anyone else they think that hes a bad influence and that i can meet someone else in college but i dont wanna breakup and he doesnt either its just not happening with that my parents have been suspicious of me drinking or smoking weed because i went to the movies and took a couple edibles and they saw that i wasnt okay when i felt like i could speak and walk fine i dont have any weed or alcohol on me the only time i smoke weed is when im with my boyfriend and im not with him every day i can only hangout when both my parents are at work or go to a friends and even then i still sneak out and track where they are i can see on my messages where theyre at be you can send your location indefinitely but have to delete it from their recently deleted so they dont know ur tracking them you can track them but they cant track you ive been a lot more safer recently coming home before they do and been taking my car out sometimes because me and my boyfriend dont go on many dates but started to more recently they havent caught me until my younger sister told my mom that i always go out and she also started telling my dad in spite of anger when ive been trying to gain their trust back and have been in good terms with them no problems or suspicions until now since then my parents havent trusted anything i said or where i tell them im going when ive texted called facetimed sent own pictures to them and they still dont believe me all because of my younger sister who snitched my relationship with her is over shes told me how she feels and i told her how i feel but shes so hardheaded and doesnt understand what my life is like and doesnt wanna be in it anymore so ill let her make that choice but when i make a choice everyone gets in my way of it for why when i was at my friends house with her both of them went through my phone which isnt okay at all btw its privacy and basic respect why tf would you go through my phone when i wouldnt do that to you even if i was that upset lifelong childhood friend who i thought i could trust allowing this to happen btw and were looking at the messages between me and my boyfriend and said how disappointed they were in me because they think that i drunk and drove the night of the movies when i tried to explain to them that i didnt and they still didnt believe me i went to his house later that day to try and talk about what were gonna do i came unannounced he was confused and they kept calling me along with my parents asking what i was doing and i almost got hit about three times because i was stressed while driving and told them that the number one cause for crashesdeath when driving is texting and driving not drugs or alcohol or lack of sleep yes they can be contributors but its not the number one cause im also not that dumb enough to drink and drive i can kill myself and others and i know that i dont know why they wont believe me when ive told them the truth about taking too many edibles and how ive apologized and said that i would quit completely im gonna cut back a lot but im not doing it or talking about it around them anymore around anyone my friends smoke too but idk why its a problem when i do it im only trusting myself bc they made me realize that do not trust anyone no matter how much you love them or how long youve known them for because they will stab your back someday just like me im still smoking weed and doing what i want but barely than how much i was doing which wasnt even a lot btw but sure they think im some kind of crack head who has no money and looks for only weed in life when i dont need it at all and can walk away from it i just like how it makes me feel bc its relaxing and calming the only time i dont feel constant pressure and its my decision i dont see a big deal with it when my same friend vapes nicotine and posts tiktoks of her ghosting constantly when i dont do that in her car too but sure yeah im the high one driving dangerously when youve never been in the car with me and when you constantly vape and are with your boyfriend too i know that theyre worried for me and dont want me to get hurt or get a dui and go to jail but ive never drove high once and ive felt fine the whole time im a really good driver and my boyfriend agrees i took a driving class and know how to be safe on the road im not an imbecile after that i turned back around and went home my younger sister took my keys away from me threw a water bottle and spilt it all over my face yelling and crying and we had a talk later that night which she walked away from she said she doesnt know what to do anymore and i told her the same thing she wants me to go back to being the old me but people change and ive changed i love myself now more than ever not the past version of myself like people say the past stays in the past only focus on the present and future people are so worried about the past and future nobody really takes time to appreciate the present just slow down and live life to its fullest youre not in a rush and dont ever make yourself or anyone rush you recent situation i was hanging out with my boyfriend this morning because we go to this store every tuesday with cheap stuff they open at am but the line starts forming around am but i go to my boyfriends house before so i can see him and his dogs for a little bit before i leave my mom starts calling me around am asking me where i was she had to take my dad to work and i told her i was at the store but ofc she doesnt believe me and says that shes gonna go and see if im in there i quickly rush out and start driving trying to beat her he lives min away from me but about away from the store and i made it in line and she facetimes me i answer and she asks me to show her and i showed her and she believed me when i was about three away she was six and it was really scary because i didnt want her to see me on the road my bf met up with me later my mom never came to see if i was there but she came later before i left to give me money to put into my bank account bc i recently broke my phone and had to use my own money to pay for a new one but they didnt know until a couple days before she told me to go to the bank and go home after and that she would call my sister to make sure i was home at i went to chick fil a to eat breakfast with my bf and then went to the bank and to a thrift store across from us he left his car at chick fil a so i thought i could drive him because i checked where my mom was at and it said that she was at work she works at this was around but she was in the parking lot at the thrift store waiting for me and saw my boyfriend get out of my car she called me and was yelling telling me to come over there and we had about a minute talk in the parking lot about life and shit which i couldnt wait to get over i was freaking out we were both crying and she was telling me how she wanted to be nice and just have a good relationship with me but i go out and do this stuff to her and make her sick she had breast cancer last year but is healthy now and blamed it on me saying that i caused it on her and if im trying to kill her she asked if he was my boyfriend and why he was in my car i told her that i didnt know him and he just asked me if he could have a ride because he didnt have a car on him and i said sure because i wanted to do something nice when no one else would and he had a foot injury which he actually did she said that she understands that but i shouldnt take people in my car other than my sister when ive been driving for over a year and have had my license since october but ok months of having my full license and i still cant take anyone around but my little sister lmfaoo little do they know she said that she was gonna go inside and take a picture of him to send my dad he left before she went in there thank god a guy he knew drove him back to his car and my mom didnt see him again i think she was saying that to threaten me and that she didnt actually mean it bc i told her that she could go ahead lol its not like it matters bc idk him anyways and that he knows where i am at all times but doesnt wanna tell me how if i wanna move to just tell them and leave how she wants me to find a bosnian man and marry him most of them suck and have the same morals like my parents and cheat a lot and i already have someone in my life and how if she saw me dating that man in public she would rather see me in the ground on my deathbed than with him yes you heard that right my own mother who gave birth to me said that she would rather commit suicide than see her own child with a white american man she said she would rather kill herself than see us two together and when i heard that it fucking broke everything in me imagine hearing that from your mother looking right in her eyes too she asked me if i was lying and to swear on her life that i wasnt seeing him and i swore on her life and mine and i think she finally believed me she kept saying how she feels like im just covering up making some kind of story because im beautiful and how i need to find someone in the future and she said okay go home dont let this happen again after all of this nobody likes me being with my boyfriend when he tries to be there for me when he can but he knows how my parents are like and has apologized multiple times and wishes that i could live a normal life away from them and be with him and his family but i cant because i have a younger sister and brother to take care of and they wouldnt have anybody but themselves if i were to leave everyone is dependent on me when i try so hard to be independent and live my own life without anyone getting in the way of it but they still do no matter how hard i try im getting so exhausted and drained for having to live my whole life in pure fear and survival like when do i get to finally be happy and free and do what i want and come home and eat whenever i want have my own job and be a tattoo artist get an apprenticeship for that and actually start living my life why do people constantly have to make these decisions for me when i know myself better than anyone else and whats good for me my parents think that all the stuff i like rock heavy metal cowboys and westerns music ss rap clothes piercings tattoos are all satanic devil worshipping things even though its not but theyre too dumb to realize i cant even wear a crop top without being called a slut before i leave the house in one hundred degree weather but when someone with a smaller chest wears one its fine because its socially accepted and normalized but when i do it its not okay and im called a slut for it its so unfair and i cant keep getting mistreated and beat down in my young adulthood my best years i know that people are just trying to look out and want the best for me but going about it this way is so toxic and makes me fall heavier on depression everyone looking through my stuff my mom finding my empty flask of liquor that i drank from long before my cart my sex toys thongs lingerie all of it even when i clean my room she loves to dig for any secrets ive been keeping to find some reason to kick me out have one less mouth to feed i feel like nobody has been wanting me in their lives and feel like everything is my fault and that im the cause of it all when everyone else is living their life with no problems or theyre at least not thinking they did or caused anything onto me when theyre at fault too and im waiting for an apology back not to mention but i had a year anniversary post on my insta and they were texting saying how upset and betrayed they felt that i would choose him over them even though its not true and ive said that i didnt mean it to spite against them and i can see how it mightve come across that way they thought i was ignoring them but i didnt wanna read their messages bc i had so much on my mind and wasnt ready and i apologized i was originally planning to move out next summer so that i could get my first year of college done with and get used to my schedule and campus i have my whole first year payed for and i would be paying out of pocket for textbooks meals student loans etc in december i have a month long break where ill be working the whole time trying to save up i could move that monthsemester but i wanna try and get my first year of school done so i know how things work and am more familiar my dad sister and i had a long discussion about his plans for the future and he says that in four years hes taking my mom and brother and moving back to bosnia leaving me and my younger sister here ill be in my third year of college my sister will be a freshman in college and my brother will be a freshman in high school and my dad said that hes willing to give my sister and i the house because he knows that apartments are really expensive and how its dangerous living beside a bunch of strangers and how we were born and raised here so he more than understands and will give it to us to decorate however we want and to do whatever we want wed have our own garage backyard pool rooms etc that would be in or and i dont know if i can wait that long just to get a house with someone who i dont wanna live with just to get a year out of it paying for cheaper bills theres just no point in making my parents wait when my sister wouldnt wanna live with me by then and my parents wanting to take the money from selling the house if i go my first year at college and get financial aid and have my parents pay for the second year i could move out that summer and they wouldnt even have to know were planning on going to bosnia next year i think so that could be our last family trip together i could probably have a car by then my sister gets her full license in marchapril but idk if the title will be in my name bc i asked my dad about that and he said the only people who ask that question are people who wanna move out i have a car but its in my dads name so its technically his but if i dont i can get my own or drive my boyfriends car i dont know the first step of moving out if you have abusive narcissistic hypocritical parents like me or understand anything about how much you should have saved up what to look out for getting your own car transferring banks transferring mail addresses getting a credit card getting a new phone plan etc any advice would help should i move out this year or next year before things escalate and get worse i cant stay four years i know its better financially but i know that i cant hold out that long with the past trauma i already have i love my boyfriend so much and he wants to help me in every way to try and get me away from lifelong abuse and trauma i know that im young and it might be too soon moving in with him but i know that he would take the best care of me as i would do for him and wed have everything figured out and properly planned even if we run along problems later down the way well figure it out together and we made a promise to stay together and not leave each other for someone else as dumb as it is i love him and would do anything for him and he would do the same i could move in with his parents for a while until we find our own place or i could stay with his grandma or we can get an rvtrailer and live in there for a couple of months maybe we can build our own house in his backyard bc he has a smoke spot for himself so i have options ill have a roof above my head i only have about on me right now and i know it isnt enough to move out but im starting somewhere and ill have a thousand before hopefully at least k i move out since ill be getting a job soon he has way more money than i have and comes from a supportive family so if i told them my situation they would understand and try to help me since i have a good relationship with them and they like me they also have a family owned business and could get me a job right away id get paid more than i have before with my mom says that shes gonna ask my dad to retrieve all my phone numbers and messages and ask who ive been texting and calling when idk if he can check my messages but i know he can see my numbers would he still be able to check my messages if my carrier is tmobile or are they saying that just to threaten me if i changed my phone plan would they be able to know like get notified or something can they actually track my phone and see where i am at all times or are they lying about that too just another threat that i shouldnt take seriously or should i start taking them seriously i know a lot of parents say that as a threat but cant actually do it but my parents are very smart so idk if theyre lying about that or not my boyfriend and i have told people that were breaking up bc we know thats what everyone wants but were just taking a break from each other for a couple of months and keeping things on the downlow so that nobody suspects anything were still gonna see each other sometimes but the only difference is that i cant have my own sister knowing because she could be the whole reason of why or if i get kicked out i dont wanna get kicked out because of the man i love being with and the quick harsh judgment from others please help with anything you have
im going to tell what happened to me f because i no longer wish to cover up for anyone all my life i suffered verbal and physical abuse from my mother she blamed me because according to her when i was born her exhusband showed his claws and began to mistreat her i tried to help her the best i could believing that once we were alone everything would be different but it wasnt like that she blamed me for making her report him and would get furious with me for no reason saying i had promised her she would be happy without him after a painful breakup with an abusive man similar to my mother i decided i didnt want to live like that for the rest of my life then i met a man m who seemed good knowing about the abuse he proposed living with himand his parents his father kept to himself but his mother was very intrusive all our arguments were about her never our relationship one day after an incident with his mother he raised his fist at me while driving and accelerating a car that wasnt even his but his mothers it was traumatic he always said i had traumas because of my mother but he generated that trauma in me my heart broke because the man who was supposedly loving and protecting me had the intention to hurt me the worst part is he blamed me for everything he insists hes not violent that ive pushed him to the limit im still affected and cry every time i remember it im no longer with him i live with a friend and dont have the problems i had at his mothers house i wasnt the problem its true i need to heal but he has serious problems as well i dont want him back i just want to heal to have a good relationship claude can make mistakes please doublecheck responses
officially going no contact with my cheating narc father i posted on another forum but i need all the advice i can get i finally confronted him after years of him cheating on and emotionally and physically abusing my mother and his responses were sure you had such a difficult childhood i dont know how you survived and its none of your business i just want to feel validated will he ever admit the truth and why does he stay married to my mother when he clearly doesnt love her
note im mother or smth my older sister is younger brother is ive been confused recently and its just the situation i was placed under and how it is altering events recently i tried to commit due to my mothers outburst as she destroyed everything i had including my clothes my art and my items within my room this was all because of me being myself in dressing the way i wanted to note that in the past she has been aggressive and abusive including starving me calling me a whre or any other derogatory terms she never loved me and always told me i was never part of this family so i decided to do her a favor and remove myself permanently i was on the verge of overdose and i tried my hardest to just pass out but i decided to talk to my counselor that i was going to commit leading me to the doctors trying to take the toxins out of me when they were allowed to visit no one came besides my aunt who was there and said if my mother did not accept me as her daughter she was always there for the first time i realized my mother never treated me like her own child like she treated her other two other children my mother did eventually come but all she did was tell me that it was my fault for being here and she shouldve just talked it out when i had the chance and she was not really that mad she only said that because she did not want to cause a huge fuss over what happened in front of everyone it was so fake i believed it though cause i just wanted closure even if it was fake i ended up going to the phyceward for a stay but when i was gone it got worse my brothers noted that i called her a btch for the longest time as if they never said told her that when i was there she did try her hardest to get me out of that situation and put me on track because they were thinking about putting me there longer knowing that made me feel like she might be ok and accept me but when i got out i was ready to meet them all it was like this wash of reality that i did not know them and it all seemed clear that it was just fake talk for a while to make me feel safe but in reality it was not she made it clear that i am not her daughter and i do not address her as a mother she made me apologize to her about the lack of respect but not once did i hear her say sorry for the torture and abuse she put me through she made me starve beat me around till i bled forced me to separate from my grandparents and forced me to not have friends bc she was scared i would go around and tell there is more to that list but those were the only things i wanted her to know that she did to me no she wants an apology for the circumstance she put me through and i needed a release of anger and took it out like that she is no mother she is some monster i deal with sure she may have given me all this but at what cost she did this to herself and now i am turned out like this all at her expense its worse now my siblings have separated from me because its too much for them to handle when i talk about my mother and tell me to go get therapy when i was in that phyceward they promised me itd get better and be there for me when i was out they isolated me shut the door off and went out with their friends and did not even talk to me once because i had to learn a lesson its been harsh and i gave up on this entire family and already accepted that i am no longer part of this family all i want is peace and be able to live freely so im planning on leaving next year and never looking back at them ive been lashing out in anger now at them and i dont know how to control it when i see them they get me so annoyed and disgusted ive been putting guilt on for just existing but now i want to understand if my anger is justified now or am i being dramatic am i even allowed to give up on them or should i still try my older sister is offering therapy but complains she needs to save up i dont even know anymore im so lost in what to do with this family and how to be a part of it if theirs even a chance
hi im non binary and have struggled with anxiety depression and undiagnosed learning disorders for years i moved out of my house to live with my boyfriend and its been wonderful but right now im on a trip with my mother overseas im on the autism spectrum and my parents dont believe me especially my mom she constantly ignores me when i ask for accommodations such as staying home for a day or needing to go to the mental hospital she refused to take me on this trip i had about enough of this type of treatment she yells at me all the time treats me like im the worst thing to happen to her threatens to slap me calls me names such as a shit ass child and i constantly have to be careful about what i say to her because i never know if shes going to be angry with me she yells at me when i slightly disagree with her or tell her i need help i used to be afraid to get in her car for the fear of being yelled at i could never tell how she was going to react she disregards my feelings for her own she said parenting doesnt come with an instruction manual i finally snapped on this trip i had huge meltdowns and all my mom had to say to me was this trip was expensive and that im ungrateful which im not im very thankful that i get to travel just not thankful that its with her she said to me last night that she doesnt know who i am anymore and maybe its the medication but youre not my daughter again im non binary and have told her this multiple times i yelled at her last night telling her that shes the reason i act like this i couldnt take it anymore and i just yelled and screamed and told her all of the shit she did that messed me up i cant remember a good portion of my childhood anymore now shes upset and will most likely blame me for ruining the trip all she had to say to me was im sorry i ruined your life and cried and complained that she was sick i dont know if i did the wrong thing or not i feel bad but i dont im tired of being treated like my best is never good enough for her my grades my attitude everything i told her she needed to go to therapy because she has some unresolved issues she needs to take care of but she doesnt think she does aita or was this bound to happen
did that get to anyone else my dad told me that after my mom was screaming at me all day and chasing me around shoving me like she would do all the time i believed it for a while and it really drove in my depression farther but ive recently been thinking about it realized that my cat loves me plenty so its proven false now i hope that someday a human could too but i know it still wont happen if i cant get past my mental issues has anyone else here been told that theyll never be loved as much as their abusive mother does and had it get to them
im writing this because i need to know that i am not the only person who is living it its hard for me to open up but i finally reached to this point where i need to hear others opinions my dad left when i was very young my mom developed a rare neurological condition that almost paralysed and killed her theres no cure for this illness and its very progressive that was years ago ever since my dad left my mom needed financial support and the only way she was able to get it was through the help of her brother a very controlling inconsiderate hurtful person who never let us live throughout those years my moms mental health was getting worse she started abusing pills and smoking cigarettes in insane amounts of course she was spending the money where it shouldnt be spent my dad lived with his parents and was secretly married his family always pushed us away to a point where they actually cut us off completely of course my dad never stood up for us back then so we were very much involved in my mothers family because again her illness is progressive it got worse and worse recently we spent the past years of our life in hospitals and er saving her life because she has now multiple illnesses of course our health was and still is neglected and our needs were never addressed the focus was always on saving her life she is very unhealthy doesnt have a basic understanding about her illness and doesnt chose what is best for it she is that self destructive shes disabled and cant be left on her own me and my siblings put our lives education and future on hold to be able to save her but her brother sees otherwise he keeps blaming us controlling us and holds us in to not do anything ever that would take us away from them he knows that she is irresponsible but keeps feeding her self destruction and whenever it goes wrong we get abused for it years of inconsideration years of neglect and control years forced to take all of the responsibility years of not even being able to express thoughts or opinions because we grew up tip toeing intimidated and living under the mercy of people who dont know logic and so many other details im so scared of traumas i will be finding out about later on if i ever get the chance or the space to take care of myself

im and my mother was horrible in the sense she put herself and her children through immense stress and trauma for making bad decisions i grew up listening to their fights with my step father anxiously aware of when her attitude had change even slightly and spending the rest of the day having to deal wirh her and knowing she was going to blow up with me or my father and later with me as you can imagine this is just the tip they luckily never were physically abusive but i wish they had been instead of everything else they did im a hermit i have no social life no hobbies no life plan or goal i began contemplating suicide from early adolescence and i lived life waiting to die because i just couldnt picture my life changing for the better with the years this issued have just compounded and my mothers attitude changed she has read a lot of spirituality of the soul the journey the psychology of letting go of the hurt to grow stronger and a bunch of other shit all basically leading up to now where she sends me video after video after tiktok after tiktok all about your parents did what they could but now you are older and you need to see they werent so bad and find a job all while avoiding the fact im fucked up in ways that make it impossible for me to just man up like she so pushes me to do ive had fights with her for for a decade by now about this i wish i could leave here that i could find a job but i get panic attacks from just being in public spaces and simple arguments and discussions make me so weak that i start to tremble and sweat but she never stops gaslighting me that everybody has anxiety they just deal with it and go to work i just wish i could say something to change this situation if i could id live in s shoe box just to get away from his house

im a f firstgeneration immigrant who grew up in the uk with south asian parents my upbringing was harsh and i often wished for different parents between the ages of and my father would force me to memorize times tables using tree branches to hit me when i made mistakes i hid this abuse from my teachers because i feared the consequences at home and didnt want my parents taken away my parents downplayed my feelings and discouraged me from making friends claiming they hindered success which in turn made it difficult to socialisein high school i struggled with my home life and contemplated suicide eventually i pushed myself to make friends and become more confident i love my younger sibling m immensely but fell into the trap of acting as a third parent being responsible for his school work and behaviour at a young age at i moved out to create a life for myself and set boundaries with my parents but i now struggle with hyperindependence despite my efforts to please my parents i always feel like its never enough and that i am to blame when things go wrong i visit my parents every few months to maintain a connection with my sibling but their negativity takes a toll on me despite the trauma i work in healthcare providing rehab to mental health patients and find fulfillment in this i have a supportive longdistance partner who helps me heal however he holds a negative view of my parents which makes me feel guilty i feel emotionally exhausted and traumatized at i often vent to a close friend who understands but we dont know how to find a solution while i have received counselling in high school and learned to set boundaries further therapy and medication dont appeal to me i acknowledge that my parents have made mistakes but i dont believe they can change i struggle with showing and receiving affection from them and resent the fact that i had to mature too quickly i want to move forward with strategies from others that have similar trauma in order to avoid feeling terrible whenever i see my parents i want to break the cycle and have healthier relationships thanks in advance

i was raised in an upper middle class household i never had to really worry about money when i was younger so i always felt i was blessed around th grade my father began to show signs of mental health deterioration he was an alcoholic and always in a terrible mood he wasnt too physical with me unless it was for normal parental discipline but it was an absolute pain to be around him he would often fake punch me when i walk past him like a fucking kid and one time he got me on my nose and naturally i got mad at him and instead of apologizing or anything at all he yelled at me for yelling at him i would rarely ever even attempt to talk to him on a daily basis because it would always end in him getting angry and staring angrily deep into my soul and trying to belittle me the most annoying example is when i would try to give him advice it was like a fucking sin for me to try to give this dude advice since i was a kid and he was an adult it really pissed me off when it would smoke he would smoke packs of cigs a day and then come inside and start kissing my dog it made me stay away from my dog because then they would both end up wreaking of cigarette smoke one time i asked him if he could maybe wash his hand and rinse his mouth after smoking before touching the dog after i worded it kindly with a positive tone and wasnt being confrontational and he flipped out on me and made it such a big deal saying that it was disrespectful for me to tell him to change something he was doing this stuff got really bad during covid but sort of in a different sense my dad stopped antagonizing me i think its because i had a pretty big growth spurt and i was putting on a decent amount of muscle so he couldnt intimidate me like he used to so he basically stopped communicating with me all together we lived in the same house for about two years straight without a full conversation this was so fucking weird i almost would have rather been yelled at than this we would still see each other around the house but he would just stare me down without a word as almost as if he were trying to intimidate me i would always try to avoid him around the house sometimes i would wake up and not go downstairs on weekends to avoid him and just listen through my door and wait for him to leave or go somewhere during covid i would either stay in my room or the basement for multiple days at a time only coming out for food and water my parents got divorced literally right when i turned i dont even care about the implications behind this but this is when my real depression started i was already riddled with anxiety before the stuff with my dad and that stuff just made it much worse and then going to college on top of all of this had me in a terrible place i thought about my relationship with my parents a lot during this time and started to think that i was the problem i would rationalize my fathers actions thinking that he was just really depressed and upset that nobody was helping him with it thus causing him to resent his family the sad part is that the only reason i even thought that maybe thats what he is going through is because that is how i started to feel i love my mother but i also always resented her for never caring about my mental health ever since i was a little kid i had these anxious tics where i would scrunch my face uncontrollably my mother would always yell at me for this my father surprisingly didnt care or even acknowledge this like ever she was call it a bad habit that i needed to stop and i always wanted to tell her that i couldnt control it i learned over time to not do it in public but still to this day im now and a rising senior in college i do it when im alone sometimes now for the resolution of this long ass post the mixing of memories once my father left im at the time and a freshmen in college it was just my mom and my sister i was super depressed and i remember i would either act out and be super bland and whenever i was home for breaks i didnt realize this at the time but i believe i did this as a way to try to get my mom to acknowledge anything about my mental health i started smoking weed in the house the summer after freshman year of college this was a pretty strict house and i had never once ever even so much as cursed out loud so this finally made her say something but this kind of upset me even more because all she did was suggest i go to therapy the thing is my mother seems to care a lot about me at times she makes sure i am fed well she works her ass off to help pay the interest for my tuition and cooks me nice meals every once in a while and it makes me feel like such an asshole to resent her i still love her so much but i cant really tell if i am truly wrong for this i didnt read this post over so i hope it even makes sense also this is my first reddit post ever an i have never told anyone about my family life not even any of my closest friends i didnt even talk to my mother about feelings immediately after the divorce and it was treated like any other day i feel like im losing my mind sometimes keeping all this shit in i feel like my friends wont take it seriously if i tell them i mean there are so many other kids who are beaten by their parents and have no money and i feel like shit when this stuff makes me depressed am i crazy
to give background i got a lease with my mother in a two bedroom apartment when we first got it both of our names were required to be on the lease agreement a year later i got into law school i left late august and the lease was up in october when that time rolled around she begged me to sign for another year so i did i came back for christmas break and everything was fine when i came home for summer she moved someone into my room this individuals name is not on the lease and is a ex felon when i came home all of my stuff was gone through and multiple things were unaccounted for since being home my mother and i have been arguing most every night i dont like my stuff being touched but that keeps happening the individual is up at all hours keeping me awake and when i get upset about it they both act like i am dramatic basically my mom says nothing and lets him run the house and do whatever he wants i have started a job at the airport and have crazy hours and need my sleep but he will be up cooking steak at in the morning they are both great at playing the victim something that blew my mind was i was woken up and the grwn man had his mother come over and have my mother and i talk things out i did not ask for this and did not say she can move this in in my legal binding contract she claims its to help her get on her feet with finances but she does not work all but two days a month i feel disrespected and uncomfortable in my own house i dont know what to do they are good at making me seem crazy in their minds i should work crazy hours while they sit around all day and all night and do whatever they want including dealing with a smell of a strong burning substance that filtrates through the whole houseand i should keep my mouth shut my food and drinks are also always being taken and eaten my car was also stolen a few days after coming home so i have been working hard to get myself another car so money is tight right now now again i dont know what to do im trapped until august i also dont think it is healthy to continue a relationship with my mother because not only has this situation put a strain on my relationship with her i have caught signs of drugs she has put me in a situation that i dont think any mother should do she has defended him and sided with him she has put me in a situation where if the complex finds out i can be in some serious trouble but she doesnt think about me but him first she almost got us evicted from this apartment for refusing to work and pay rent and i dont think they would hesitate to kick all of us out if they found out which means i could not get an apartment to head back to law school i think what she is doing is selfish and if she knew she could not afford it she should not have renewed this lease i am constantly told by her to go to hell to go fuck myself etc any advice or comments are appreciated also i am starting to lose my temper
i went no contact with my parents last year after my mother went on a tirade because she was jealous of other people in my life there were good moments with my parents in my childhood but also a lot of bad and scary moments my mom is an alcoholic most likely narcissistic or bpd and my dad has anger issueslow emotions my mom was obsessed with me she would say she was jealous of boyfriends for being able to touch me friends etc she has tried to blackmail me in the past she kicked me out once because i told her i couldnt come see her during my college finals there was also an element of sexual abuse but i am trying to be vague so its not too obvious my mom texted me again today asking me if there is any hope for our relationship i think she desperately wants a relationship with me but every time in the past that ive tried it has ended badly the second i set boundaries she loses it and claims i cant hold things from the past against her my heart breaks to know she is hurting i dont want that and i think everyday about the pain its the last thing i want but i do not think it is healthy for me to be around her being around her puts me on edge my nervous system still reacts to her as it did when i was a childundergoing the abuse im so much happier and healthier the last year of my life and the only thing that changed was removing them has anyone ever reconciled and it actually worked how did you know you were ready
i left the house hold i am free but it still hurts i thought the pain would go as soon as i left but it hurts worse now im glad i am not in the fire but now its like i am noticing the burns i didnt before what do you guys do to cope i am starting to get depressed again and its scaring me cause last time i got depressed i couldnt sleep i couldnt wake up i couldnt eat i was vomiting randomly i had a seizure i was self harming i was unmotivated i had constant headaches i just felt horrible i feel tired i am starting to feel like that again i always watched porn to make things better to feel better but i had gotten out of that cycle i dont feel like i need it anymore except lately i have felt that way it hurts i dont want to hurt this is why i left i dont get it i dont know what to do it just hurts its getting worse because it got better does anyone understand this
im beginning to realize some of this stuff isnt normal the root seems to be my parent i am a male in my teens and my parent is a good kind man but hes often angry and says and does stuff sometimes that i now realize he shouldnt do somewhat unpredictable for example i remember him giving my little brother a nosebleed by a punch or picking me up by the shirt and pinning me against the wall hes also said some stuff like we both are good at using charm to get what we want out of others i didnt think to much of it at the time and other stuff like threatening to break legs or jab us in the throat this stuff has made me a very apathetic and cold person causing me to hurt animals and sometimes people due to my very strong impulsei know i am a terrible person i just need to put this here before i delete this account i have parental controls on my phone so who knows what might happen but back to the title sometimes my brothers my dad and me will joke about killing the dog my little sister loves by leaving her out in the street or just killing her in some other way she is very sensitive and cares a lot about animals i just realized that this is hurting her and every time she complains about we all tell her to be quiet and stop being sensitive i realize that this is a very evil thing to say now i do not feel bad for this but i realize this is wrong i know i am not a great brother i dont need to be told this i am honestly looking for some form of reassurance im not sure am i lying to myself this stuff is normal to me
i wish i was exaggerating but yes today years of breeding propagating plants and thousands of dollars has all gone to waste because my mom thought my room smelled bad i owned fish tanks all bigger than gallons stocked with every type of fish you can imagine i had recently gotten a new set of cory catfish for from a breeder my mom really didnt like them because of their whiskers so i think that fueled some of it today i went to school and came home to empty fish tanks and some broken glass i screamed and ran to my mom asking her what happened she told me she just cleared up my room for me and i should be thankful all fish including my foot long catfish were flushed my plants and coral were thrown away and my fish tanks broken no i cant just start again because some fish are hybrids you wouldnt find anywhere else
i grew up with tons of abuse from both parents theyre both awful people i dont hate them but we havent spoken in three years and i dont miss them one bit nor do i feel love or connection towards them is this normal i look at my boyfriend and how he has an actual family that he loves and feels connected to they fight sometimes sure but its different my family just felt empty and lonely and like there was never love but rather just used each other for attention seeking is this normal i feel like an outsider and dont understand the concept of family even a little bit
im new here and ive been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now i grew up in an asian household that took education and grades very seriously i was punished or demeaned whenever i did something bought home a slightly lower grade or perhaps did something that my mother wasnt very fond of no matter how small i open the fridge for a second i get nagged at dont leave the fridge open what the hell is wrong with you youre adding to my already high electricity bill as an example however whenever i do accomplish something i dont recall ever being praised for it ive always been ignored whenever i did something my mother wanted me to accomplish get a job okay i got a job but its not enough because im not making enough money to her standards i tried so hard to get a sense of recognition from her shes told me several times to kill myself because i didnt want to go to college or that i was a horrible useless person for choosing community college she wanted me to go to a prestigious university i worked my ass off at community college took credits and obtained my associate degree within a year because she didnt want me to stay at community college i ended up getting accepted to my dream school also the school my mom wanted me to attend i also applied and ended up getting a scholarship worth k basically giving me a full ride scholarship to any university in the us and guess what no recognition no congratulations nothing just yeah thats expected of you despite the fact she insisted on me going to college in the first place it just seems like nothing i do is enough to her no matter what i do i feel empty despite my successes in life i still feel worthless and all that ive accomplished is done for nothing she never showed up to my graduations either due to commitments to work because she needed money i should feel happy for myself i should feel grateful for all that ive accomplished but no i feel nothing i feel empty alone and sad i recently got a summer internship that pays k a week which would add up to a k annual salary but it still means nothing to her she doesnt care tldr no matter how much i accomplish my mom doesnt and never will give a shit about anything i do

im not rlly a redditor so sorry if the formatting on this is weirdbut like the title says i need help im years old soon to be the entirety of my life ive dealt with multiple kinds of abuse physical sexual you name it this also includes cosca both incesteous and non incestuous stalkingharassment public humiliation caused by my mother and just a whole long list of things that ive dealth with for years upon yearsim autistic and have been very self aware from a young age i was also always alone because i was homeschooled and i made the decision a long time ago that i wanna leave my mother created a bank account with me pnc specifically but has withheld the account information from me so im not able to log into my own account i want to create a new bank account when i turn because im leaving and i want her to have access to me or my moneybut how do i go about this exactly i have my own personal information such as my social security the actual card itself and my id but i dont know if thatll be enough for pnc to let me close my account without her there what if they say she has to be present for the account to be closed what do i do then and how could i possibly create a new bank account if i cant close the old one pls anybody who has an answer help me i want to get out of here i have a plan but thats one of the big things that im worried about i dont want her taking all the money ive saved up tldr my abusive mother has access to my bank account since im a minor how do i close the account when im without her being present
dont know if this is the right place to say this but i have a really shitty experience to write about here from age literally to im guessing around years old really cannot remember how or when it stopped my parents specially my mom abused is what i would interpret it as on paper me and my sibling nah not a few slaps in the face twice a year mom had mental health issues and serious stress and i guess ended up taking out most of it on my sibling and i in the form of excessive scolding get pissed off at everything beating up throwing stacks of books on us and just you can guess the rest a little scary part is that i only have fragments of vivid memories from this period of time and my dad from what i can remember never even once tried to stop his wife from beating his kids just watched silently with a blank look on his face still remember that look although i dont neccesarily feel anything about it just ah right okay thats how it is not disappointed just okay fast forward years later probably by the time i was none of my parents really hit me or anything anymore i dont remember feeling relieved i wasnt even doubtful or scared in the first place because that was all i ever knew from my house hold i realised that my parents actually grew to be kind thoughtful and supportive people fuck i dont know how to explain this my mom would express guilt and apology to us as we were kids as if that meant anything to us we didnt even recognise it as abuse back then now when sometimes that comes to topic my mom plays victim by basically bringing up how mentally she was struggling that time thats fine i wont protest because i dont want to discuss this ever with her but i cant help but find myself in a rare state mad that my parentss abused my sibling and i not because it left me with a permanent emotional scar not because it damaged a fundamental period of growth in my life as a person but because right now they look so happy my dad and my mom theyre so happy and in love right now and its not like that doesnt make me smile but on the back of my head i think like so you guys can just seem so genuinely happy after comitting such sin just dont understand the guilt mechanism here like how do yall live w yourself bruh thats crazy moms always a victim because of how much health issues she has i get it let it be so but i sometimes want to let them know whatever hapiness they have right now is not deserved id normally say deep down i just want to talk to my parents about it and get myself a proper apology i think they would and get it over with but no not really i dont want to talk i dont want an apology i dont want no heartfelt reconcile thing i will forgive but its too late to forget their abuse shaped me into something i hate to be and while i deal with that they get to enjoy the rest of their lives next to the love of their life how unfair how unjust but thats how i tell myself it is what it is
i recently got in a fight with my brother and my mom my mom and i were arguing and she was yelling at me for failing to redo a assignment which i got a in we were both shouting and my brother came up to hit me for shouting at my mom this has happened once before but i really deserved ut back then he told me to take off ny glasses to slap me but i resisted so he took it off forcefully and started slapping me i got so angry that i kicked back this really made my brother mad and he started punching me in my head my face and my body i want to remind you that he is and im my brother is really a hypocrite and is pretty much the house dissapointment he started choking me and i look over at my mom and shes not even feeling sad but she looked mad at me i have calmed down in my room and im debaing wethere i should ask my school for help or i really dont know what to do
so my girlfriends mother is very abusive and i dont know what to do her dad knows about this but hardly does anything about it both of her parents are very strict and our relationship is secretive multiple times her mother has said that she wished her dead and she tried to drown her in a bathtub my girlfriend also has a heart condition and it gives her pain along with asthma so her mom exploits that by making her do exercises at night up until months ago this her mother was perfectly normal and loving and just overnight her mother became a whole different person her dad and brother doesnt help her at all i dont know what to do she insists that she has it handled and wont let me call cps or the cops she also doesnt seek any help with this or talk to her therapist please help i dont know what to do and im afraid that her mom might seriously injure or even kill her
for some context im an adult f who hasnt lived with my abusive dad since i entered my s however i still have to see him every few months for the usual holidays and every time it just fills me with dread my dad is not a good person but someone who is incredibly good at putting on the front of being caring and compassionate when it works in his favor he has self admitted to doing incredibly nasty and awful behaviors inorder to manipulate people so he can keep them in his life and abuse them without using the words manipulate or abuse of course but acts like any of the same behaviors directed at me are just simple overreactions or misunderstandings so i know he is a compulsive liar on top of that he has mentally physically and sexually abused multiple people at this point including minors and at one point i was so scared of him that i sincerely thought he would kill me so i moved out and never went back to living with him but despite all of that i have now distanced myself from him greatly and only see him a handful of times a year and i just cant bring myself to cut him off theres a few reasons i suspect for this like him making life harder for siblings him attempting to stalk me him trying to make my divorced mothers life harder him threatening to commit suicide or even actually committing suicide but in any other situation like this i would still highly encourage someone and probably would have already left without looking back why is it so insanely hard to do this with parents especially abusive ones we know just absolutely suck as people why do i have to worry so much about him retaliating it feels like im playing house with an abuser and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about especially know everything hes done up to this point if anyone here has cut off a parent like this any input would be so greatly appreciated im tired of being stuck in this loop with him i want him so badly out of my life but feel so mortified at the idea of actually removing him and dont have a clue how to do it as safely as possible i dont even introduce my partner to this man because i dont want them to ever even speak to him
and sometimes feel as if im stuck in my year old self react to things the same way depressive mood swings no trust in anyone older than me i despise them beyond words but every day im fed the same bullshit of they didnt starve you and you had an education why are you complaining im this close to leaving everything behind and working at an oil rig or something even if my health makes it life threatening

so this situation is currently in motion and is being worked on and the end is near as im typing this so i should start from the beginning i guess so me m and my f gf started dating in february of this year currently but starting talking in december of and back then i asked about her parents and always heard very little about them when the parents conversation was brought up but when we started dating she really opened up to me about her situation and i should add that currently its not just her in danger but its also her little brother m that is living with this but anyway i dont know where to start with just her dad alone m so in late february when we were like two weeks into dating we were gonna tell them and then they found out anyway and he wasnt that mad but questioned me about it obviously and i explained to him what our situation was that we only just started dating and i would like to meet him and her mother and discuss all of this which we did and all was fine until she started telling me that they both have called her a whore a bitch a slut and words like that and ive heard this first hand and they both have put there hands on her multiple times including slapping her choking her and kicking her into her room most of this stuff happened around the ages and still continues today occasionally but she mostly is being called slurs consistently and here comes the more disgusting and sexual abusetendencies part of this cluster fuck so in mid to late april we had a pregnancy scare and we tried to hide it because we knew they would kill us both but they ended up finding out and her dad as we expected lost his mind he started trashing the house and as soon as he found out he put his hands around her throat and called whore as usual and then the worst part comes up after he did that he then made her sit down and tell him exactly how we had sex what position we did it in how long it lasted and if she had a orgasm or not and in the past she has had a series of different encounters with him involving stuff that seems to be a sexual manner such as her taking a shower and him walking in and ripping the curtain open and looking her up and down for several minutes she asked him for privacy and he told her no and i dont know if this is worth anything but in march at the time i was in georgia i live in arizona i was visiting my sister as she just moved out and me and my gf were talking and she texted me pictures of her and the whole family in car and his phone connected to the car and started playing double penatration porn not to mention as i said the little brother was in the car but thats just a little fraction in this shitcicle but recently she was allowed to spend time over here at my house and she got a call from her dad asking her what time she was coming home and she said probably around pm and he started saying that he doesnt know his daughter anymore and shes always out of the house and shes no longer allowed over there there being my house and needs to be home no later then so then i took her home and a few hours go by and then my dad gets a text from her dad that was along the lines of you people are taking my daughter away from me and turning her against me and manipulating her and encouraging her to run away and then my mom got really really mad at this situation and called him and i should add my girlfriend tells me and my family everything she really trusts us but anyway my mom called him out on all of this she called him out on the threats to separate us and the calling his daughter a whore which he admitted too and said she deserves it and the abuse in the past and he spoke in a calm tone through out all of it while my mom was screaming at him and after that my gf has been looking into emancipation because she has self harm scars from this situation and and she has openly admitted she cant do it anymore and is considering suicide or running away but here where some hope shines in my dad at his work has met a person who specializes in foster careemancipation for kids and is helping us through this entire situation and we have told him about most of the stuff going on and he really believes we have a case but it goes way deeper than just emotionalphysical and possible sexual abuse he did a background check on her dad and found he is a former felon and has currently multiple different alias and has a confirmed name change but also but thats not even the start of it for some reason i had to add a pole idk why view poll
for the record if you live with your parents rent seems fair you live in the house you pay for part of its upkeep and supply my problem is stated above but on top of that she permanently raised my rent because my week was a blur and i forgot to pay she acts as if im living in a real apartment and gets huffy if i question it ive been paying her was once in rent and to for utilities since marchish of last year what set off my alarm bells was seeing our electric and water bills and realizing my near could cover at least part of those bills also our house itself is fully paid off i hope im just being oversensitive but the whole thing feels fucky
when i was a kid my dad used to abuse me alot he was very strict on my education everytime i would make a small mistake he would threaten to break my bones by punching me so hard as i grew older he became worse when i was i was so close to calling the cops on my dad since he was also hitting my mom but i ended up not doing it becuz my mom would scare me about foster care and i did not want to be separated from my siblings she even said that if we ever go to court she will lie for my father and protect his identity it made me so mad after all these years my dad has gotten better he had some character development i am now and i still have to live with my parents the problem is my trauma is catching up to me and affecting me in my daily life i always think i dont feel safe at home i freeze up if my dad asks me something and i refuse to go to the living room if hes there how do i get better
i was taking out my kids friends for a fun afternoon park ice cream parlor and when it came time to drop off said friend she refused to leave the car and insisted on coming home with us i do know child comes from a home with issues but i never heard of a little kid not wanting to go home after a long tiring day the abusive must be so extreme she is terrified to go home eventually she agreed to leave the car after promised a bribe by a sibling what do i do my mama heart is so sad for this little girl
this happened on fathers day this sunday and i only got my phone back to talk about it anyways my little sistes hate me so they try anything to get me in trouble on fathers day i snapped at them for something and then they went to tell my parents but then my mom decided to escalate it bringing up things from like years ago to prove that im a bad child to my dad has a short temper so he got mad and screamed at me and started to chase me down he then pushed me down stairs and screamed that hes going to kill me over and over i was curled up into a ball at the bottom of the stairs crying saying if he wants to kill me do it my mom and grandma was trying to protect me my mom was acting like an angel as if she didnt instigate the whole thing she does this everytime he was hitting me so hard that my mom made me run into he basement and lock the door after everything cooled down my mom comes into the basement asking me in a rude tone for my phone saying im a bad child and that my dad works jobs for all my foolishness afterwards she kept on saying im bipolar and should go to an asylum i hate this soo much everyone blames me and it was worse because when my dad was saying he wanted to kill me while i curled up my little sisters were laughing and pointing now they keep on bringing up mocking me sorry if this is worded wrong my head still kinda hurts
im panicking and want to talk to some pls
to start after what happened between us and the the type of person my mom is it makes sense for her to get it covered up ive recently come to terms that my mom is not my mom anymore and as much as i should not give a fuck i feel my inner child sobbing to summon up our conflict my mom was in an abusive relationship for ongoing years me and my three younger sisters had to witness and endure my stepdadsyounger sisters fatherabuse when i got to an age where i was aware of what was going on and how wrong it was i started standing up for my mom my sisters and myself long story short my mom didnt like that and we spent the last four years on and off during that time my mom went actually crazy and instead of protecting us became another abuser she was my first fightweve had four physical fights ive reported her three times to dcfs and the first two social workers absolutely horrid after my mom had fought my at the time fifteen year old sister as a forty five year old grown ass woman i called again with a verrrrry small sliver of hope and we hit the fucking jackpot our social worker believed us and supported us with so much care my grandparents now have temporary custody of my three younger sisters and my mom and my sisters dad have scheduled and monitored meeting and talking times it would take way too long for me to get into the detail of the abuse and the effects of it today im just giving some background of why im here rn ik that some may not believe me or see me as a spoiled ungrateful kid i have to find the time and mindfulness to unpack those memories im gone and keep yapping too much so im just going to say believe me or not i know what i went through damn after all that i lowkey feel better lol but ik im still gonna feel hurt over it i dont want to just think abt the bad times to feel better but to acknowledge and work on healing that part of myself because im getting older i want to grow and heal from the past and move forward in a different light i just want to ask those who have been in similar situations what are some ways youve helped heal your inner child
i could never punch a year old i could never call one stupid i could never cause the harm trauma and abuse you did years old now you told me id understand when i was older i still dont
no everything wasnt ok at home my attendance at school started getting bad teachers noticed i was acting sadly at school even tho i tried not to counselor noticed i was struggling with depression the pediatrician noticed my mom denied it all denied anything was wrong i was beaten punished for telling the counselor the truth i have no where to write this stuff i have a therapist but its not the same as writing its not the same way of getting things out i am now years old and behind in life possibly because all this its really tucked with my head ive got this kick ass bf i dont want to lose i hope my past doesnt ruin my future why though why is it so hard to say i was done wrong and why do i have to feel guilty for it
mom do you want dhr to take you away me only allowed to silently think inside my head silently said to myselfwhy yes yes i do
the abuse has been more emotional for a while more manipulating and my parents playing the victim it usually happens during arguments which i have so much trouble with ive been told stand up for yourself dont let them manipulate you but standing up for myself only leads to more trouble my mom usually asks how are my actions badhow do they effect you sarcastically and it frustrates me so much because shes only going to deny that she did any of itthat it hurt me in any way which yeah because you know exactly what hurts me and what doesnt how are you gonna treat someone bad and then act oblivious to what you did anyways im not sure if i should stand up for myself and make a billionth attempt to express how mentally damaging this all is for me or just do what im doing now let them yell at me while just silently standing there it just seems like theres no point they never listen but stand up for yourself is the only advice i ever get
i need someone to talk to
hear me out i love this woman but i cant stand her anymore i love her for all the sacrifices she has made for me i love her for paying for my education even when it wasnt easy for her i appreciate every single thing she has done for me to get me to where i am today what i dont understand is why she thinks its okay for her to remind me of all she has done every time she does something wrong and i call her out for it i had a very shitty childhood her and my dad got divorced got back together and then got divorced again every time i have an argument with her she blames the divorce on me even though i had nothing to do with it im right now i have developed severe social anxiety and often times i sink deep into really depressive thoughts because her and my dad dragged me into their fights ever since i was or something i saw everything and i mean everything things you shouldnt show a child even on a screen they made me watch it that shit traumatized me i sometimes even had panic attacks cause i worried about them fighting so much that it made me feel sick ofcourse it wouldve had some sort of lasting impact on me its only natural but now she calls me names for just simply being upset over something shell say things like she cant enjoy anything herself so she wants to ruin it for others too look at her its impossible for her to be happy they ruined annual holidays for me cause the only memories i have from those holidays are of them fighting and screaming while the rest of my family celebrated downstairs but i was forced to sit and watch no shit im depressed now but im doing everything i can i work a job i hate so i can help her with bills but she doesnt see any of my efforts idk why she does this to me its so exhausting im sick of forgiving her over and over and over i have tried every recipe in the book i have tried talking to her in all manners possible its impossible for my words to reach her no matter how many times i say them she knows exactly what to say to me to hurt me such as telling me that i ended up just like my father i know its not black and white and shes not a bad person but this one aspect of her is killing me every day and idk how much longer i can hold on i have never cared about what people say but when something like this comes from your own mother it hits different she should be the one to understand why i turned out the way i did better than anyone the worst part is everytime something like this happened everytime she fought with my father my brother ran away and only came back when things calmed down he always avoided everything while i was forced to make sure nothing escalated naturally he turned out confident social and mixes well with people while im the opposite which again is something i get blamed for by my mother a few days ago she told me how shes so glad that my brother didnt end up being damaged goods like his sister that shes so glad she protected him as if i wasnt worth protecting when i asked her this she said well its just your luck that you were born first and a girl its different for girls idk anymore i really dont i feel like theres no point in anything no point in trying no point in holding on i just want to kill myself so i dont have to deal with her words anymore its not just her my dad has a cycle of abuse as well but theres only so much info i can fit into one post so for now ill leave it i cant afford therapy right now and i dont have any friends who i can talk to or any other figure in my life this is why im posting this here im sure many of the things people might suggest are things ive already done but i just wanted to let this out in the world
i f high masking asd have a mother f who constantly verbally and emotionally abused my father f silencing him talking under his hearing level he is mostly deaf and basically everyone was treading on eggshells my entire childhood she also had a repetitive dialogue about the burden of men that they never helpful and are useless and stupid this affected my brother a lot i clashed with her in my teens but am aware that i before and after adolescence have learned to people please keep the peace and try to be liked by everyone so i have social currency to change the atmosphere now in my own relationships i see the same behaviours and temper come out in me i feel rage resentment loneliness and despair in my current relationship hes a great guy m ive never been in love like this and he is almost too patient but he doesnt work hes insecure and a little immature and after months of great mutual support i started to find myself belittling him being quick to anger snapping not wanting to be touchedintimate and feeling frustrated its now a year in its been getting worse and yesterday i asked him if he was falling out of love with me and he said he was scared of me that shame really hit me hard ive been pretty shut down since suicidal thoughts at the forefront hes walking on eggshells and it broke me my previous pattern and strong urge now is to break up with him to stop exposing evil self to people and accept i cant in good conscience let anyone get close to me ive had a good amount of therapy but im still not healed im still repeating my mothers behaviour and i guess im hear to ask if theres hope for me or should i just give up on relationships altogether has anyone else had this experience is there hope for me to manage this should i just leave to spare him
im years old and im supposed to have graduated college but the thing is i was burnt out from high school and i kept failing all my exams so i dropped out and so my parents sent me to therapy and put me on medication but the thing is the medication doesnt fucking work if im stuck with them reminding me that im a failure for not graduating on time and that im the disappointment for being mentally ill and they never let me choose anything and they never accommodate my needs is it really worth it to go on living like this or is there any hope at all
it has been years since ive lived with him full time and over a year since ive lived in a different city im now but the way my adoptive dad who i will b calling my step dad cuz i am uncomfortable calling him dad has treated me in my teenage years still haunts me and causes me to be very short tempered with him and has given me very unhealthy reactions to things my biggest problem is he doesnt think he has ever done anything wrong enough to constitute an apology i talked to him a little over a year ago and i said i was waiting for him to apologize for how he treated me when i was and he basically said he has nothing to be sorry for and while he has changed a lot in the last few years i dont rlly believe the progress has been enough to warrant me changing my views on him for context he was raised super religiousstrict and is a bit of an unspoken alcoholic and i was super addicted to weed and partied a fair amount in my teen years and i was angry after he divorced my mom when i was our relationship entirely changed mostly because i saw how horrible verbally abusive and controlling he was to my mom and becuase i was a little shit i definetly put up challenges and argued and was angry for reasons that were not my own but the way his anger towards grew until i couldnt say a single thing without him assuming i meant it in a way to hurt and offend him i remember so many instances where an offhand comment from me turned into him yelling and waving his hands above his head with me just trying not to react and as i got older it just got worse to hitting the walls or the steering wheel driving eraticly out of anger full on screaming like an animal sometimes dropping to his knees and hitting his head not hard enough to cause injury i think and once throwing a chair across the room all over arguments i dont even remember the subject off and now he expects me to be a responsible grown up and respect him as if i dont start to sweat the moment anyone i love raises the voice or changed their tone my mother was horribly abused as a child and sees my step dads actions as bad and immoral and unfair but not abusive and continues to encourage me to see him and mend a relationship but i dont think i can do it anymore i went to see him fathers day becuase i was in town and it was the same shit acting like i have no right to my own opinion lying to get his way about small things i am tired of this but i also feel so much pity for this man with no one left other then my little sister his blood daughter and they get along wonderfully which is definitely another confusing point for me basically i want to know if you think i have a right to feel this way if this sounds like abuse because its not like i didnt get harsh and bitter towards the end but i was a teenager probably on some drugs most of the time and he was a grown man i am just so unsure how to go forward i have tried demanding apologies but all i get is the same scoff and eye rolling and im tired of it but i dont want to call him abusive over things that happened years ago
its always my fault nothing i do is right according to my family me being bullied my fault me being depressed and in a dark place probably because i didnt do enough work me being sexually assaulted as a toddler i probably encouraged the adult who did it me losing all my stuff my dog my money by my super abusive mother i was clearly to privileged in my shitty apartment i cant even afford no mater what i do it always seems to be right for them im always a disappointment to my family but i dont have anyone else to turn to every one has abandoned me i have nothing in life anymore my parents took everything i have no hope anymore
ive posted about this a lot across various different subreddits but i wanna go into more of the specifics in case anybody has any advice that could be helpful for me i wont go into my moms abusive specifically or at least ill try not too but living here is horrible she actively tries to sabotage friendships my relationship jobs ways for me to leave and more in probably not mentioning i feel like im on the verge of a panic attack whenever im in the same room as her my mom noticing my fear will cause me to be yelled at ive been looking desperately for any possible ways for me to escape this place or for any way for me to secure housing if i get kicked out and i really dont have many options i dont have the grades or money for college i dont have a drivers license i dont have a car all of my devices except for this backup phone were taken away i dont have any family or friends i can live with when i leave and we live in a very bad area in terms of rentjob opportunities cheap shitty apartments are around a thousand and i found one studio thats around bucks but its in a very car dependent area so that probably wont work im at a fucking loss i barely understand what taxes are and how to do them and im generally just not prepared for adult life but i cannot live her any longer i just fucking cant life is so scary and horrifying with my mom around and if she finds out about this phone im fucked after hours of using ai to calculate prices budgets and other things that i understand very little of as well as obsessively researching different towns and states to see where had decent rent prices i actually found something promising theres a town in my state thats not only very walkable but also has somewhat decent rent prices so honestly my current plan is to just try to find a way to get there and then find a cheap studio to live in problem is i dont have a car and i dont even have a months worth of rent saved and my mom probably wont allow me to get a job she fucking loathes me but is also terrified of me abandoning her not to stigmatize cluster b stuff as the spooky abuser disorder ooooooooh but im absolutely convinced she has borderline and narcissism im planning to ask any classmates i can if theyre looking for a temporary roommate when my senior year rolls around in a few months but ill probably be fresh out of luck im autistic and socializing is very hard for me as well as that due to somebody there sharing extremely personal information about me out of spite a lot of people know about my old self harm habits as well as other deeply uncomfortable things theyre kind of the ringleader of the lgbtgroup at my school and because of that im constantly misgendered and dead named even by other fellow trans people it feels so fucking awful and basically no groups at my school will accept me due to us living in a very right wing area ive considered just asking online on transautistic communities if anybody nearby is in need of a roommate but first of all safety lol and secondly i dont really know how most of these communities would probably remove my messages or outright ban me out of fear of me being a predator and i doubt somebody who would be looking for a roommate would settle for somebody who would have to be driven everywhere as well as someone who probably wouldnt be able to pay rent for at least a month so they can jobhunt every day that passes the risk of homelessness just gets scarier and scarier i try to sound cool and composed while typing out a lot of these messages but im really fucking scared if anybody has any advice or any other communities that i could probably reach out to please dont hesitate thanks for reading

hello im currently and ive sort of come to the realization that my parents are not behaving like how my friends parents act towards them and with each so please tell me if theres something wrong with me or with my parents ok so ill start of by saying that my parents never and i mean never got along honestly my sister asked them to get divorced but they refused because of how society may view them if that happens so due to this whenever my parents even sit together they fight their so sick of each other that they dont even wanna look at each other faces me and my siblings tried our best to maybe mend their relationship or make them atleast friends or stand each other for our family sake but they hold grudges against each other and they dont wants to forgive each other my dad in the past would go out for weeks and not return home whenever he fought with mom all i remember is me calling him messaging him and even recording videos and sending it to him begging him to come back he always did because he loved us but he hated my mom he would trow food down on the floor and trow all of her stuff out of their room etc my mom would never react to that and simply go somewhere else which was good so their fights never got bad to the point of my dad physically hurting her my mom tried her best by always trying to make dad happy to the point where she stopped paying any attention to us she was also working but then something rightfully snapped in her and she stopped trying to please him and rightfully fight back i always felt like i was walking on thin ice whenever i talked about dad around her my dad moved to the upper side of the house but he was still living in the same house as mom at this point and even when i tried to talk to her about a different subject she would always round it back and say your dad did this or that she would basically trama dump on us kids i love my mom but honestly i was a kid i didnt want to see my dad in a bad light i know he didnt love mom but he loved us so for our sake he tried to be more nicer to mom and change his way like leaving for weeks etc honestly he still hasent changed much but hes trying but at this point in time it was to late and my mom didint forgive him so my dad gave up as well and now both of them live in the same house pretending as if eachother dont exist so this is the back story for my parents and the possible reason they might be abusive but their behavior towards us is what i want u guys to evaluate for example my mom hitting and shoving us and screaming at us if we get in a argument with her and my dad is always saying to our relatives how toxic our house is which annoys my mom even more and he knows it also he keeps saying we are ungrateful and we dont love him etc etc when hes the one paying the bills and he also used to trow stuff like food my mom made near us and would vanish for weeks my mom keeps bringing and blaming my dad for everything whenever we argue with her like your dad didnt raise you right thats why your this way etc
my mom literally has control over my life she can see and use my phone through her phone she has been deleting everything my emails pictures even got into my discord she has changed my passwords even medical and is in total control since i cant talk to anyone someone pls help

hi i am a year old male living in australia for the past years or so my father who i live with has been emotionally abusive it started in when he blamed my mother for screwing up in raising us and threatened to take us all away and make us live with him he was living in another state for work from that point on he became an incredibly volatile individual and at one point he threatened to throw a key at my mothers face because she told him that he was being reckless when pressuring us to cross the road in dangerous traffic he apologised the following day but he still continued to be threatening at times and one time physically threatened my sister because she was too obsessed with her phone just a week or so ago he unleashed a barrage of verbal abuse at my brother who struggles with depression saying that hes pretty much worthless has no job and saying that when he looks at his brother he is reminded of his failure as a father he also shamed my brother for quitting his medical course and flying back to australia which my brother did because he had ptsd from contracting covid and almost dying in poland ive battled with depression for numerous years and its now reached a point where i feel absolutely suicidal i want to get as far away as possible from my father but i live with him and have no means of financially supporting myself i also dont want to abandon the rest of my family including my brother at such a tough time i am also fearing retaliation from my father but i simply feel i can no longer do this
hello this is my first time actually being able to reach out for help about this i am years old and my brother is and were pretty much being held hostage by our foster mom we originally got placed with her in because my siblings and i were physically and mentally abused for years and even starved as punishment at our past home with my aunt and her boyfriend i was also molested and raped by my aunts boyfriend and a dew of his male and female friends multiple times we are genuinely thankful for everything our foster mom has done for us without a doubt but she is crazy manipulative and a narcissist i know it sounds weird when i mention our ages any normal person would think dude youre just leave bro but its really not that simple she holds every single possible advantage over us she has our birth certificates and refuses to give them to us and we have no clue where she has them we recently graduated high school this past month and shes actively avoiding going and getting it because she knows no matter what we cant go we dont have jobs vehicles money or any way to get there whatsoever we have no other family we have no friends we have no one but her all she cares about is cleaning and thats it it seems that she wants us to stay here only to clean i believe shes also scared of being lonely because she cheated on her girlfriend and she left her girlfriend was im our lives since and was pretty much a second mother to us she was the balance that this household needed and she left back in february and its been living hell since my stepmother doesnt care about anything but cleaning she has no care for our physical or mental well being im not asking to be catered to like a baby but at least give us our basic needs her only focus is cleaning her entire mood for the rest of the day depends on how good the house was cleaned from top to bottom and note we have dogs that are barely trained no one wanted these dogs but her and she doesnt want to take care of them so were forced to also her soon who is years old also lives here and we are pretty much his servants he doesnt have to do anything not even things for himself im surprised he can wipe his own ass thats just how its always been with him when we first moved here we were told he doesnt have any chores because i want him to be a kid for a little bit longer he was around at the time and we were all under cleaning the house top to bottom every single day cleaning has shifted from a common chore to our life amd it seems thats the way she wants it and if its not done to her standard she has extreme ocd she will spit threats at us left and right she threatens to kick us to the curb and she mentions about how she wishes she never brought us here and that we dont work and that were lazy because we dont work mind she wont let us she refuses any sort of conversation about us getting jobs it has turned to full blown arguments because of how bad she doesnt want us to work she acts the way she does because she knows for a fact that if my dad was still around he wouldnt allow it he passed in after being in the hospital paralyzed from the waist down since he did everything he possibly could for us genuinely a great man and we miss him so much that it hurts she also blames us for his death she has said to us countless times that its our fault alo our mother isnt really in the picture she surrendered us to our aunt back in because she simple could not afford to support us because she had just lost her job and the house we were living in was too expensive for her because she work at walmart as a cake decorator or something like that she did everything we could and i applaud her for that because i cant even imagine how hard that mustve been so we are stuck with our stepmom unfortunately ive been pretty much begging her to help us get our social security cards and high school diplomas so we can get jobs and be able to support ourselves but she is doing everything in her power to make it not happen we have nothing we have no one and she knows that and takes advantage of it we feel like we have no way out so much to the point to where we have discussed suicide together me and my brother im just so sick and tired of living in constant fear of losing everything because of this crazy woman and it hurts even more seeing the complete void of sadness in my brothers eyes no one deserves this not even my worst enemy we are at our breaking points and we cant take this much longer theres so many more things i can mention but i feel like just rambling at this point so if anyone is reading this please im begging you help us in any way possible im not asking for a pity party or money but any sort of way that we can leave this place in one piece it will be extremely appreciated because we feel like we have no escape so this is our final resort

sorta nsfw barely graffiti mentioned my mothers celebration of life i had it put together for her siblings was held in a pavilion at a park last weekend shed died in february and was cremated so we set up the memorial on a table by the wall of the pavilion with picture boards her degrees and diplomas yadda yadda a while later i noticed there was some graffiti id missed when setting it up a giant dick drawn in black on a dark brown surface kinda hard to see hairy balls and all it was absolutely the perfect scenario any pictures of her memorial will have that in it whoever the immature jackass happens to be i love you for it
i finally stood up to my mother after about years of dealing with her abusive shit i wont go into specifics but shes an awful mother but according to her ive rewritten the narrative and im the awful one i think ill be disowned from my family for finally standing my ground but i couldnt take the constant micro aggressions and the love bombing and the manipulation its funny because she said shed always love and accept me for who i am but she has never done that once and now i think ive gone too far but she has hated who ive become and who i love i had to say something because i knew i couldnt live with myself if i tried to keep the peace forever it really hurts because my dad and my brother are innocent and have been abused by her too i really dont think i can repair the damage i caused and honestly im a little relived ive finally been disowned while im not proud of my outburst she needed to be put in her place maybe shell finally examine how she hurts and manipulates everyone around her
my parents are extremely dirty and filthy people and they are major hoarders ive spent all my life trying to clean up their messes they leave all their crap everything many rooms are filled to the brim with their crap ive fought with them so many times telling them to get rid of their shit or just put it away but they dont give a fuck ive even tried to speak to them calmly about how their mess affects me mentally but they still do not change there is no routine cleaning of any areas of the house to protect my mental sanity i just hole up in my room and rarely come downstairs or interact with them they only ever clear stuff up when guests come and they demand that i clean up with them it frustrates me so much because there have been many time where i will make the house look spotless but they will bring their shit and crap all over the house again and its a mess once more nothing can be maintained they are so so comfortable living in a filthy environment because of this i have stopped cleaning the house because if they cannot respect themselves and our family enough to keep it clean then why should i i dont have to share any spaces with them i am fine staying in my room we are middle class and my parents constantly bring home dozens of items from food pantries and we literally have no use or space for these items they will literally eat moldy food and just scoop out the moldy part and eat the rest of the moldy food they leave open food out everywhere we have had several cockroach and mice infestations and ive had to beg and scream for us to get pest control treatments they refuse to continue because they think its no major deal having vermin our drawers and cabinets in the kitchen and living room are constantly filled with mice poop once we had a whole bag of rice that was torn apart by mice and it was filled with mice poop my parents proceeded to handpick the mouse poop out wash the rice several times cook it and serve it to us i was in absolute shock last week i saw a mouse in our dish rack who knows where these mice get into they could be crawling over our clean dishes i resort to my bed room and buy and eat packaged food or take out i despise them and their filth and refuse to help them clean when guests come over and they will try to emotionally abuse me and even try to hit me if i dont help them my mom claims that even if there is crap everywhere that i should still vacuum dust and sweep i dont even spend any time downstairs so i dont even feel obligated to clean there if they do not respect their children to keep the house clean for them then why should i clean up for their guests plus it feels pointless to me because vacuuming the floor isnt suddenly going to make the room look spotless i can clean the fridge but i cant throw away any old food i can wipe down all surfaces but there are still doing to be random condiments bottles and crap all over the countertops so what is the point am i in the wrong is my response valid i have currently locked myself into my bedroom because my dad was being physically aggressive and violent who the fuck would want to clean your dirty fucking house when you try to intimidate them into doing it
is it possible that when a narcissistic parents doesnt like their children they want them to die i actually feel with confidence that my own father want me to die with starvation hes a mamas boy and he also doesnt have a good childhood but idk what her mother did because they were just in luck of fortune when it comes to money her mother is good at spells and lucks but im not really closed to her about my dad he has a lot of money he could afford therapy for me if he would but he wont do it because he said he doesnt want to go to jail which is absolutely the most absurd thing ive ever heard and so he actually admitted that hes neglecting me i got distanced to him and he got distanced to me even more eventually he doesnt really talk about something emotional hed end the phone call and tell me hes doing something and hed call me later as an excuse this is so hard to open up with people because even my own family moms side treats me like a black sheep because i chose to do the emotional work idk about my fathers side im young only i feel like my dad just wants me to be depressed and kill myself ps u dont have to read this just some details idk what hes doing he has cars he lives in usa and he says hes gonna take me to us and live with him im currently on another country with my moms theyre divorce when i was and about that ive been waitibg for years to approve my visa and now im but he said it was not approved yet he showed me when i was on a video call theres a room for me when ill live with him maybe one thing that hesitated him is he knows i prefer to do the emotional work and one thing that my dad hate is emotions bc what couldve been happen in years
i am a yr old girl who is in a relationship and is planning to pursue psychology for my bachelors next year tell me why my parents care so much about what i pursue solely because of their reputation i am being forced to take mbbs medicaldoctor even tho i dont want to because they want me to and i am also being forced to break up with my boyfriend and have also been through numerous situations of physical and verbal abuse for the both of them after a certain point in life i feel like its a bit too much when your parents try to control things that dont bother them like if u want me to do something so tedious and suicidal as medical then you shouldve done it yourself and not just force me to do something i dont want to do abusive parents may not realize it but when theyre giving birth to a child its not just a child its a whole person the person does not have to think like you act like you or live like you its so ridiculous at this point and it pisses me off really bad
my mother wrongfully hit me when i was young and when she got tired she left and then she came back refreshed and continued to beat me nothing i said could make her stop its decades later but every single time i think of her hitting me which is every time i think of her i begin to feel a deep anger i do not like the feeling its poisonous to my soul i read the body keeps the score and learnt about the ace adverse childhood experiences test and dont want to die from a stroke in my s or be found alone at home because of something i had no control over when i was a kid
its almost illegal for me to laugh and smile or do anything fun its either stay at home or go to school or study for me i dont have any friends or nothing thanks mom and dad for the terrible social skills and i havent gone out shopping or anything in so long i have such bad anxiety i fuck up my studying as well which doesnt sit right with my asian parents i dont look very good as well so its kinda like i am failing in every aspect of life like i have bad grades bad parents a terrible future no friends and i look terrible as well really there is nothing going on for me and all i do is take my medications and get my daily dose of serotonin from them
my family has been in a cult my whole life ive finally stood up for myself and now i have two weeks to get out i need to finish paying for car things and then im free my job wont give me hours doordash isnt working and i cant borrow from anyone because no one who still likes me has money idk what to do im so close to freedom but also so close to giving up at this point i will do pretty much anything
please do not say if you think hitting kids is okay then you did not turn out right that is a circular argument or a tautological one we are establishing whether the claim hitting kids is okay for discipline is okay so we cant use that assumption that it is not in the argument sorry but if we resort to tautological arguments we are no better than people who say because i did so

hello i am female here i have struggled horribly with my mental health from the abuse ive faced as a child and teenager i dont even remember some of my childhood because it was so bad but these are just some that i remember they have done so many things to me and i am just so sick and tired of it when i was a kid my mom beat me for not drinking a glass of water and dumped it on my head i was when i was a kid i used her bangle to trace a circle and i took a nap so naturally i forgot where i put it she beat me and put all my toys in the trash thinking that i was lying and hiding it somewhere i was when i was a kid she would hit me a lot for simple things like not getting dressed fast when i was a kid she hit me and screamed at me for changing my barbie dolls outfit claiming that i am a pervert and i was creepy i was when i was a kid my mom asked me for the scissors she was laying on the sofa so i put it flat on her chest since she was laying down not pointing towards her or anything she turned to me started screaming hysterically and crying that i tried to kill her and beat me i was when i was a kid she would constantly say i have no respect for her because i didnt say mommy at the end of each sentence she would beat me and scream at me i was when my younger sister was born i took a lot of care of her and i was they just let me do everything for her i fell behind on my homework because of that and i got beat when i wanted to hang out with my friend who was a different religion from me they would scream at me and say horrible things about her and not let me see her eventually i was not able to see any of my friends and i could not even ask for permission to leave the house i became so lonely i was they would get mad when i wore pants in the house and strictly wanted me to wear underwear in the house when i did wear them i would get my butt slapped or squeezed by both parents this went on until i was years old all of a sudden they wanted me to cover up once i turned and even wearing skinny jeans was horrible when i wore skinny jeans around the ages since everyone in my school was wearing it and i didnt want to be made fun of my dad accused me of trying to show off my body to everyone and screamed that i am losing my self respect i was an underdeveloped child i got my period when i just turned i was not allowed to have sex ed my parents didnt consent so i did not know what a period was they said that what is happening to me is really bad and i cannot tell anyone and i am not allowed to touch animals or plants and i do they will die because of me they did not give me menstrual pads they gave me diapers the ones old people use and convinced me that i had some disease and i was going to die soon they had me do that for a year whenever i got my period in school i felt so uncomfortable putting on a diaper and so afraid someone may see it and make fun of me i did not know periods were a normal thing until i was i asked them about it and their reasoning was i was too young so they were ashamed and thought i could not handle how to use a pad properly i was not allowed to listen to music that was not religious until the age of when my dad saw me listening to music with headphones he screamed at me told me i was listening to vulgar lyrics and i am trying to be an adult so bad by getting into bad content by taylor swift is apparently vulgar when i was i dated my first boyfriend when we broke up i cried and my mom noticed when i lied about it she said she knew it was about a guy so i had to tell her i had a boyfriend she beat me screamed at me threw a bottle of mouthwash at me and threw my instrument i played for school a saxophone against the wall when i was in th grade i switched my career focus path out of computer science to undecided as after one semester i realized i did not enjoy it additionally my parents were the one who wanted me to do computer science i forgot to tell them i switched and my mom saw my courses online after i switched she asked me where computer science was and i told her i switched it and i forgot to tell her that day she went ballistic on me she called me a failure called my whole extended family saying i was going to work in mcdonalds for the rest of my life beat me horribly and then choked me i thought i was going to die that day so i pushed her and then she started crying and screaming to my dad that i hit her then my dad scolded me saying that a child cannot hit the parent but the parent can hit the child my mom said she will stop this argument if i choose to either become a doctor or engineer not knowing what to do i just picked doctor i kept that path in high school for them when i was turning i had wanted to wear a dress to school for my birthday she said my dress was too short even though it was above the knees and i said it wasnt and she said that i wont understand and i should get raped so i actually understand a few weeks after that i got sexually assaulted in a hoodie and sweatpants we went on vacation and randomly my father started ignoring me and being misognystic towards me and i started crying and told him to please not say that and women and men are equal he said that i am worth a and he doesnt care ever and over again as i was bawling in his face i was i told my father i felt sexually harassed by my school coach he said that he coach probably sees me as a grandchild and i need to stop assuming bad things about men the coach pressed his front to my back while i was trapped and could not away in the pandemic my grades dropped and i was very suicidal instead of supporting me they told my sister to not talk to me until my grades went up i was already incredibly lonely i had a mandatory therapist from my school as my school found out about how suicidal i was i had to do a mental health screening with my pediatrician and my result was really bad my mom talked about how i cut myself just because i got yelled at over simple things the doctor reprimanded at her that she needs to actually support me as a mother and i am clearly struggling she said i had to see a therapist sooner when we got in the car i asked her if i was getting a therapist she told me to shut up and there is nothing wrong with me and i lied to the pediatrician i was really suicidal when i was and instead of getting me help my dad dragged me on the floor with my hair beat me until i was a ball on the floor and video called relatives showing me crying that i wanted to die i started developing a bigger chest when i was i was only allowed to wear baggy clothes then and i had to dress masculine my dad would compliment me saying i actually looked respectable i enjoy dressing ultra feminine soft and coquette fashion i hated myself so much for the way i looked whenever i showed any bit of my figure or my chest looked big both my mother and father would slut shame me and say i was losing respect for myself i was and i never had any self esteem because i felt so ugly wearing masculine clothes and not being able to show even a little bit of my figure which i had grown to like i gained weight due to depression and my family both body shamed me instead of encouraging me to work out or be healthier when i started going to college i stopped answering their calls often i had to live with them during holidays though after my first year i realized i did not want to do stem and pursue the medical field i was screamed at horribly by my mother saying what will happen to our family reputation if i end up a failure doing a simple job after coming all the way to america i ended up choosing a field i genuinely liked after months of thinking but still makes good pay but not stemmed related i wish they told me theres other opportunities outside of those things to make a good living my sister was failing out of middle school and she did not get any consequences from it instead they just made me do her homework for her when i had my own college assignments to do recently i have told them that i have a boyfriend and i have been going out with him he makes me so happy and actually unconditionally loved i told my mom and at first she sounded accepting i felt hopeful that my relationship with her will actually be repaired as weeks progressed she started being really aggressive and started indirectly slut shaming me saying i have no dignity theres no need for me to see my boyfriend and i should focus on school my father is completely ignoring my existence for the last few weeks after months of therapy trying to forgive them for all the abuse they caused me in my childhood and teenage years now i am not being allowed to go out with anyone but im going to break that rule this is my last straw after realizing that i can actually be unconditionally loved appreciated and cared for i just want to leave i dont care if its a dumb idea i just want to go no contact with them immediately because i cannot stand being treated so sub humanely anymore i am tired of being controlled i called the suicide hotline times this week because it hurt so much and while i was talking to them something in me just snapped i am just done with this treatment i am so so done i want to leave i cannot live more years like this if theres any way i can get help financially to move out please let me know any tips for this is

yearold male here my parents are generally loving and caring folks who have gone above and beyond and sacrificed a lot to secure a better life for me and my little siblings like all parents though they have their flaws some of which i deem as abusive but which they vehemently deny so reddit based of this list are my parents abusive or not my experiences woken up in the middle of the night by mum and had the living shit beaten out of me in bed after she went through my phone which i let her borrow because hers wasnt working and saw me exchanging mild terrorist jokes with my friend on whatsapp belted several times by both my folks such as for talking to two strangers about my personal life due to stranger danger when i was about or getting into arguments with my siblings smacked in the head by both my folks multiple times such as for accidentally miswriting something on a homework report or being unable to tell the time in my preteens pinched multiple times by both my folks for various misdeeds such as not wanting to take my shirt off during a family outdoor activity in the spring or innocently behaving inappropriately as a kid had a small chair smashed over my head by dad for getting into an argument with my sister for various other misdeeds ive been kicked violently shaken like a rag doll beaten with a wooden spoon had something thrown at me forced to kneel on the floor and raise my arms up in the air until told otherwise made to stay outside the house in the wind wearing a shirt and shorts and i dont remember who said it exactly but i think i recall one of my folks threatening that they might not be able to control themselves if theyre sufficiently pissed off ive been threatened with bodily harm countless times ive received several death threats even if they werent serious if i showed a hint of resistance towards mums physical discipline by reflexively protecting myself shed guilttrip me by saying so the son strikes back eh even though i would never and was nowhere to retaliating on mum only shielding myself even at age when i confronted her about her physical discipline she defended herself by claiming that i only focused on the negatives and never the positives of their parenting and she doesnt regret anything she ever did to me and that even if i was aged she would still dole out the physical punishment if she wanted to when i said i wont let her touch me she once again asked me if this meant i was going to start beating her back i said id never lay a hand on her nor had i even thought of doing so its just that i wouldnt let her touch me thats it she asked what if she were to throw a shoe at me would i throw the shoe back at her and i said no id just keep a distance from her and she lost all control and started berating me for being an ungrateful son etc before abruptly changing her tune and claiming she was only joking one time mum was continually interrupting my conversation with dad over the phone causing me to tell her in frustration that im trying to talk on the phone but which she misinterpreted as me telling her to shup up or something resulting in her immediately getting physical with me had dad being angry and yelling at me to stop crying during shower time as he doused me with cold water which i absolutely hated but the hot water wasnt working when i was about after we actually enjoyed a sweaty game of football with some local kids which soured the experience for me and made me reluctant to play football outside again since the only way i could play was if i had either of my folks with me one summer vacation we were at the beach in the sea and dad was trying to take me to the deeper levels despite me being very uncomfortable as i couldnt swim properly yet resulting in me almost drowning when he left me to it but mum saved me another time mum was continuously making fun of something i wrote in a book causing me to smack the book out of her hand in anger which she beated me for and locked me up in my room in my later teens dad would frequently get me to help him out in incredibly strenuous activities which would often completely physically drain me both when we were refurbishing our house and building our upandcoming shop to the point where the neighbouring shopkeepers who saw how tirelessly i worked for him expressed concern by telling him to go a bit easy on me and at least pay me for my efforts which he addressed by asking me dont they know youre my son i never once complained or declined his requests to help out since i knew we were tight on money and dad was making use of all the free help he could get my only issues were some instances of potential abuse such as when he got angry and started yelling at me to perform a task that i genuinely didnt understand how to do i remember pleading with him to help me understand but he continued to get frustrated and scaring the shit out of me or this other time where after a hard days work at building our shop i didnt immediately acknowledge something dad said to me leading him to berate me for my supposed social blunder when he just wouldnt let up i then proceeded to remind him of a social blunder he once committed causing him to punch me in the face and berate me more until we got home when we arrived home i was offered dinner which i declined solely because i was uncomfortable being around him and so wanted to immediately go to bed but he forced me to sit right next to me and eat while he shot a death glare at me which i interpreted as him asserting his dominance over me dad could be very shorttempered and erratic on occasion to the point where i would feel like i was walking on eggshells around him at times such as when i woke up one morning and greeted him with a casual hellooo that had a bit of a drawl to it and he suddenly froze up and looked at me with a death glare and i quickly apologised scolding me for laying my heavy head back on the sofa while he spoke to me scolding us if me or my siblings said excuse me if he was in our way in the house since apparently that was too formal and not something youd say to a family member especially a father or if we forgot to say good morning to him after waking up ive actually had to appeal to mum to ask him to control his temper on a couple of occasions and as a result i feel like i can never truly relax around him on multiple occasions ive been forced to eat something even if i didnt want to they were pretty strict restrictive and judgmental folks and could be overbearing mum would never let me visit another schoolmates house without them having visited ours first as she explicitly explained so herself and even that was a moot point because she didnt want any peer of mine coming over anyway so none of my peers came over to my house until i was and that was only because i showed up home with him unexpected and practically begged her to let him come in and id never been to any of my peers house apart from this one guys house and that was without her knowledge or consent she forbade all social media apart from whatsapp and even that i always used in secret when texting people since i knew shed find some way to be judgmental about it she wouldnt let me go play football with my friends if she didnt drive me over there herself so she would know the location and even that was reluctantly expressed so i almost never played with them outside of school anyway throughout our teens she forbade tv on the weekdays save for friday which she would brag about to her friends and very rarely let me hang out with others after school for a social outing discounting the after school badminton club on thursdays in my mid teens which took place at school though i guess this could once again be chalked up to being moneyconscious but also being overly distrustful of everyone in the uk dad could also get like this such as making us do school work on friday after school or insisting on cutting my fingernails even as he was making me bleed they both generally either discouraged or outright forbade my interest in certain things particularly fantasy which included things like mum eventually forbidding me from reading harry potter berating and almost getting physical with me for watching a bond film with my siblings when i was about and just when i thought she couldnt possibly find an angle to criticise on me watching my little pony she reproached me for a kiss scene that took place this trait of theirs got completely overblown after my little brothers nervous breakdown causing dad to completely ban our former interests in comic books and naruto reprimand me for watching going on due to its fantastical elements and disapprove of us playing fifa to the point where i genuinely felt like i couldnt enjoy anything when around them they would also criticise us a lot for relatively minor things and their lectures could be excruciatingly long spanning hours they also had next to no concept of privacy entering our rooms without ever knocking unless they knew we were changing and confiscating our phones a couple times for no real reason whatsoever all this has led to me being incredibly sneaky about what i do i never let them see me with my phone only ever using it out of their eyesight and i routinely deleted shit stored up on it in case they randomly needed my phone which they would i also became adept at lying as well as identifying footsteps i think due to the sort of parenting they employed i was very anxious and scared during these particular events my primary school teacher once lent me her harry potter dvd box set and i didnt even get past the first film from great fear that mum would catch me watching it and get angry during one summer vacation back to our homeland the plan was that dad would remain in the uk for a bit while the rest of us would go to our country before he joined us i knew that harry potter would be running on some of the tv channels in the uk and throughout the portion of the summer holiday where dad was still in the uk which was several weeks i was deathly afraid of him watching the films and finding out that this was what i liked i had a bedwetting problem for most of my life one time when i was about dad woke me up in the middle of the night to discover that id once again wet the bed he angrily told me to get up told me to face the wall and remain in that position in my pissstained clothes as punishment while he changed my bed and made me go back to bed again after hed changed my clothes i have noticeable bumps on my foreheads which i remember where obtained from hitting my head on the ground as a toddler but which mum claims are just natural or something which i interpret as gaslighting mum accused dad of cheating on her but he proved he wasnt years later when i enquired as to what their fight was about she told me the truth that it was a misunderstanding over his fidelity which i suspected was the case back then when i brought it up again later however she totally lied about it for some reason which i again see as gaslighting when mum caught me watching porn for the first time ever at age she berated me by asking whether this also means i would like to see her or my sister naked during some of our more heated arguments mum has claimed that i wouldnt care that she died several times despite me having been an incredibly devoted and loving child towards her during my preteens and early teens when i was a kid i told dad i wanted to make cartoons in the future as a career and he said that that job was for a software engineer as an adult i realise now that he was being manipulative i once remember asking mum if she loved me unconditionally which she confirmed when i asked dad he tried to brush it off when i asked him again he got a bit pissy about it so i dropped the topic assuming that his love wasnt unconditional and even though mum has repeatedly told me that she loves me and my sister equally and doesnt play favourites i have found myself struggling to believe it this is because she has nowhere never inflicted the same level of abuse towards sis as me and tends to send her off with only a reprimanded for more egregious misdeeds than me like sis going inside her bedroom without her permission and stealing her makeup or eating some snacks that mum specifically said not to whereas she has repeatedly gotten physical with me for genuine mistakes even though i was a much more wellbehaved and devoted child towards mum than sis ever was especially during my preteens and early teens they both had a tendency to downplay my mental health issues instead advising me to turn myself over to god thing is i no longer believe in god so that advice was falling on deaf ears and i am terrified of coming out to them as an atheist because of their fundamentalist beliefs after deceiving my parents for two years about my online learning while it was justified to an extent dad really let me have it telling me in no uncertain terms every opportunity he had how extremely let down he was how hed never seen anything like this happen anywhere in his entire life he was at this point and how my deception and failure were among the two biggest tragediesdisappointments in his life the other being the civil war raging in our homeland mind you this civil war resulted in the genocide of thousands upon thousands of our ethnic tribe he would also say that hes so angry but he cant beat me to let it out because im an adult now i was at the time so hes forced to stew helplessly in his own anger my little brothers experiences got the living shit beaten out of him by mum after he was tricked by his friends into writing fuck on a whiteboard he didnt even know what it meant but i could hear his pitiful wails and screams coming from the bedroom where mum was beating him he accidentally tripped and broke a stair pillar while we were organising the shoe room once causing mum to lose it and get physical with him when i brought this up with dad years later mum either lied about the events or didnt recall it well the former which i interpret as another round of gaslighting but regardless dad was more inclined to believe her than me during his psychosis when he had trouble eating or drinking mum got physical with him by trying to forcefully make him drink some water along with his med causing it to spill all over his face hes also been pinched and smacked on the head several times for various misdeeds hes also been threatened with bodily harm several times my little sisters experiences when my sister was some of her friends called her from dads phone she asked if she could pick up and he said yes so she did but when he asked her to give him the phone she impulsively hung up dad slapped her hard across the face for it mum hit her because sis was taking too long to get ready to go on a mandatory walk mum got very physical with sis after she found out that sis was getting some remote it person to help out with fixing an issue on a laptop she was working on when sis was dad punched her around the back of her head for going to his and mums room in the morning to look for clothes when she was dad threatened to gouge out her eyes and cut her legs if she wore mascara dad hit her across the face because she sighed during one of his lectures dad told her he wasnt abusive as other parents as they go so far as killing their kids so hes not bad dad punched her around the face for sighing during another lecture even though she never did causing her to cry right before putting on a school performance dad beat her legs with a belt until a flap of skin came off and she bled for minutes because she had a tiny bit of mascara on dad punched her numerous times in the back of her head because she had plucked her brows and forced mums hands behind her back and shoved her onto the bed when she tried to intervene when sis was and late to school as the car was down dad rode her to school on a bike but her leg got caught in the wheel as they were going full speed which almost literally caused her foot to be cut in half she was in so much pain but he wouldnt check the wound until her friends at school insisted she get it checked because she could barely walk dad frequently threatens to beat and throw things at her if angry enough and shes a young adult dad slapped her across the face when she was acting bratty towards him and took her upstairs to slap her up some more dad tried to make sis study almost every day of the summer even though she was already a good student attending grammar school dad got pissy with her for simply reading literature during her study breaks and disallowed her from doing so so reddit are my parents abusive

i f havent been allowed to go to friends houses since elementary school when i went to a private school where my parents could actually know the other parents i had one girl over after she insisted when i was a middle schooler in public school and that went awry she behaved poorly and since then i havent been allowed to have anyone else over period for years i was told no bf till something i obeyed in freshman and sophmore years towards the end of junior year i got a bf that i hid until they eventually found out about i was when they found out previous to meeting this guy i had another very short term bf they also found about and i did dump at their command now keep in mind ive been a very good student for years mostly as only one c in all four years of high school macroeconomics i took ap courses and dc classes and passed them all so in all matters of college its always been made clear by my father that i was to be a lawyer and there was no other choices when i try to tell him about my passion for writing and computer science separately primarily interested in writing its shut down with talks of how im going to be a lawyer then a judge and do what he wants in our city my mother is more lax on that but still insisted i be a lawyer and when talking about it to others or them its easier to talk about what im going to college for a bachelors degree for so she took that as me not going to do it and ditching it for my bf who is two grades below me though hes they badger me about this any time the topic is brought up and it significantly raises my anxiety previous to having my bf i was in a deep depression and they somehow didnt notice he helped put me back together the only times we could hang out though was in a club after school so we did that and my father said i could walk to the local gas station with friends from the club so i went with them sometimes or i went with the bf and wed stay out a bit longer just hanging out on school property when my parents found out they pulled me from every one of my clubs and they had recently let me hang out with one friend out of school because they knew his parents well i was no longer allowed to hang out with him either because i might be around bf i am no longer allowed to do pretty much anything that means leaving the house i own a car but im not allowed to go for drives even though they said i would be able to i wasnt allowed to have a job while in high school so i have borderline nothing saved up for school they also are unwilling to pay for my college in any form aside from maybe meal plan saying that they did everything they were going to while i was in high school on top of the issues with college while i was with my bf my father kept threatening violence towards him so i told bf to stay away from my father also my father told me that if he ever was around the kid that he would hurt him badly when i was somewhat allowed to be with bf they constantly would tell me that i was a wet blanket now that theres nothing to me and talk about how i was giving up everything i wasnt in the slightest and insult me frequently they even got my youngest brother to start doing the same as well i cant talk with my bf through text because they might see it and get onto me i have to use apps that i have to delete frequently and my phone gets put up at night so i rely on my computer they said if i ever go to his house theyll call the police and say theres drugs in the house they also talk about how if i go over there ill be raped by the stepfather trafficked that the parents will hurt me in ways that will eventually kill me and that when it happens theyll be on anyones side but mine they detail the ways i would be harmed in the past theyve got me so stressed and anxious that i cant eat i cry myself to sleep then they threaten to take me to the mental hospital for not eating or acting upset in any way i said i might not come home some weekends of college and they took that badly and went back to talking about every possible bad thing that apparently will happen when i go to bfs house i have had to keep my best friend hidden for years now because they dont like his family so i have to talk to him the same way i do with my bf through other chat apps im barely able to tell them about my actual passions because they dont care though they say i never talk to them it got so bad when i was somewhat allowed to be with him that i started making plans to run away then i let it slip in one of our fights that i could just leave and stay with bf since then theyve been threatening violence towards him more than ever and they know the police and sheriff in my town and talk about how no one would ever believe ive been treated bad ever and that i havent ever been treated bad i really dont know what to do im running out of options and all the options i have are bad stay leave bf be miserable and lose the things that make me happy and the main person i can talk to stay stay with him continue life like this and watch everything get taken away leave stay with a friend so they cant find me lose them and my siblings in any situation im miserable but if i leave i just stay in the college dorms and stay with a friend on breaks i hate it here too often and stay in a mild panic thinking that if i can just make it through the day its another day closer to being freeish
aitah for telling my bfs mom to stop mooching off him and get a job ok so this has gone on for years bfs mom well call her karen has refused to try working a day in her life she forces bf yr old to supply everything for her she has put his life in multiple ways yet she plays victim any time he tries to defend himself she has tried yanking the gear shift in the car tried to yank steering wheel pressed false charges on bfs brother having him arrested and now that its just bf and karen in the house she forces him to pay all the bills food everything she claims she filed for disability but doesnt go to doctors doesnt attempt to work from home in any way or anything he tried telling her to stop spending his money and she screams financial abuse and everything i finally snapped im literally dying and still pay my own bills aitah for calling her out for being an abusive lazy pos that needs to get a job and stop being a mooch a leech a bum if you will she is practically a squatter
i feel really bad for hitting her i didnt want to but i couldnt stop myself i hate how she talks to me abuses me then she loves me too she says she will never do it again but she keeps repeating saying and doing this i absolutely hate it and hate myself because i think i dont deserve my parents she does all the work tells me she loves me but she abuses me spits on me but hasnt hit me since one to two years idk what to do i always feel so conflicted today when i heard her say those things i couldnt stop myself from hitting her and then telling her that it wouldve been better if i was not born to her i think im a disappointment i dont understand if im wrong or right i didnt want to hit her idk if its my fault i think it is for upsetting her she says the most vicious things to me i hate how she character assassinates me and tells me she hopes i get r worded
id like to start off by saying im very nervous too call my parents abusers thats a very strong word very negative and it would mean i need a lot more help than i am willing to allow myself to believe as of right now i love my parents i believe they love me but when i was younger the way that i was treated is a haunting memory my mother was the main person that would hit me physically she would give me whoopings for somethings which is in someways normalized but she would also have bouts of angriness about things that i said or did that would make her go absolutely ballistic on me these were usually things that were small but her emotions would be at a boiling point and she would let them spill over physically punching and sometimes kicking me this was mainly when i was younger and had less ability to fight back i am now bigger than my mother so her trying to beat me up would result in her most likely also getting hurt my dad has always come to my rescue at these times afterward he ignores my mom for a week and she blames me and my disrespect which i have said some disrespectful things but nothing to warrant that reaction and then everything goes back to normal my dad also has bouts of angriness they are less common than my mothers and he usually does not hurt me as bad as he works to display that he is stronger than me there is also a lot of gaslighting and manipulation that goes along with this that i cannot get into because who has the time
im going off to job corps in a couple of weeks i told him i could take care of myself then he laughed and said well see i know he expects me to quit the program and come crawling back to him but what if i do what if i cant take care of myself after all im trying not to let him fuck with my confidence but i cant help but have that nagging feeling that maybe hes right
as the title says ive made several other posts about specifically what im gonna do when i leave get kicked out and while i have a few plans for when it does eventually happen the fucking constant stream of negativity is just too much for me to handle a while ago my mom went out of state with my siblings to go visit some family i stayed behind with my stepdad to occasionally clean the house and go to my stepdads office to clean for some extra money and holy shit best days of my life the anxiety was still there but everything just felt so peaceful and mellow i genuinely felt happy if i wanted to get up and just make myself a grilled cheese or a quesadilla simply because i felt like it i could i was able to finish watching breaking bad a show my mom kind of blew up at me for watching because my bio dad was an addict at one point and for some reason she thought i was watching the show to learn how to make meth which uh just what the fuck and i was also just able to nap and relax whenever i felt like it i had chores to do but i could do them at my own pace and considering that im autistic and i have sensory issues just being able to get them done when i feel good about doing them just felt absolutely wonderful i didnt have to worry about getting them done literally as soon as i wake up and i didnt have to worry about her screaming at me and bursting through my door because i put a dish in the wrong cabinet or some shit i could just take my time and do things at my own pace i actually felt more motivated to do housework simply due to the fact that i could do it at my own pace without having to worry about my moms verbal abuse i honestly cant begin to describe how nice it felt those days genuinely some of the best days of my life because i could just take things at my own pace and like be me something im really not able to do around her and then she showed back up from the first fucking moment she arrived we were already having issues according to her i looked scared when i was helping bring in groceries and stuff expressing fear around her is a death sentence and later when she ended up yelling at me over essentially the same thing she made a sarcastic remark about how obviously i seem to be uncomfortable around her and how she doesnt have to live here about a year ago when she kind of forced me to admit i was suicidal she hit me in the face immediately and mocked me i let it slip that i was very uncomfortable around her which is absolutely true shes been using this piece of knowledge against me and she brings it up in order to make me feel ashamed and guilty shes yelled at me a handful of times over me looking afraid and uncomfortable around her shes been here like days and just i am so fucking constantly stressed my chest is tight my mind is racing my entire body just feels horrible because of the anxiety my sensory issues are getting worse and everything just feels so shitty honestly another thing i should mention im using a backup phone right now she doesnt know i own this my regular phone was taken from me because she looked through it and saw me researching cps and online abuse communities this backup phone is basically the only way for me to talk to my ldr partner my mom is convinced the theyre a pedophile trying to sell me into a human trafficking ring and she constantly misgenders and generally dehumanizes them her reasoning for all of this is because she found a message where they were discussing a vpn they used thats literally it and as well as that this phone is my only way to research what im gonna do when i either leave or get kicked out i have a little under dollars at the moment and i have a little less than a year until i turn i dont have a drivers license and my mom got mad at me because of it saying that i need to take initiative and ask her to take me driving so i can prepare to get my license heres the thing i really dont want to fucking talk to her at all whatsoever let alone drive around a parking lot for minutes with her breathing down my neck but at the same time theres really no other way for me to get my license and i dont think theres anyone else who can take me driving my current plan is to just save any money that i get and try to find either a roommate online or a really cheap bedroom apartment which is easier said than done we live in a very republican middle of nowhere area and there arent that many jobs around im afraid that if i get kicked out or leave or whatever and i find a temporary place to live my mom might find where i work absolutely fucking scares me ill also probably have to just walk back and forth to the store wherever i work and generally anywhere else i might need to go and it gets hot in this area i honestly feel like most places probably wont hire me if i dont have a car considering that id come to work sweating bullets every day other than that in order to actually get money ill probably just try to donate plasma as much as i realistically can because i just dont have many other options there is no way id be able to go to college any time soon basically chance my grades are absolutely terrible and i am not going to get myself involved with the predatory as fuck student loan system not a chance yknow how in tv shows theres always like a loser character who just lives in a tiny apartment and stays inside playing videogames or just hanging out with friends i would genuinely be so fucking happy with that life just having my own private space to live and just being able to spend time with whatever hobbies interest me and just generally not going out much that sounds like the fucking dream to me seriously i uh do not require a lot to be happy lol not much at all but even like small shitty apartments are expensive now and i was never really able to learn about things like taxes rent or any of that because nobody really ever taught me everything i know about paying taxes and filing for disability i learned from secretly researching overnight on this tiny backup phone that i keep under my pillow everything just feels so overwhelming im turning into a legal adult soon but im not really excited unless i know for certain that ill be able to secure housing soon as well as a job its kind of impossible for me to really be happy at the moment and even excluding all of that im still constantly fucking stressed and physicallymentally overstimulated because of my mother constantly making my life absolute hell things just feel so bleak and hopeless if she finds out about this phone its over and im fucked i wont be able to research housing options i wont be able to communicate with my partner at all and i wont have access to abuse communities just any advice whatsoever would be lovely i guess just about like finances tracking down a cheap apartment or roommate getting a job taxes coping with the fucking debilitating stress anything at all thanks for taking the time to read this
trigger warning child abuse this is going to be a long post that requires some background i recently told my younger sibling a secret that we have been keeping until he was old enough and he did not react the way i thought he would i really do not know what to do now and i need some advice validation i am sorry for the length and how messy it will be this whole situation has been rattling around in my brain and i think it will help to write it down please do not be afraid to ask for clarification names will be changed for privacy i also do not know what community to post this on open for suggestions i f have three siblings i dont talk to one but the others i try to keep in contact with i will refer to the eldest one as frank and the younger one as harry when we were growing up we lived in extreme poverty and the recession hit us pretty hard harry was too young to really remember to extremely difficult times but there were times i remember crying because i was so hungry the house we lived in was also disgusting and we were never really taught the importance of basic hygiene our mother was a piece of shit she would sit in her room smoking cigarettes and playing on her phone and ignoring us at all costs she would force our father to get her fast food while we were to scrounge whatever we could in the house this forced me and the other older siblings to take care of one another especially taking care of harry i could talk forever about how she did us the older siblings dirty my father on the other hand i want to say he did the best he could but i know better he has a short temper and was prone to exploding and punching holes in walls trigger warning he was also the one who sexually abused me and my older siblings until i was about i have conflicting feelings about my father because how could someone do that to their child a person they brought into this world to raise and protect on the other side he took care of us fed and clothed us after i turned i started isolating myself i kept to my room and focused on my school work made online friends a few years pass and i started hanging out with my siblings again and we became close once more i did my best to teach harry how to treat people with respect he grew up to be one of the best people i know which makes it hurt significantly more that he treated me in this manner at i moved out and i cut contact with my parents shortly after that i know this was extremely hard on harry because he was left alone with my parents despite our parents being horrible people they were better to harry than the rest of the siblings after things became better money wise they started to get involved in his life going to school functions buying him things etc i have this one specific example one time when the older two siblings left the house our parents wanted to go on trip i was about at the time and i worked a full time job and needed to give them a months notice if i wanted to go on vacation instead of informing me ahead of time they told me a week before rented a car and then left without me i was obviously very upset about this and my father promised me that we could plan a vacation for later that summer when they came back a week later i learned that harry had caused them to spend more than intended which meant that my vacation would suffer i ended up paying for basically everything but gas and it was only a two day trip in our tiny shitty car i am not bitter about the money hell once i got a job i spoiled that little boy too i am bitter about how our parents seem to care more about him though that is not the issue honestly just a little background to understand more of where harry is coming from when i cut contact with our parents harry was confused and hurt i also believe that our parents tried to get him to tell them why i choose to cut them off the thing is i did not tell harry what our father did i wanted to let him have his parents while he could frank and i discussed that we would tell him after he graduated but i ended up moving across the country when he was about i felt that this was a conversation that needed to happen inperson i came back to my home town for his graduation i wasnt going to tell him on the day of his graduation because that would be awful and that day was about him i was there for a whole week i informed him months prior that i would be there i know that week is pretty busy and hectic but i only saw him for about minutes after he walked the stage i was supposed to go to his graduation dinner but when i saw him on the field after getting his diploma my mother ran up to me and tried to give me a hug i stuck my arm out and told her fuck no she ended up running away crying and my father told me that they didnt appreciate the attitude honestly it was pretty cathartic telling her no and it was the highlight of that trip after that i made a plan with harry to see him at least once more during the week before i had to go back home we went on a minute walk and during this walk i asked him and frank to come visit me next summer they agreed and seemed excited about it and they had plenty of time to plan and save money flash forward to december of the same year i went back to see them during this trip i saw harry for hours at a local coffee shop and i stayed at franks apartment for the week i reminded them that i will see them in the summer and they looked apprehensive which confused me after going through the details they reiterated that they were infact coming to see me in the summer i chose not to tell harry about our father at this time because we were in public and this was also the first time i met his girlfriend so again not an appropriate time frank and i did discuss in length that we were going to tell him when they came up to see me in june february rolls along and i ask them how they were doing on saving for their trip to see me this is when harry decided to let us know that he was not coming he felt like it was unfair to him that we did not tell him what was going on with me and our parents frank did not cut contact with our parents btw and he told us that it was hurting our parents he also expressed grievances about how it felt like we didnt care about him when we were growing up and constantly teased him to clarify we would joke about his hair because it was a little frizzy and his acne but nothing excessive and we would have stopped if he had simply told us it bothered him harry also talked about how it hurt that we kept this big secret from him and that we didnt trust him to end it all he said he did not think it was worth it to come up and see me i was crushed my baby brother did not think i was worth it i left our group conversation and did not talk to him for months now comes to the heart of the problem in may i felt like it was time to tell my grandmother what a shit human her son was but frank and i decided that harry deserved to know first i got in contact with harry and scheduled a phone call between the all of us and this is where it gets super messy so bare with me please it was so awkward at first because i did not know where to start and frank wanted me to lead this conversation i asked harry if i should just say it or ease into it he told me to say it so i told him that our father would regularly abuse us for a span of about years he said okay this shocked me and made me angry ngl i was going to say more because i thought maybe he didnt understand the implications of what i said he interrupted me and yelled that he heard what i said the first time i was astounded i asked how he could be so casual about it and he said i thought it would be worse i dont know if i could ever forgive him for some of the things he said during this phone call i understand not wanting to know the details but he was cruel i asked him if he remembered our father throwing our brothers around and his anger he told me yes but i dont see how hard he is trying fuck that first off i asked how could this not change anything for him and he asked me if i wanted him to be angry i was shocked did i now that i look back of course i did this man our father was supposed to protect us and he caused us life lasting pain yes i wanted it to change things for him i wanted harry to at least grieve for our childhood i wanted him to understand us more instead he was apathetic towards it and angry at us he said that it didnt affect him then and it doesnt affect him now and that it hurt more that we didnt trust him i understand him feeling isolated because we choose for him decided that he wasnt mature enough on the other hand how could he forgive our father for years of pain and abuse and not forgive us for trying to spare him a little i had a panic attack in the middle of this phone call and left for about minutes during that time i tried calling my support system no one answered except my grandmother who was deeply concerned but also was in the middle of a grocery store i just told her that it did not go as planned and that she should call me when she gets home i had a full on melt down in my car after that after collecting myself i saw that the call was ongoing still i joined and things had calmed down honestly i dont remember this part as much but we apologized about letting our tempers get the better of us and i told them that i still wanted to see them this summer it wasnt until afterwards did i remember the horrible things that harry said and i dont think i can forgive much less forget it harry has not made any attempts to contact me since then and it has been a month or so i am so exhausted and i feel alone i thought i could depend on my brothers but it is becoming more and more apparent that they do not feel the same about me please tell me your thoughts

hey guys i just need some advice on my current situation i f am the eldest sibling of my younger siblings are f and m i have a stressful job though it pays me well and im working from home we currently live with my parents dad m has always been abusive since i could remember he used to be physically abusive but as old age kicks in he became less physically abusive but got more violent with verbal assaults and verbal abuse mom f has always tried to be understanding tried to make peace between us but dad only got worse and all three of us could not stand him he would blame mom when things dont go his way called us kids names in front of his friends and make up stories such as calling us useless who only knows how to ask him for money which never happened he would also tell his friends how rude we are to him and disrespects him as a father when all we do is tell him how rude he is when he calls us names like slts bastrds and curse us to get married to rapsts when he doesnt get his way so whenever he did that we only tell him that he is the one being rude and he describes that as being disrespectful but doesnt elaborate so all his friends believes him dad also makes a mess of the house and expects mom to clean up after him she works practically days a week i occasionally help with the dishes and housekeeping but there are days when im so exhausted from work i just collapse and fall asleep i dont know how my mom managed to do this for years as mom works too because dad refuses to cover the house expenses my sister f is moving out with her boyfriend soon ive also considered moving out but recently i got scammed and lost most of my savings so i had hoped to stay at home another years until i could build my savings back up however my main concern is that im unwilling to leave my mother and brother behind with my abusive father my mother is unwilling to move out because she believes that she could get into legal trouble for abandoning my dad but i truly believe this is beyond her responsibility and she doesnt deserve the treatment my dad regularly gives her we most certainly can sustain ourselves if we moved out but my mom refuses to she is already and assuming that she lives up to i dont want her to spend her last years enslaving herself to my dad work stress along with family stress the fact that i got scammed because ive been careless losing of my life savings and having to cope with losing my pet recently who had been my only emotional support is slowly taking a toll on my mind i considered therapy but decided i prefer to save the money besides i cant think of anything a therapist can tell me that i dont already know im perfectly capable of rational thoughts at the moment but living has been very difficult my friends all have rather alright families so i thought i rather not burden them with my family problems since its pretty heavy and they might not understand the level of abuse my dad is inflicting on us any advice or personal stories that could provide insights would help i just need another perspective as i dont know anyone who went through the same level of abuse my family has im just trying to make peace with myself and figuring out how to live with my current situation probably until my dad dies of either old age or taken by illness

so sad
my therapist messaged me this morning asking if we can call later today little background i started therapy without my parents being aware because of obvious reasons since im posting this here she told me that she wont tell anyone anything unless she legally has to aka concern for my safety she also told me she would talk to me before she does id like to say ive had social services in my life vaguely twice and they just walked out again i think i said something in thursday in my last session that could have caused concern for my safety and i cant see why shed want to talk to me today and couldnt wait until our next session unless its so she can call social services or the police or something im terrified social services makes my life x harder i dont want to go through this again tbf ive already got it all planned so if she is going to call social services i can leave the second the phone call ends my friend said i can run away to her house if social services are called because they honestly put me in more danger in many ways i am btw but just because i have that plan doesnt mean i wont be found and im honestly so terrified about that too also there are cameras around my friends house so i need to be really careful not to be spotted by them if i do run away im terrified i have been shaking all day ive been trying to do studies and literally couldnt because i was too scared i havent eaten anything today either which honestly isnt that uncommon for me but still i wanna cry
my dad is very abusive and controlling if anything that doesnt go like intended then he will start smashing and breaking things in our house like a child he even forced me and my littler sis to follow his bullshit rules such as we have to smile whenever were around him if not he will ground us or even worse he will beat us he always threatens us with violence if we dont obey him violence for him is always the best solution he always complains why didnt our house happy like the other families and will blame us for making this house not happy when hes the problem if your kids are always sad when they see you why dont you ask them why or maybe put effort into understanding them right he didnt do all of that because he himself is a selfish ass who always cares about himself he forced us to be happy whenever hes around like ive mentioned how can i be happy if im being forced every day in this fucking house is like a constant mental torture for me is there anything that i can do to keep myself safe from him thank you
honestly no idea where to start maybe last year anyways what happened is my father forced me out of my apartment i lived in for year after he and my younger sister moved in during covid because he lost his job i know huge mistake but my sis was and didnt want anything happening to her so he stole my debit card and was tapping at the atm and pulling out cash from my savings he stole k then when i went to check my savings i saw then and noticed that card was missing so i asked about it he started to throw my furniture at me and screaming eventually pulling his sks out loaded pointed at me saying i had min to leave so i ran out to my car where he followed me said to leave it as its his and some bs conspiracy theories about me try to kill him so on cops of course arrived then talked to him and me then told him to go back inside said they would let me grab what i could i said no its my apartment lease is in my name i rent the unit for about years they said according to him its his and im a drug addicted because that they refused to let me take my car and made dropped me off a rehabilitation clinic where i was found negative for everything but by that time my father stole the registration out of glove box and my insurance paper and they said with out those they cant prove the car was mine and refused to help me take it and dropped me off at the station where i spent a week at my friends on her floor as she was new to the country didnt have any furniture other then facebook market place free stuff her bf was small dick prik who didnt live with her and throw me out i ended up having to leave my job and hitchhiking across the country to my grandmothers where she was say i shouldnt talk about him badly to the people next door and how it was my fault for paying for the rent my self and groceries for people despite her sending him k a month that non of us there other then him knew about police still refuse to help me hes now forged my signature and registered the car under my sisters name because hes not registered in the province i used to live but is still in the current one im living for over years now despite live there km away ie insurance fraud so tried to report him for that but nothing anyways months later im getting a call from him claiming i stole my money back and hes going to call police on me if i dont return it because hes lots everything he stole i told him to go suck him self off days later police raided my place because i was doing side tech repair out of the basement and he claimed i was selling meth they found nothing apologized and still refused to help but now that claim even tho its marked false made my employer fire me as they have strict rules against anything showing up with you name in criminal history so now im still jobless missing a car and money furniture clothes hobbies total nearing k that hes been selling and wrecking who know who and out of fucking work fuck them and my grandmother still doesnt understand the issues trys to encourage me to apologize to him and nicely ask for everything back despite me paying her rent and building a kitchen and room in her basement fuck family fuck life fuck police fuck canada
hello all im thsense im f to be in a short while and ive been dealing with my mother for all my life go figure a little background im extremely fortunate for starters my family is fairly wealthy and ive lived a comfortable life since i was about i have always had my needs met and my life is pretty damn good im extremely lucky yes although i will say that in some ways the amount of cushioning ive had has left me with poor self support skills i am unable to handle failure well i am financially ignorant as i am unsure how to do many basic things understand taxes paying rent budgeting labor etc this is due to my parents trying to both shelter me and keep me from being dependent on them but thats another story entirely in any case my family is alright for the most part all families are in some form of dysfunction and thats pretty normal my mother on the other hand wields the narcissist trifecta of gaslighting hypocrisy and verbal abuse i on a daily basis have to put up with being called slurs made to do things because she is incapable of caring enough to do it herself and picking up her slack she is also extremely hypocritical and expects so much from me without delivering anything in return my dad is a hard worker and is stressed non stop because of his job and taking care of us i am also constantly having to deal with the destruction of my character and self esteem i can provide answers and examples as needed but i dont want to vilify my mother i love her very much but as adulthood approaches im becoming worried that if i dont get into college all financial support will be pulled from me because of her and me clashing constantly i want to know am i going crazy or is my mom truly a narcissist targeting me
so for a bit of context i m was a product of teen pregnancy my parents split custody of me before i could even remember the situation with my mom and stepdad was always horrific but thats a can of worms for another day on the other hand my dad while not flawless served as a solid foundation for my upbringing in hindsight thats all i could have hoped for however when i was around my dad succumbed to severe drug addictions transforming into a different person monstrous in behavior now that im an adult i seldom interact with him given his frequent incarcerations yet when we do speak its like conversing with a stranger hes changed beyond recognition from my childhood memories before he was addicted my father truly was an amazing single parent looking back i know he made so many sacrifices for me i have so many cherished memories with him despite this he now seems to have forgotten most of those moments its like my father had died and came back as this despicable persona wearing his skin i cant even love the father he once was when i remember the years of abuse and terror he put me through for years my grandparents and some other family members still naively hold a hopeful outlook for their son they even coerce me with best intentions into interacting with him but ive witnessed the cycle enough times to realize he wont change permanently despite temporary periods of sobriety or freedom from prison hell have my family fooled once more and ill have to force myself at a safe distance as i hear about how my dad is yet again back to his old habits whilst also leeching off of my poor beloved gullible grandparents to be truthful i dont think i will ever be ever to see him in a positive light again even if he were to clean up his act permanently nothing not even time is going to restore his drug corroded brain beyond the intellect and personality of a dangerous child nothing can make me forget the feeling of dread after getting home from school nothing can make me forget the pure psycotic episodes nothing can make me forget the fact you ruined my permanently and fundamentally tore my grandparents apart nor the fact you were also abusive to my grandfather nothing can make me forget waking up to being dragged by my hair out of my grubby floor spot at am nothing can erase the permanent physical and mental damage from being choked and punched nothing can ease the constant paronia and dread from being stalked after finally having enough legal evidence to emancipate i miss my father greatly but that man is gone forever yet i cant even mourn him when i was youngerish just a few years back i was filled with so much anger it was noticable and poisonous i hateful towards him and vindactive to loved ones who tried to help me move on i would fantasize about revenge now that i was older and stronger then he got nearly beat to death in prison seeing him in that bedridden state broke me his face and limbs were haunting a jumbled mess of blood filled eyes black splotches bandaged wounds disjointed features and grotuesqly swollen features from literally being kicked into the ground i could never do that to him or anything remotely close i felt so incredibly guilty this is what i had wanted for so long but it wasnt i didnt know what i wanted i still dont he was so frail then and still is now i dont doubt his life has been harsh in the recent years this was the man who did so much to support me through two bouts of cancer i probably wouldnt have survived without him this was the man who constantly stuck his neck out to act as my shield against my mothers abuse and neglect this was the man who would make me blueberry pancakes before school just to silently say i love you yet this isnt he is not that man anymore if he wasnt changed by his years of substance abuse he was definitely changed by his head trauma i had realized this during our most recent actual conversation some years ago it struck me that this man was seriously disabled now as well as cognitively impaired this may be the consequenses of his actions but it is both disturbing and heartrending to see the father i once admired go through such daily misery and bodily suffering i cant hold any resentment for this man anymore hating him would be like hating a child substance abuse and head trauma has irreversibly altered him leaving me with a lingering sense of melancholy and pity rather than resentment in conclusion i often find myself wishing he had passed away peacefully long ago sparing us both from this ongoing pain its a sentiment that fills me with selfhatred tldr my dads struggles with addiction have left him less than a shadow of his former self and its a source of profound sadness for me
a recent development through therapy that ive found about myself is that im absolutely terrified of being in a relationship platonic or romantic im terrified growing up was chaotic i lived a balance of abuse and neglect when my parents were home i was a frequent target for my moms emotional verbal and occasionally physical abuse my dad is a door mat who never stood up for us myself and older sisters who got out of dodge years before i could but then they would leave for days starting when i was young i had to become independent young i dont wanna trauma dump but i want to share enough to make this post make sense through this time i also witnessed my sisters be abused like i was they had much different responses to the abuse then me where my oldest dove headfirst into a small group of friendships my older sister was everyones friend and never was in the house i saw her and my oldest sister get punished for creating these relationships and frequently my parents would shame them to me about their relationships i coped through being the under the radar daughter the doing sufficiently to pass but not gain too much attention for grades or other achievements daughter i kept to myself and didnt build relationships romantic or platonic because i was trying to be invisible ive been out on my own now for the last years ive grown so much and feel like i can at least hold a conversation and start a relationship but i have no idea how to build a healthy relationship i know how to love others i jokingly call myself a universal donor of love i can give every type of love away i just dont know how to receive love or even how to create a loving relationship that actually will last people terrify me but i dont want to be alone forever anywho if anyone is actually still reading this id appreciate if you could share advice stories or tips
throw back to my husband at the time m and i f had just gotten engaged graduated college and began searching for houses at the time we were living with my parents a little back story back in college we had just bought a dog and were living in an apartment when we found it had mold i was sick from it my parents told me that my dog would die from it if we didnt leave and insisted we move in with them and commute minutes to college to which i agreed i am their only child btw i had a rough upbringing i thought i was just rebellious but am realizing now they are control freaks my dad told me when i was that he put a gun to his head outside and almost pulled the trigger and it would have been my fault my mom called me fat multiple times forced me into pageants i didnt want to do she saw my bf kissing me once and wouldnt talk to me for months couldnt even be in the same room as me or look at me without crying oh and she kept saying its just my first wedding every chance she got they both told me that being a labor and delivery rn is gay and that i would be a terrible nurse but i have proved them wrong there is much more in between all of this but heres some my husband and i were searching for houses we were going to buy one when we told my parents wed be moving out they begged us to stay said we could transform the garage into a living space and they would move out there they said they would sign the house over to us my husband was fond of the idea since he didnt want to live in a neighborhood and my parents have acres i was not fond of it but knew we would save money in the long run so we got a contractor and cashed out my husbands inheritance from his deceased father he died when my husband was i used all of my savings to help pay it amounted to about k after everything as soon as we paid my parents demeanor changed they became rude and insensitive saying all sorts of horrendous things they began heavy drinking mid because my grandma died and their life was over the drinking got worse my dad called me a bitch for not wanting to pay k for painters i told them we would paint it ourselves it wasnt good enough for them they have caused fights about us throwing out a paint can screaming one hundred dollars isnt a lot to you but it is to us and proceeded to say they dont know how its going to work here and that they might just take us off everything flash forward to many stupid fights later we are here and they havent signed the house over they claim they are trying to merge the property from my grandma to their house then they will sign it over we put an additional k into much needed upkeep that they fell short on for years im currently pregnant with our first two children we have had many fights over the dumbest shit i could go into so many details but we would run out of space they have made claims that were taking advantage of them how theyve sacrificed so much and we havent done anything for them they blew their top over a paint can saying dollars isnt much to you but it is to us they have threatened to not add us on the house and have said multiple times this isnt going to work even better my dad and mom refused to stop smoking and drinking around my babies because it doesnt affect them i used to visit every day before i got pregnant and was super sick but now i visit once a week but that seems to not be good enough it was my baby shower today keep in mind my mom didnt throw me a bridal shower and claimed she was too busy with the renovation even though my husband and i were handling everything she didnt offer to throw me a baby shower either my husbands grandma and my friend did last night i texted my mom saying that we would be leaving at i figured we would be riding together since we live together and she is going to be a grandma well my mom ignored me and had my father text me he told me that she wont be riding with me and she will be riding with a cousin i told him i think that looks poor given she is the grandma and shouldnt be arriving with other guests he texted me saying my husband told him that we cant give my mom a ride i know this is not true what happened was that my husband took the dogs out and at the time had a lot on his mind from work my dad said my mom will need a ride to the shower my mom insisted she didnt and would drive herself their car is old and breaking which they have also insinuated that we should be buying them a car my husband said that either way works and just let us know continuing my father told me that he doesnt want to leave anything to us because of this and i left it at that in the morning my mom texted saying she wants to ride with us which we agreed she never apologized for the behavior or anything just pretended like nothing was wrong my shower was less than ok my entire family breezed past me barely asked about my pregnancy or the babies and talked to my mom i sat in the corner with my friend and husbands grandma while my mom entertained

the shower basically felt like a show for her my cousin said i heard you and my dad built a tiny house that must have been expensive my mom says yeah we did i walked over and said that my husband and i paid for it it was asked why my husband and i arent living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one i told them it wasnt our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house my mom didnt sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after after the shower everyone left and i said to my mom that i wasnt aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything she screamed to of her lungs you cant keep doing this to me my husbands grandpa definitely heard so do you think shes in the right and has scarified more than

my mom pulled my hair really harsh intentionally today before i go out to eat at a restaurant with dad she said that my acne looks really bad and my hair is messy and she got mad at me for that so she started combing my hair it hurts for a little so i grabbed my scalp to prevent it from hurting and she got annoyed from that because it was in her way and so she said something like is your scalp that valuable in a sarcastic manner and she just pulled my hair really harsh and yelled at me when i yelp as if she expected me to be quiet after pulling my hair really harsh this is something she would always do she would point out my every little flaw on my appearance when its so obvious as if i dont know i would often get scolded or i think is what i want to call bullying by my own family members they will continue on and on mocking me and i would act as if it was nothing and take it as a joke but i think its also my own fault for having really bad acne my mom bought me some products for my skin care and i swear i use it i thought that my skin has gotten better than before but my mom still kept calling it disgusting and ugly she likes to comment on my body pointing out how fat i look im tall and is kg i take her insulti guess as a thought of her caring about me despite the harsh things that she does on my body im not sure about how i should feel about my mom she can be so sweet sometimes yet get mad at me for everything and im trying my best to be a good daughter and i dont really have anyone else to turn to or talk about my mom toa little bit of personal information of the reasons why im very worried to talk to my dad about my mom because hes one of the person that i really hate the most in my life and hes divorced with my mom and so im afraid that if i talk about my mom with him he would get her into some kind of trouble and i also dont want to talk to my brother about how i feel too because i think he definitely doesnt understand how i feel and what i think and weve never talk about something like this to each other anyway and with my other family members like grandparents and uncle trust me ive tried telling them many times but they ended up telling my mom about what i say to them or ended up being on my mom side and also telling me to listen to her
like they say shit like do you know that we had to take a loan for this fridgethis computer cost pounds etc like hwy
like im in foster care and they keep saying when you come home like why would i want to come to your abusive household anways
lmao

okay so this may seem weird but its like a genuine thing ive been struggling with warning i dont have a lot of memories so if she has like done anything severely bad so me i will not remember but uh basically im a teen lived with her all of my life my dad is out of the picture and for an extremely good reason i know shes extremely emotionally abusive always yelling blaming stuff on us getting mad at me oldest in the house in particular she also let me start smoking at uh she threatens physical abuse shes let my uncle whos long moved out burn my brothers hands with lighters and hit them as well as shes hit mea couple times but not badly just like a cuff around the head nd shit as well as she doesnt really get painkillers anymore ngl could be my fault but i deal with extreme migraines got them from her as well as undiagnosed knee issues also from her and she never gets painkillers no matter how much i beg her to she also lets me and my brothers get into physical fights and by that i mean they have kicked my knee out as well as nearly fractured my arm both of them are younger then me and both have severe mental health issues which they are on pills for but my mother simply reminds them and then moves on with her day and gets mad when they dont take them she doesnt stop the fights and i do not initiate the fights because well im almost my brothers are four years younger thats all i can remember but like yeah i just wanna know because my friend says she does but i honestly dont think so but could that just be me in denial
i y have been abused by my parents and grandparents for as long as i can remember my first memory is my grandad approaching me as i was sat down on a potty one of those weird plastic toilets toddlers have and picking my up by my shoulders he screams something at me before he puts me down and slaps me across the face i was about years old i feel the best way to talk about this lifetime of abuse is to tell it in chronological order from the best of my ability my memory surrounding certrain things is hazy as for a while i tried to forget as much of this as i could firstly i think its important to give some information about my mum and dad my dad was when i was born and i believe my mum was he lied to her about his age my dad is addicted to weed and i know for a time he was addicted to coke too i remember he would often get arrested a lot he would also say he was leaving us but return hours later very clearly off his face on coke and whatever else my mum is a very manipulative and emotionally abusive woman when i was i witnessed her kiss another man in front of me we later on found out that they had been seeing each other for ages behind my dads back i havent been able to forgive her for that its also important to note i have many siblings i wont say how many as i have already given a lot of telling information and do not want my family to know ive typed and posted this many of my family members use reddit from the age of i remember getting beatings almost daily from my mum or dad these would be for the most minor of things such as forgetting to flush the toilet or turning the tv up a little bit too loud these werent little taps either i got fully manhandled and punched often i remember my dad pinning my down so my back is facing upwards he would hold my hands around my back while my mum would hit me on my ass until it was red raw no one can justify that sometimes it wasnt always my parents though sometimes they would call my grandad for such a long time the word grandad evoked so much fear in me when i was told he was coming over i would run to my room but on as many layers of clothes as i could and hid under my blanket when he arrived he would berate me about how much of a disgusting little cunt i was before he would punch me in my face and all over my body often i would have bruises as a kid i dont know how teachers at school didnt pick up on it i remember one christmas eve my xbox account wasnt working cant remember why and this understandably upset me i was after all my dad called my grandad over and i did the same routine clothes on over the covers and pray he doesnt hit me too hard this time this time was different though he came into my room and pulled me out of my bed by my arm and threw me down the stairs i ran into the living room where my nana was she slapped me in my face so hard i fell to the ground i tried to run out of the room only for my grandad to push me back into it i was made to sit on the couch while i got called the most horrific names i was so scared i wet myself and couldnt stop shaking i was years old not long after christmas it was my birthday i got disney infinity and a bunch of the little figures to go with it for months this was my hyper fixation i would play it daily and completed everyone one of the story set things i had one day my grandad came over and he started his usual borage of insults he turns to my organized disney infinity figures resting upon my xbox jesus im old and kicks them all over just avoiding the xbox he then turns around and leaves he broke so many of the figures i cried for hours and hours in my room alone no one came to check on me the figures being broken hurt so much more than the beatings i was now used to from this point onwards things are a little fuzzy i move house a few times and am now in secondary school im years old and questioning my sexuality heavily i get into fights both inside and outside of school and have started smoking cigarettes the physically abuse had stopped but the emotional abuse had got worse at the time i was a very fat kid i would eat to feel better my dad would often call me fat and insult me for everything i did every song i played booked i read and film i watched he would rip into me daily for no reason at all he would often say if i wasnt his kid and he saw me when he was a kid hed beat the fuck out of me when i was life started to get a bit better i found a group of friends that liked me i was no longer questioning my sexuality and was fully comfortable saying i was pansexual i also started to smoke weed with my best friend which has given us some of the best memories in the summer of that year we got evicted from our home and had to move into an emergency house this was hell and one of the worst times of my life i slept on the couch and my pc was in the kitchen where often my little siblings would throw food on it and try to tip if over my parents did nothing to stop this the insults still followed and i was made to feel so insignificant and small the most i slept in the months we lived there was hours a night one time my dad was berating me and he got in my face because i said something back to him he pinned me against the wall by my t shirt for the first time i felt all of the rage i had kept bottled up since i was a kid overflow and i punched him square in the face he fell back and looked at me in shock my mum rushed to his defense and screamed at me to leave i left for a few hours until my dad called me and told me to come home we havent spoken of it since now i am i am in the last few days of college then im off to university the emotional abuse still continues and there are so many things that im leaving out for the sake of length i could genuinely write a novella about all of this shit i am not sure what to do moving forward i really want to block them out and live my life peacefully and free however whenever i think about doing this i feel really guilty luckily i have an amazing and supportive partner who is helping me make sense of all of this the scars still feel fresh for anyone who is in a similar situation but has years to wait before they can leave keep your head up right now i know it is hell and it seems like there is no end my best advice is find something you love and cling onto it passion is found in the darkest of place in my case it was films you are not crazy or being sensitive it is abuse any question feel free to ask thank you for listening edit sorry if some of this makes no sense im dyslexic haha
hello everyone i just want to share this ongoing story cuz ive been trying to wrap my head around it for years now and would really appreciate the feedback so when i was about years old i was adopted by my aunt and uncle whom i know call my mom and dad because i have no other living parents that i know of and when they were in the process of adopting me apparently they were told by multiple medical professionals and child psychologist that i was going to have trouble growing up they told my adoptive parents to always keep me on a routine and stuff like that but anyways ive had my fair share of hard times with them mainly after i turned because that is when i started having more intense mental health issues i was in and out of hospitals amd behavioral health centers until one fateful incident where my parents refused to pick me up from the facility from that point i went back into the same system that i was adopted out of i was at this point i couldnt understand and still dont understand certain things that happened during that time i didnt understand why when i tried to cally parents they refused to speak with me called me a monster and told me to stay away from them when i simply wanted to know when they were gonna pick me up i didnt understand why shortly afterwards i had to sit in a courtroom with my adoptive parents who couldnt even look at me if say hi to me i thought courtrooms were only for criminals so what am i doing there ya know they charged my adoptive parents with child abandonment but their parental rights were never terminated because they used my own mental health issues as a defense basically telling the judge that the only reason they didnt want to take care of me anymore is because of the trouble theyve had to go through with raising someone with so many various issues when i did get a chance to speak with them they told me that they put me back in system because they love me and wanted to get the right treatment for me now heres where the problem lies i have spent from age to age going from house to house group home to group home that whole time while they were expecting me to get treatment i had to face abuse confusion unstable housing and education all the while wondering why my parents pulled me out of the child welfare system just to put me back in it they barely tried to see me when i was in state custody but whenever the courts or my caregivers wanted to change something they would miraculously pop up and try to paint themselves as superior by saying we still have our rights thats still our kid etc fast forward to when i turned and i age out of traditional foster care to go into extended foster care namely because my parents still didnt want to take me back after all those years of separation even after i stabilized and got on the right combination of meds ive always struggled with determining if all the confusion and mental turmoil that i was put through was indeed an act of parental love or not it only confuses me further when i see parents who have kids with birth defects and developmental delays but those parents would never try to hand their kid off to the state simply because they didnt want to deal with their child so i just dont understand any of this even at age now once i turned my adoptive parents started to make themselves more present in my life noticably after they found out that i was entitled to a bunch of benefits as a result of my circumstances nowadays if i stand up for the feelings that i do have or my distaste for how they deserted me when i needed them the most my adoptive parents shut me down and call me rude and say that i dont know what im talking about even though i live about miles away from them theyll hound and harass me for favors and if i dont have anything to give them mainly because i dont owe them anything for the trauma ive endured then they call me rude and a horrible daughter im starting to feel like im only as valuable to them as the things that i can contribute when i do try to nurture some kind of bond with them then they love me but as soon as i stand up for myself then im crazy and dont know what im talking about according to them i have a goal of buying my first house soon and i want to save up money for that my parents know about that goal but yet they still hound me for money almost like they dont actually want me to be able to stand on my own two feet for about months now ive been no contact with them because ive wanted to actually take some time to process these events and many others and the feelings associated with them without undue influence or distraction so if you managed to make to this point of my story i would really appreciate some perspective and a better idea of whether or not i should try to reconcile with them or just remain no contact and move on with my life without them all opinions are welcome thank you

my autobiography from my earliest memories my father has been a harsh figure in my life i recall years of abuse mockery and physical punishment including beatings with a belt one vivid memory is when my cousin bit me and my father praised him celebrating his actions another painful moment was when he tried to abandon me during a time i was possessed he criticized every action of mine and my childhood is filled with memories of constant family fights when i was just or years old he would distinctly say that he wouldnt include me in his will i had no understanding of money at that age but the fear was real his angry glares terrified me and i lived in constant fear of doing something wrong that would lead to further abuse he would kick me out of the house and demand the clothes off my back because he had paid for them at i was sent to a hostel despite my desperate pleas to stay my mother cried her eyes out but my father showed no emotion his frustration with me was so intense that even when i made a harmless joke he would get angry only to repeat the same joke himself moments later my sister pointed out the hypocrisy but it didnt change anything as i grew up my hatred for him deepened he frequently kicked me out of his business and his house if not for my mother i dont know where id be i eventually found a job and was given a month to leave his house i started my own business and helped him set up a new shop my marketing efforts paid off but i never received any appreciation instead i was always compared to others despite swallowing my hatred as advised his constant taunts cut deep i was treated like a plague in my family avoided like a germ when you are unloved in childhood you search for love to fill that void i did the same after seven years in a hostel i finally found someone who liked me at however the relationship didnt last i left a prestigious university because of my depression which led to more taunts and ridicule from my father i always wanted to learn to drive and begged him for a drivers license his response was dismissive suggesting i should become a driver to earn some money i tried to build a bond with him and things seemed to get a little better i contributed financially to his business without making any losses but any minor issue would result in a torrent of abuse despite bringing in thousands of rupees each month i received a fixed pocket money of just k rupees eventually i stopped taking any money from him during a period of depression i found love again for three years i was happy but then she cheated on me and i lost everything now i am heartbroken holding onto the hope of a miracle please dad stop abusing me if you want i will disappear i cant take this anymore stop
they contacted my school and the school talked to me i asked that they tell cps to contact me before anyone else its been weeks and they havent contacted me yet ive tried to talk to my mom about my dad but she forgot and now there both getting worse
ive lost so many nights of sleep over this trying to make sense of something so heartbreaking and evil i try to see things from both sides a mother and a son its all so complex and complicated you see people will tell on themselves people will tell the truth even when they think they are lying if you pay close attention to every word spokenthe truth will always be right there from the very beginning there were red flags things that were said that just didnt seem rightand it got worse and worse the little things said became crys for help god blessed me with a gift sometimes it can feel more like a curse i can feel others feeling i can see things before they happen i get warnings and messages most times they are correct and small about of times i get information tangled i could feel his fear i could feel his confusion i could feel his dedication to someone who should have been sacred to him but betrayed him with the worst kind of betrayal i could feel your fear i could feel this absolute control you have sunk your teeth into for future reference im going to list how it all came together its started with him telling me how hot he thought his mother was then when i knew he was avoiding you for no reason and not telling you he was dating then he told me about a conversation the two of you had how you confronted him about seeing someone and his response was you are seeing someone too that is not a normal exchange of words between a mother and son once you knew your behavior said a lot the constant calling the phone conversations that lasted hours the constant texts hablame yes mothers worry and call but not like that then finding out you never did his paperwork for citizenship but you did your other two sons that right there showed your fear and tight grip you have held onto him showed how an abuser controls there victim then the text messagesthe inappropriate things said then seeing family photos a picture can say a thousand words that saying rang true the body language was off the pictures didnt look like a mother and her sons it looked like a mother father and son then watching the interactions between you and him and the way you looked at me then watching him interact with his baby brother he didnt know how to be a father and a brother and it all felt so awkward he remembers every detail of when his baby brother was born yea people remember stuff about siblings but the in depth details he speaks of are of a parent then the timeline of it all you leaving his father with him and his brother and coming to and during high school right when you got pregnant with his baby brother you sent him away to live with his father in another state it was your shame and fear of people finding out and if he was not around you could pretend it never happened and date a man who thinks he had a child with you when moving back things were only normal for him for a short period before you started your abuse again to be continued

behaviors of my dad that confuse me between abuse or normality calling out their abuse ill show you what real abuse is calling them a bully ill show you what a real bully is crying ill give you a reason to cry making fun of less fortunate friends friends who live in trailer parks little money divorced parents etc yelling screaming throwing things on a near constant basis hitting not all the time and it is a joke or playful not being able to figure something out then livestreaming me crying as i attempted to figure it out slapping me on the butt playfully or to show affection even after i asked him to stop purposely aggravates me and gets mad when i have a reaction making do work on a farm for hours on endcoming up with new or unnecessary chores so i cant take napsplay games or use my free time essentially taking all my free time has woken me up on multiple occasions screaming and yelling after this happened twice i now wake up at footsteps doors opening and closing or hearing someone yell while im asleep because i am afraid its him coming to wake me up physically ripped my door off its hinges for sleeping with the door locked he broke the lock and ripped the hinged off in the process threatened to take my door for not cleaning my room it isnt very messy but i have very severe episodes where i cant get out of bed for days unless he physically rips me out of bed took my hand that was holding a loaded gun i didnt want to shoot and was crying and he unloaded the entire may directly on the ground infront of my feet and yelled at me constantly compares me to other people makes fun of my body and then denies ever doing so when i tell him off for being rude he either yells at me or laughs and says are you on your period or something along the lines wont get me diagnosed for add not self diagnosing but im sure there is something wrong with me but he always gets mad at me for having symptoms yells at me for talking to muchasking questions and now im deathly afraid of asking questions to people especially in cars because he yells at me in the car the most and almost crashed because he was occupied while yelling just a few things that my dad does that confuse me a bit i might do another post with more things but i didnt wanna make it too long
ive f been no contact with my father m for years now but found out two days ago that he has been sexually abusing his girlfriends kids the girl that my dad has been sexually abusing has apparently been in and out of rehab and mental institutions and just barely turned he has been in this girls life since she was years old her sisters described an incident in which they walked in on my father with his pants down and his hands in her underwear as she was sleeping my father had raped my mother repeatedly in her sleep towards the end of their marriage so this was not entirely news to me i never thought my dad was capable of sexually abusing a minor like that and it has made me question my childhood when i first started to try and have sex i realized that i have a sexual disorder called vaginismus which could stem from sexual abuse i have no recollection of being sexually abused as a child but with all that has transpired im starting to think my dad may have hurt me as well my heart hurts for the girls that he has sexually abused and i hope they are able to press charges im not sure how to come to terms with the guilt i feel as if there was anything i could have done to stop him from hurting others if you have had something similar happen how did you come to terms with it
here are some of the comments my mother loves to make youre nothing without me nobody will ever love you like me nobody will be there for you except me no one will ever love you like that talking about my physical appearance ive done everything for you i have given up my life for you whenever i do something she doesnt like she either tells the pastor of our church my friends andor says things like you cant leave the house cuz if you ever leave youll be leaving in disobedience and god does not act in disobedient children you should always honour your parents currently my ac is the only functioning ac in the house she sleeps in my bed and i sleep in a mattress on the floor she always twists the narrative so that shell be the victim in every situation so for example if i say today was tiring at work shell start ranting like you should see me you can at least sleep minutes i cant but i cant i have to do this and that etc keep in mind that i currently have two jobs she has one but even if i only had one job its not a competence of who has it worse in my opinion she will also make lies and make them so believable that even she will start believing them how dare you say that i have never told you that that never happened you misunderstood the situation youre right everything is my fault and i am a terrible mother the worse mother ever am i overthinking things or is she really manipulating megaslighting me
this will be a long read im sorry and formatting might be terrible sorry im trying not to break down crying what i write this my mom was also abused as a child ill make the short but she got pregnant young and her mother got pregnant very young fat my mother was raised to buy other people except for grandmother she also wants thought physical abuse and parentification as far as i can think back before i was my mother would use corporal punishment the problem was not the hit when i did wrong be how far she would go it would leave mark and sometimes i would bleed i dont know thats a i really remember whats that she thought i a child under the age of smaller then her in both high and weigh she is obese i was a little overweight try to push her i didnt do such a thing and she pushed me so hard that i hit my head well she was still hiting me with her favorite belt it was leather and had a key at the end of it that how to fake diamonds in it which was most likely made of glass when i was i was walking behind her try to get my phone back through communication she turn around tackled me down and when i tryed to push her off she bit my index finger the day after my principal found out as i had an emotional breakdown she was close to call him the cps of my country i dont remember what i said but i somehow confinster that it was a fine her favorite punishing was kicking me out of the house i was not even a pretty when shes not in kicking me out for things such as leaving something on the floor you keep me out for hours or even a day and i would have to cry to some random neighbor to please let me stay under the roof she also did this recently about a year ago and this time i was actually willing to leave the house i was close to running away until she decided to play the victim im giving the head of myself sorry she will often searching me or shame me for overeating any times i could just stop eating purposely try to get anorexia because i thought mom would like me better and she would constantly act like this to other people as well she would make fun of people that are really skinny or just smaller then her either by saying that the person looks like they do cheated wall and then practically force feeding them whenever they come to our house stating that someone is a pig and because i lived with her the longest and i stayed without the longest i got most of these ones when i was a kid there was a specific neighborhood i would have to go there was a lot of weird people for example after age i started puberty very early i had d cup at the age of a man straight up ask me how much it would be to buy me for marriage to be more specific its a cultural thing where the husband gets the brides family a specific amount of money to be able to marry the woman this incident was the first time actually so my mom doing something really amazing for me there was also another guy double creep me out and say really suggestive comments my mounted nothing about that guy constantly just said he needs help and let it alone until my uncle decided to take it into his own hands on the time when i was i think about i was interested in adult books i would listen to the audiobooks and one day my mother found out instead of telling me that this was not okay to do at my age she decided to also tell me that she was r worded honestly make me so disgusted off sex that i would want to vomit if i thought of it now on it starts to get worse at i had to do home schooling because my mom was relocating i was losing my friend its not to tell my mom that i hate it to a random i started reconnecting with my also abusive father the funny thing is my mom calls him abusive but they also have the same personality are you eventually just cutting off due to something so you decided and by i decided my mom decided and the things he did was to my mom try to make her pay for his other childrens things he has children including me yes he did sleep around since then i never had a good mental health i constantly contemplated ending things and i constantly had the chance to this time i was in hospital for a its significant growth in my brain the only way i could communicate with friends whats through messaging and emails that because i was not allowed to have those things due to the growth i lost content with almost all my friends except for one for so long i had no one and my mother never made things better everyday she would start a fight and even if you keep quiet and dont respond to her she would continue degrading you there was a hair stylus double come to my house and she would stay for just days she must have my sister saying that my mom is straight up abuser and she wants to cut her of my mom will constantly diagnose me a psychological liar a sociopath a narcissist and tell me that im the abusive one she would hate me to the point where we can turn to black and blue one day she found out that ive been trying to kill myself she tries to help me out and i try to build a better relationship between us think so seem to be going well and so she decided to say that you just trying to kill yourself because i had punished you im just trying to raise you to become a good person that was the day i realized i do not have a mother i try to kill myself because ive been pulling my whole life i lost all my friends i dont have friends i recently had to cut off my dad and its not worse because one of the side effects for a pill i am taking whats literally thoughts of selfharm she have to making me feel like a sorry excuse for human being by saying that i didnt tell the psychologist anything about her doing all these terrible things cuz i was afraid that cps will take me she said that i wanted them to take me fast from repeat she declined and i havent had therapy in one year now i can feel myself slowly regressing and losing all the work i put in for my mental health what makes things even back to the reason kicking out incident but happened a year ago the whole human started with her stating that maybe you deserve to be bullied turn to dad then she said im catching you out of my house because you decided you can be your own parent i leave and i try to go to my sisters dormitory she eventually find out that im talking to my sister and trying to get there and she starts playing up the water works she only wanted me to come back im so that i can give her the things that i took with me which was my laptop and my phone tell me eventually had a conversation and im told her that she is emotionally unavailable as well as the fact that she is a workaholic and excuses always that she has to save lives nursing manager the two nursing managers at the hospital there was more i should have mentioned but every time i brought something up she would twist actually i just went to my room and then she decided to call family members and say that i thought she was that and fake tears that was also the day i found that she would tell family members about how terrible of a child i am even though those family members do not think im horrible person she was twist a stories and say all im trying to do is raise her im a single parent you know even more to mention she always drinks alcohol everyday sketches always a very mean when she drinks alcohol as well as the faction ever has time for her children because of work and outside she is but she has time for everyone else shes financially abusive towards my sister my sisters not blooded towards me but rather make you a adult adoption originally cheat not believe that was abusers this is not my story to tell but i would just say that you promises to pay something back you pay for it you do not keep the money back but you use your lost money for that cycle continues oh she would take away the money that you search you would pay you back because she did not like that you said no you cant do this im currently in a private school i originally came from public schools everyone at that school is rich and honestly they make fun of you for everything i dont like it there and i hate the fact that i only have one okay friend and she doesnt even talk to me that much everyone else is not even a genuine friend who is just like bully and i have to deal with them because theres only seven children in my class recently today she beats me im so badly that my left and right arms what numb and red for the past the couple hours why did she hate me because i do not say mom at the beginning of every sentence i say it as the second word and she officially said that i realize i dont have a child you dripping like a ghost and outreach you like a ghost you always have food and water but just never talk to me and honestly i never felt any emotions about that im happy and she decided that im not a daughter anymore cuz a long time ago i realized that she was not my mother but just the person i have to deal with for years my plan as soon as i turn out of sign up for a job my school is really close to a shopping center and it gas station so i can try get it more time job over there my mom has my savings card so i have to try by the way to get paid either in cash or something this is for me to save up for law school or just in case i have to redo a year cuz i truly believe that at she will believe i will no longer be her responsibility if worst come to worst ill just join the army by i will cut her off edit i want that i could have asked to let me stay with her shes in a different city and she already has two kids which is the only thing im worried about but i would want get important job so that she doesnt have to worry too much about me

ten years ago when my little girls were and there was an incident at my parents house my mother is an alcoholic and in a tantrum she had convinced my girls that i had hit her i was healing up a broken leg and the girls were visiting me at their house from out of state immediately after this happened my parents put them both on a plane and sent them home to their mother my ex wifeand news that i had assaulted my mother spread throughout everyone in my life instantly i could not defend myself because there were too many people involved who saw benefit in supporting this version of the story it was like that by my mothers design to begin with now ten years later one of my daughters has reached out to me but reconnection is on my mothers terms because she has held on to her influence over her the moment i expressed any anger my daughter immediately said i wasnt ready and blocked me again we were so close and happy before this lie was told and i have a really hard time accepting that everyone still thinks i assaulted my mother and that i should be thankful to her for the chance to reconnect i have missed them so much and missed out on so much in their lives i dont expect my mother to apologize or set the matter straight and her terms seem like they have been set for my failure further reinforcing her hold i have no support on my end and i am struggling with how to handle the situation on my own i cant take advice from anybody who doesnt believe me because it doesnt lead me to a solution thank you for reading my post

for context ive been going to this church for years and i started singing in the worship team when i was for extra context i live with a very emotionally and verbally abusive mother who knows how to manipulate the narrative and always makes herself the victim even in situations that are not from her life this will be important later in the pandemic my mother exploded my stepfather and i would have weeks of peace at most and then she would get very aggressive and impulsive for around two weeks as well and then she would get very depressed threatening to take her life if we ever left her my church leaders knew about this because at that time i couldnt afford a therapist and i just needed someone to talk to i thought i could trust them fast forward to last year and it all came crashing down for me i started feeling like i didnt belong in the worship team anymore and i felt alone because they spoke awfully about mental health issues on my side i got tatted and i will admit that i knew it was against our doctrine but i honestly felt so at peace with myself and with my spirit and i dont believe ive sinned against god but then i went to church and they told me every comment and insult that you guys can imagine that i was too emotional and impulsive that i should keep quiet whenever i didnt like something about the church because i was speaking badly about the bride of christ that i wasnt the example they wanted kids to follow they werent sure i was fit to be a mother even though i was biologically ready im to bring a child in this economy and world sir please and they know im sensible to words because of years of verbal and emotional abuse from my mother i later got to know that they had meetings about me without me including my mother in which they talked about me debated on whether to let me stay on the worship team or not what they were going to do with me etc my mother had some influence in there and even though they have seen physical proof and heard recordings and videos of how she treats me they chose to believe whatever it is that she told them to this day i dont know what it was i started going to the psychiatrist a few months ago and i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my psychiatrist also recommended that i change churches and if things became too bad with my mother proceed legally i feel so lost and scared and i dont know what to do i left the worship team even though i loved singing and praising jesus and i also love my mother i know that she can be a good person but it is so hard to love her that it hurts its like hugging a rose with thorns and i feel like im walking on eggshells every day am i in the wrong
ive been in a relationship with my girlfriend we are both in our early s for almost years now she has been wonderfull to me the whole time and i dont think i know anyone more underestanding and open in my life she is incredibly smart and amazing at getting how and why people feel or act in certain ways she comes from an average home some stuff hasnt been great but generally her parents are good people and have give her a sense of safety she counts on them and talks to them all the time and she trusts them to tell them issues she deals with i on the other hand come from a bit of a complicated situation my parents have been for as long as i can remember psycologically verbally heavy on this one and sometimes even phisically not very common abusive to me our relationship has gotten a lot better the past year and i cant say i hate them for what they did to me ive been going to therapy for around years as well and only recently started really digging into the abuse and realizing how wrong it really was i came to the realization a few weeks ago that i want to tell my girlfriend if not all of it at least enough that she can truly underestand whats so wrong with me im fucked in the head and ive known that for a long time but i feel like if i dont explain myself a little she will never truly underestand the reason why raised voces scare me why i cry when a stupid movie shows a good parents why i panic when something gets droppedbrokenspilled there is also the matter that i recently realized i dont know how to tell when someone is being violent if they arent yelling and hitting my therapist says thats because i register anything below that as safe due to how i grew up but i find that very scary im afraid i might have been violent without realizing or that i will be at some point she usually is very quick to tell me when something bothers her and she has been an angel with that because im not the quickest to underestand social things but she always takes the time to make sure i got it and i always try my best to better myself for her she deserves only the best but its a scary thought nonetheless ive been thinking that i should tell her about all this or at least a part of it so that we can keep building a healthy relationship and also because sometimes i feel like im miles away because i cant explain whats going on in my head im unsure as to how or when and an irracional part of me is scared to death that she will think im exagerating or wont believe me my therapist said it would be best to discuss it after im done healing but i honestly dont feel confortable just ignoring the elephant in the room completly ive made some coments here and there before so she already knows i wasnt raised quite right i just wanted to vent a bit and hear you all if anyone has some advice or ideas its my first time posting in this subreddit so if im breaking any rules please let me know
i guess its kinda logical after me refusing contact for nearly years but im still mad she still had a way to give them to me through my dad but decided to rather make a quick buck of it some of the things are expensive video games and books i cherish very much i couldnt take everything with me and knew i would never see them again but actually knowing theres no way of getting them back is crushing me update i did something stupid and messaged her on a burner account telling her that instead of selling my belongings she should give them my dad i also told her no matter if she accepts it she abused me and that no contact is the best for both of us i know this was extremely stupid emotions were too high theres no way to delete the message i dont know what i should do i guess i have to fess up to my dad since they will probably contact him but im too afraid having to confront my emotions and my weakness
i am grown up man not good with social setting i think my family try to embarrssingn me on puropse i was just sit with my dad he immediately says about me negative comments he exactly said you look more hondsome and then told me my hair is very long and there is dark spot in my feet i got the same behavior with young brother same attitude for example i say something funny he says he is smart sometimes both try to humilate me in family gathering like my brother shouted loud out of nowhere that i spent years jobless and looking for a job in family gathering i just dont react what is the best thing to answer for this kind of behavior
i am currently f and i just moved out of my abusive household my family was both physically and emotionally abusive more so emotionally as i got older the constant putdowns never really stopped even just a month ago my mom does love me but she says awful things like telling me to die when shes upset and this has been said to me my entire life i dont speak to my dad or my brother because they are the same exact people walking around my home felt like eggshells because i was constantly being judged and criticized for being a normal adult woman my father hated the fact that he could not control me and did not show me respect he has called me a whre for wearing a normal black dress my brother learned to treat me badly because of my dad the depression and anxiety got so bad that i was thinking heavily about suicide now that i am finally free i dont think ive fully processed it yet until now and its been days to be exact i guess i feel safe more free to be myself without any criticism
many of my m abusive experiences took place while eating in family at the kitchen table one of the phrases i remember the most from my father is seeing you eating grosses me out until my teen years i was frequently scolded screamed at and even physically hit during meals for being a picky eater i was literally afraid of eating with my family this caused me several problems with food this is not the first time im opening a thread about this but one problem in particular that ive only noticed frequently is that i seem to get some sort of anxiety or panic attack when somebody gives me a more or less dedicated meal and i dont eat it for not liking it it has happened to me at least three times in the last one or two years once with friends once at my job and once at a restaurant i grew up receiving nothing but violence for just saying i didnt like the food i was given and up to this day it looks like i still react with fear when i reject food i wonder is this just me does somebody else suffers or suffered from something similar
i finally see it that family thats doing things the right way theres no guilt no parentification no anger no harm but theres love compassion and understanding the kids get in trouble but the parents take the time to explain why theyre in trouble and what they should have done differently i know i dont see whats going on behind closed doors after i leave their home but its shocking to see how happy they are ive told them theyre good parents but i dont think they believe me how do i explain it better without burdening them with my own trauma theyre insightful im pretty sure theyve guessed already
im years old ever since i was young i was under constant abuse with my mother shes manipulative shes a liar and she victimizes herself in every situation she religiously tortured me by showing me grotesque images of people being murdered when i was just years old she held a vacuum above my head acting like she was going to hit me with it she told me she had dreamt punching me in the face over and over again she would squeeze my face as a child she would stick her thumbs into my eyes she would yell in my ear when i was in fourth grade i broke at school and cried to the school that my mother was abusing me and when they confronted her she cried crocodile tears and lied to them and they believed her and made me look like a fool i am so sick of being in this life knowing that this woman exists she is a pure embodiment of evil thinking she is goodi hate her i hate her so much not even the infinite cosmos of this infinite universe could match a fraction of the hatred i have towards the drifting thought of her
so my parents lied about me and they let some weird stranger in and i got raped then i was mishandled by the hospital a few times and got stuck with a dirty needle edit it might be cousin or an old friend they are too gullible i just dont know but it wpuld make sense of how they got in then other ppl got in i know they issues i havent seen them in a while
i can handle having conflicts with outside people i can handle being in verbal heated arguments with someone but when it comes to my mom insulting me using my weaknesses or flaws against me my god its such a sour pill to swallow to know that i cant even confide anything of my personal life to my mom in fear of her using it against me ive always thought family is meant to help each other become stronger to help each other overcome obstacles not to tear each other apart over every mistake maybe im still too naive if i cant even put my trust in my own family member who else can i trust im sorry for venting if someone is dealing with abusive parents i hope you still hang in there keep going become stronger it sucks so bad i know
they are like the smartest people i know yet do and say the most ignorant and oblivious things my dad put hands on me unjustly period he doesnt usually do that but he still did it multiple times and my mom at times too so i go to the counselor not to call cps literally just vent she listens to me and then files a report without my knowledge you dont even have a say in it like that yet my mom loves blaming this on me that is literally the reason they came and my dad wants to be like well you shouldve come initiated conversation about religion and lgbtq shit cuz i left and im bi with me while just ignoring the fact that he put he tossed a computer at me and hit on me multiple times throught multiple months on n off now the cops sent some mail n stuff and my mom months earlier got a call bout the cps people escalating this i dont even think my dad is abusive ig but he has done some abusive stuff and ive said that multiple times the thing is they dont listen to me so it kept happening on and off but it happened not even that too it was just mentally taxing even talking to them bout this religious stuff then they just blame it all on me edit watching this vid on gaslighting and theyre literally doing that making me feel small and literally trying to change reality like they keep blaming my actions for why they keep when in reality the counselor listened to what i was telling her which was me just explaining what happened not some cry for help and yet they insist that it was my fault were also black so he brings that into it and the system which is valid but then tells me how im trying to work with the system implying he knows more about it even though they keep blaming me for this like i dont want to talk bout how u think bein trans is weird and how me not being apart of any religion is weird i told them my opinion they have told me theres now i really dont want it now and they wont respect that im and i still live with them and thats even more tricky cuz now they feel like they own me or get the right to treat me however or say whatever i dont know what to do even my peoples dont know some of em even abandoned me not even listening to me
ive just graduated high school so i feel like i can say more now than i could before but is my dad abusive i believe myself that he is verbally abusive manipulative a narcissist and mentally and emotionally abusive i think it kind of started after he came back from the military i mean hes always been strict but never to this extent he has said a lot of things so called out of anger like how he wanted to strangle me how if he has the option to not deal with my sister he wouldnt have had he at all how if we wanted to kill ourselves we should just do it and get it over with so he can clean up the mess and he says he doesnt mean it in that way what otter way can we take that coming from our dad my father has only ever worked his whole life so he tries to get us to help around the house which i had no issue with until he started just nagging it was something i wasnt doing right every time i didnt clean the kitchen the right way i dont cook enough i dont consider peoples feelings and not even with chores in the house im a kind of curvy girl and all he can ever tell me is how far im going to get if i dont work out i do or how ugly my back looks in some dresses he even said i looked funny in my prom dress this morning he came to blame me about protein powder assuming i used it all and started hurling remarks at me when he was the one who used it last i really cant take it anymore especially after my sister got in trouble for liking a boy and my dad told her he would only want to get in her pants and lifted her shirt to point at her boobs he yelled at her that boys would only want that from her she was wearing no bra i dont care if he is my dad but that should have never happened we are girls and he is a man that much self respect should be in his head but it isnt i havent even mentioned him throwing a knife and glass shard at my sister and me telling us to kill ourselves infront of him we wanted to at one point and slamming me against my dresser one time just because i was journaling my thoughts he does this thing where he forgets stuff on purpose to make us feel dumb or stupid about what we reminded him about too and its used on our mother too if its not his way then its no ones way a lot of our acting out was triggered by him he was the reason i tried to run away cut myself a little the start of high school and developed really bad depression though i can never just talk it through with him so is he abusive
ive lived with my dad for my dad for as long as i been on this earth as much as id love to get away from him and move into my own place for my own sanity i cant so the next best thing i do is avoid him and try to do my own shit i really feel he has had a huge negative effect on my psyche on how ive become as a human being he is the typical machismo alpha tough guy who feels like he is the leader in everything he is always right and is not willing to discuss or debate anything he is often always angry if not at me but at other things but since i am forced to live with him i often come under his abuse when he confronts me i dont argue i avoid making eye contact and just say yes and sorry to everything he says but nothing i do other than being gone is enough to satisfy him he even said once i am only around because of my mom who he seems to reserve his only compassion for he will even get unnerved and jealous if i show my mom care and mimic me like an overgrown schoolyard bully and call me a weak mammas boy my brother was heavily abused by him too and he grew up to be even worse than him my dad will often drink wine and get very scary at night times when ive had to flee the house and drive away because he will invade my room and try to assault me only for him to have no memory of it the next day refuses to apologize he will drag my mom in and twist the situation of my presence being a cause for her stress and imply i am slowly killing her he often guilts and intimidates me saying i have no rights as long as i live under his roof i want to get away but i have nobody to turn to i am far too old to be treated like this the only escape i have is to isolate myself in my room temporarily drive off or be at my job
my parents have always be neglectful but its so far rn im sick because of the black mold in the house im freaking out trying to make sure my cats are safe and they arent doing anything i am scared my mom said she wants to vote for trump this year my dad is a shitty alcoholic that i hate talking to but now i have to talk to him because my mom is giving me the silent treatment im so scared i want to move out soon get my ged get into community college and then get into a better college but she is keeping me sick all of the time because she doesnt care
my stepmom when i was five made me walk from the city to the country like a hour walk because she was mad at my dad i had blisters all over my feet my dad still stayed with her for a long time after that when i was a teenager and my dad finally broke up with but not really i would have to go to her house after school cuz he worked late and she would make my step brother who raped me as a childi was when that happened would make me sit on the steps outside of the house and leave to go see his friends i didnt have a phone or anything to contact anybody so i was just outside for hours my stepmom every single chance she could get would tell me my bio mother hated me and chose drugs over me and that my biological brothers were horrible disgusting people and i should hate them and that my dad wasnt my real dad my stepmom when we would go outside would touch my private area sometimes she slapped me over remote control once because i wouldnt turn the tv off and i wouldnt give her my tablet that my grandmother got me to give to my brother cuz he broke his would try to get my dad to spank me all the time constantly would pretend id hit her so my dad would take her side and punish me knew my step brother was sexually assaulting me and did nothing about it and told me to keep quiet and it was my fault

like two months ago i searched for advice in my father because i was really afraid of my brothers mental health he had told me he was not ok and as i dont have any source of income i felt safe to talk to my father and tell him like hey we need a little money so we can pay for my brothers therapy because hes not okay right now i thought he you know a mature adult and instead of talking me down or something he just started yelling at me some crazy shit he told me we should off ourselves he told me its all my fault he told me im a devil and thats why im fat and a lot of terrible things he was yelling all of really near to my face and i decided to stand up and try to punch him far i was desesperate he is way taller and obviously stronger than me and he sat me down in the matter of a second and started choking me with his hand around my neck i couldnt fucking breathe my mother stepped between us and separated us who knows what could have happened if she wasnt there i dont talk to him but my mother wants me to let it slide she has tried to convince me he just made a mistake im extremely sad i cant believe even my mother doesnt care about my well being and its not mad that man did that to me i cant leave my household because i cant afford renting or living on my own because im finishing my pre med degree and my mom pays for it i love my mom i just want to know what to do i dont wanna give up my dreams just for my abusive dad but it breaks my heart in million little pieces when my moms tells me to just forget it i really dont want to give up on medicine

hey i just created this reddit account just so i could ask this question i am a teen about to enter adulthood just graduated from high school basically my father always gets mad at me whenever i do something wrong which while seeks normal his triggers and reasoning is what is odd for some perspective one time my father lashed out at me in a public restaurant because when i was trying to get my straw out of the paper i accidentally bent it i didnt have a reaction to bending the straw it wasnt his straw i wasnt a worker there fumbling my job or something we were just eating dinner at a restaurant and i did nothing that day to trigger him everything was going well up to this point he just got mad at me for accidentally bending my own straw this was no an occurrence that happened when i was really little or something this happened earlier this year so you can imagine how easily my dad gets triggered by my mistakes he would also yell at me for being nervous which always seemed counterproductive to me but maybe im wrong he would insult me get mad at me for not wanting to spend time with him and when i would try he would continue the cycle and to be clear i dont hate jokes towards me i think its perfectly good to have a friendly laugh at each other but this wasnt that hed be putting me down and then get upset when i didnt want to be around him hed hate it when i cry which i guess i could understand no one likes crying all the time but what stuck out to me is that he told me he would stop getting mad at me and start trying to solve problems calmly with me once i stopped crying so with time i learned how to hold in my tears but my dad didnt keep his word he still got angry with me all the same i kept trying until around my last two years of high school now i just wait until im all alone to cry he also once threatened that if i ever got him sent to prison once he got out he would show me what it was like to get beat up this was because he once got into trouble with the police because i was scared he was going to beat me up i did not intend for my dad to get in trouble with the police but i was really scared my dad never punched me but he did spank me once with a belt i remember crying and begging him not to do it and he would yell at me to turn around i was usually in trouble because of school i am special needs and struggle with behavioral problems but something i did notice was my behavioral problems were either better or worse depending on what teacher i had my behavioral problems were at their worst when the teacher was a jerk meanwhile when i got lucky and got teachers who were nice people i did quite well in school it didnt help that my dad didnt even realize i was special needs until the third grade but his temper didnt change the only thing that did change was how loudly he yelled at me because we also found out i had sensitive ears so his yelling was literal torture for me this doesnt mean he stopped yelling just now he wasnt putting his all into it but anyways back to the whole threatening my life thing you probably thought this happened after he spoke with the police you probably thought that was just something he said in the heat of the moment nope my dad getting in trouble with the police happened when i was in nd grade my dad threatening my life happened when i was in th or th grade and i had never threatened to call police on him once i never even once threatened to tell anyone how he treats me he just decided it was a good time to remind me of how easily he could kill me and he didnt play it for a joke he played it straight my dad also try to weaponize my interests anything i was enjoying he would use it as a means to insult me or punish me i once told him i felt this way and he told me to my face that he is going to weaponize my interests which surprise surprise led me to being much more secretive about what im into which led him to being upset that i started being so reclusive he also wanted me to feel bad for caring about my friends during the pandemic i spoke to people from my school online and during a conversation with someone they opened up to me about how they arent doing well mentally and was thinking of killing himself i of course was worried about him but when my dad asked what i was doing and i foolishly told my dad i was worried about my friend he made fun of me and my suicidal friends this mockery of me caring for others even continued at dinner when he thought it was hilarious i was worried someone wanted to end their own life i wish i didnt let that affect me getting friends once the pandemic ended because now i have hardly anyone to turn to for help which is why i had to turn here my dad has also refused to teach me how to do certain things like laundry one summer i asked him to please teach me and he didnt he also would be too tired to cook dinner buy take out and then complain about how i always want to eat out and how its costing him so much money there are plenty more times when my dad thought it was appropriate to lash out at me but those are just the times i immediately thought of now im in a position where im so scared to be thrown out of my house because hell be legally allowed to and ill have no where to go i will starve my dad ever since i was little had always told me he spoils me so i always have this thought maybe hes right im just overreacting i know i told all these like im the victim but maybe im just a brat my sad does plenty of nice things hes given gifts to me but i dont want him to buy whatever i want i just want to be able to spend time with him and not have to worry about getting yelled at i love my dad i want him to be proud of me but i often feel like im not the kid he wants he wants someone else someone from his generation he always complains about my generation im not the kid he wants i just hope he loves me at least a little
argued with my mom over something so ultimately inconsequential she didnt even apologize after she realized her mistake ofc she didnt cause she never fucking does i said she doesnt even care and thats the worse part she said of course i care i said no she didnt because if she did she wouldve gotten an abortion knowing she wouldnt be able to care for teens and a set of twins i couldnt stop crying in the shower when i came back to the room i had to ask her why she couldnt have just stopped at kids why why why did you have to bring me to this fucking earth why mom why did you do this to me
so this going to be long ill try to summerize as much as possible so while growing up i was rd child and usually ive played alone cz everyone was busy as i was growing more my parents expected me to have all perfect grades since i dont do nothing trough the house mind you i was a damn kid and the only time they teach me is trough yelling by the time i tried to uphold perfect grades ive been bullied like actually ngl it would be rarepy physical but i was humiliated so much trough life i feel numb at this point i never opened up to them bcz we barely spend time together and whenever i had different opinion id be laughed mocked upon so i didnt bother anymore i was scared to tell them about bullying cz they yelled and always minimize my feelings i never gotten outside yes to hang out properly i never asked for something big or money or anything reallyand i was called spoiled so at highschool after so many ongoing belitlment to the point ive received comemnts like youll be no one and nothing i regret giving bearth to you one they it clicked and i started standing up for myself and ever since then it gotten worse at first i was being respectful and then turned onto me cussing specially at dad he is very manipulative twists narrative and everyone follows him despite not liking his attitude cz he is a provider of family the only time in my life he was to ridicule anyways is started as emotional thing trough physical abuse desk on the floor throwing things punching me and kicking holding my neck and telling me how i should be grateful for not being killed just bcz he can it gotten to point where i ran away multiple tomes got of phone broken cz i wanted to call the police and had evidance what hurts me tho my mom who was also abused by him in the past he was sticking by his side and pointing fingers at me that i was the one peovoking him so i deserve it never once ever anyone tough of maaaybe calling the police im now and deeply regret listening to my teacher who told me i quote he does that bcz he loves you ive been gaslight by peiple so much and all i have is resentment and hatred towards him we are now in more advanced country and ive tried being extra responsible cz i was not before and guys after all cooking something special so they have breakfast dinner and take it at work take time to make stuff like this cleaning picking up my little sister from school walking cz we cant afford car sacrifise my free time space to make new friends i have bo friends except online no money no real life support all cz i was honest standing up for my rights and im just sad and miserable i do have confidence but it hurts that ill the only time ill be acknowledged is when i get successful on my own and guess what i live in such culture that he will take all the credit for it im sick of this there so many things that has happened but this is the fastest i can tell thanks for everyone that read my desperate venting but yes im devistated that i look like i have a family but i really do not p ss extra points my family told me to keep quiet about this while dad has been telling everyone that i was being rebellious and was provoking him which makes it even harder to my my part of story beliable since the evidances are gone all i wanted is an apology and him stop blaming other for his mistakes so pleaseee if anyone starts to think heshe saidwill change im here tot ell you they will never unfortunately yes your family indeed can be selfish do not let your understanding become enabling peace

ive never really been able to find the right words to say to you after abusing me and my siblings for our entire lives you turn around and turn ur back on us with our own children you got a tattoo done and told me at you wouldnt tattoo my name because you were afraid of me growing up leaving you your a liar when i was you pulled me off the bunk bed by my hair and gave me pumpnots you beat me and put bruises on my thighs when i was because i stole marshmallow fluff even devin remembers it because the bruises were so bad i couldnt wear shorts and it was middle of summer you never came to school for me i would always for you in the crowds of parents and you were never there you shoved lasagna down my throat and while doing so you stabbed my throat with your long nails you hit me and my sister with a belt in front of other children and adults at a daycare my memory of that is very vague but i remember it happening because i wondered why the teacher would laugh instead of stopping you you used to take us to the police station when we started fighting against the abuse you pointed out to the police the cuts on my year old legs i cut myself because you made me hate myself you sent us to high school with the same panties and outfit on everyday no new shoes no new backpacks we got bullied almost every day when you found out i had sex for the first time you punched me in the face and arms and pulled my hair you took my mcdonalds paycheck from me to bail your husband out of jail and never paid me back you knew i was trying to save up to take my dog to the vet i have cptsd because of your abuse so i cant remember everything but im reminding you of this so you remember you are a child abuser you just didnt get caught im not much of a christian but i know god will make you pay the consequences of how youve treated me and my siblings i was trying to get out of a abusive relationship i posted about in other subs so youll see it there i texted my mom who isnt biological but she had me my whole life i have a newborn and a toddler and after crying and begging her to let my kids stay there away from him so we have somewhere to go she ignored me i know she didnt love me ever so i dont know i expected her to care about my kids but im really glad i texted her this because she likes to lie and act like she forgot about the things she put us through and for context on the part about the tattoo she did have her other kids names done so it was name tattoos she was doing i hate this woman i have one biological sister my other two baby siblings are adopted she took in kids she didnt like or love just to abuse them a lot of my biological family told me she used us for money and government assistance i believe them but i dont care for them because they dont help me and wasnt there for me either
i am i will be in a month and i wont be able to afford to move out my mom has always taken her anger out on me after my dad left i became the person she cusses out and screams to when i was she was mad at me for not having a job and she would neglect me which kind let me get into a relationship that was really abusive for a while anyway fast forward years she hit with this guy and made me and her move and buy a house and have him live with us i dont think life is going as good as she planned i tried to warn her but she took it as me trying to ruin her only chance of happiness i work at a chain store kinda like walmart basically and ive worked there since i was i had to transfer and now i dont get many hours and it pisses my mom off but she wont let me quit and she wont let me get a second job the other day she saw my car was a little dirty and she cussed me out and told me the if she was her dad she would of taken her belt and wiped me til i bleed shes done this to me before where she threatens to beat me since i was a kid just wondering is it normal for this to be the case im so i cant get a full time job and my mom hates her new job and takes all her anger out on me
about years ago my seperated mom and dad got into a huge fight over a ridiculous thing this whole thing resulted in her calling the cps lying and exaggerating about my dad and his mom neglecting my little brother that is years younger than me her lies started an investigation by the cps that lasted a couple of months but resulted in nothing due to this and a lot of different factors but the final straw being a two page a message about how shitty of a son and brother i was to my younger brother after i the day before told her maybe when she asked if she could eventually borrow one of my monitors in the future i went no contact with her and has been in no contact ever since she also went on about how she regrets every good thing she ever did for me and bla bla bla the fucking entitlement holy shit a couple of months before this she also committed a fake suicide after i and my dad distanced ourselves from her she swallowed some ibuprofen not nearly enough to kill and called the ambulance she later admitted that it was a call for help and that it was not a real suicide attempt even before the first call to the cps my mother once told me how my brother once told her that he wanted to live at her house which is a totally normal thing for a year old to do especially when you straight up ask him if he would want to live at your house and of course it doesnt actually mean that he wants to move there full time fast forward to late the cps got anonymous complaints which resulted in an investigation once again but this time they actually had a reason to be worried since my brothers mother who he stayed at every other week was not doing well physically which resulted in my brother staying home from school a lot due to depression brought on by the worry about his mothers health after a couple of months of investigating they decided to transfer my brother to my mother and i dont for the life of me understand why the cps didnt just give my dad full custody over my brother since of their worries were about my brothers mom they have yet to give him a logical reason for their decision which probably means that my mom has been talking shit about him to the cps during the my mother decided to help dad and my brothers mom in the case she was playing extremely helpful the whole time her goal of course being to take full custody over my brother the whole time which even looked like the best option in the end since the alternative would have been a whole different family so my only alternative right now if i want to retain my relationship with my little brother at the same level is to resume contact with my plotting manipulative probably psychopath mother she won my dad and my brothers mom doesnt seem to understand that they were being played and manipulated from the beginning and i dont know if i should tell them or not and a part of me want to believe that he just happened to be placed there by chance and that she wasnt plotting at all to begin with what would you do in this situation
for me its something bigger and much more complicated than that lol

and she immediately gave me that angry hateful ugly look that makes me see red every time my brother and i basically had zero friends growing up due to severely stunted social skills thanks to mother i love her i really do and i had good memories with her but where are the memories with friends and classmates there are none because she was a huge control freak she was always paranoid that the worst would happen to us so she didnt let us go anywhere to even make friends we only played with the super sweet filipino boy neighbors because they were neighbors whenever my brother and i would mess up in the slightest or if it wasnt our fault she would hit us and say you cant do anything right being isolated from mostly anyone else that wasnt family made us internalize all the ways she was being toxic to us she doesnt wanna admit it but i just know the angry outbursts against us was her frustration from working two jobs to support us because she was too stupid to find a man that wasnt an alcoholic deadbeat fuck face ooooh then she started going to church and reading the bible so she can feel like she became a better person but shes still stuck in her own ways im transgender and the only people who didnt accept me were her and her lapdog my stepdad of course she used religion as an excuse for her toxic ass ways i still dont think she fully accepts me to this day now to the actual topic of the title my brother moved many states away to be with his lover and is happy there of course my mother being the control freak felt like she was entitled to a text every day its not unreasonable but the way she is when my brother takes days or weeks to respond is unreasonable she would get on my case to text him to call her but of course i barely took her seriously today she told me that he still hasnt called she pitifully whined i just dont get why he doesnt want to i wanted to say because you kept him from having a real life but it came out you werent always the best mother and then came that piece of shit ugly ass spiteful face i immediately barked dont give me that look im done taking that from you and immediately went to denial i just left because she clearly cant handle the truth that my brother and i went through so much bullying and so much loneliness because her control mattered more than to actually see us grow as individuals it just makes me sad thinking she wont ever change her ways and that my world will get even smaller besides my bff roommate i have no friends and maybe losing my mother due to her stubbornness will leave me with practically no one in my world

my parents where super neglecfull in my life they gave two shits about rasing us and i was stuck rasing all my siblings they drank and never protected us when we needed is and always blames us for everything even when i got ssd it was my own fault even though i was however all of that changed when my brother was born he was automatically the gem of the family suddenly he was the golden child and they had to protect him from all harm they treated him like he was physically incapable of wrong and that he was the second coming of jesus christ in the sense and boy did he abuse that he has never gotten in trouble for anything he has killed multiple pets of mine and laughed about it but they tell me hes younger so i shouldnt judge him too harshly hes tried to stab me in my sleep before and has pulled a knife on me multiple times and they just say im being overdramatic ive seen him grab my other siblings and beat the shit out of them for no reason and purposely walk up and punch them square in the face for no reason and laugh as theyre crying its gotten to the point my mother has had to lock her room with deabolt in fear that he may try and get into the gun safe and hurt us or others he knows he can get away with anything so hes constantly having adult interaction way before hes he also has stolen money hygiene products and a pearl necklace given to me by my grandmother to sell off im afraid hes going to end up on the news one day for the worst reason possible i know hes going to commit a crime so grauome and heartless that hell get a movie made about him my parents failed at raising us but they created something even worse they created an actual monster every time i look in his eyes they are black like death and look like every crazed persons eyes i wished he had to struggle like we did because maybe there would of been a chance of him being normal i think its to late for him now and i dont think anyone can fix him they just keep making excuses for the behavior and they keep giving him free passes out of life he went to a therapist once but he doesnt supposidly actually talk during those sessions i hate my parents that may be harsh but i do they created a truly awful being that will hurt some poor family some day and theyll still be on his side i just wish that i could rip the dna i shared with my brother and parents off of me and throw it into a bin and walk away

i f decided to runaway today i dont know if its even considered that but i was badly beaten up by my mom today when i told her i wanted to move out and wanted to start my life after doing so she came to my room and begged me to stay and asked for my forgiveness but at that point i was so done so i decided to just pack my things and quietly left ive been her slave ever since i was a kid i was physically and emotionally abused by her i blindly stayed for years even after enduring so much pain because i felt bad for her for being a single mother i have others siblings in the philippines yrs old and yrs old and yrs old yrs old and yrs old here in japan we all have different fathers and they all left i was left with the responsibility of feeding them and raising them i feel so guilty for leaving them behind but theyre too young to come with me especially my little sister who had always cried for me when i was being abused idk why im feeling so guilty for my abuser as well for leaving her to raise kids
extremely neglectful to them mostly but she also actively encourages her other older children to commit credit card fraud she was recently arrested and the last thing she said to her yearold son was looks like youre going to have to take up the family business thats what she calls her fraud scheme now her yearold daughter who came all the way from florida to attempt to kidnap my older brothers children wants to talk about how shes not dumb because shes the one making money without even having to step a foot outside this is after her mom apparently didnt even have any contact with her for years im thinking this whole entire family is fucked their mom would also just straight up buy weed for her son and her other younger daughter she herself is a coke addict and would constantly bring strange people into her home where she had two infants they didnt even have their own bedroom shed given their bedroom to their older brother and they just slept in the living room on a mattress since my brother has finally realized shes a crazy bitch who never wanted to be a happy family with him hes been learning how to be an actual father my mom is actually able to visit them now that she doesnt have to deal with that wench either and theyre literally different children it just disgusts me that every time my mom reported her to cps they did fuckall not even when she reported that they were found with really weirdly specific wounds they just knocked on her door and shrugged when she didnt open the door ig
im not totally sure if my parents are abusive or not so i wanna see other peoples opinions so my dad cheated on my mom when i was about and he moved out shortly after before then both my parents were absent in my life because my dad worked during the day the only times i would see him would be early in the morning or late at night and my mom worked nightshift so she would often sleep during the day i wasnt mistreated i got fed and watered but i feel like i never had much interaction with them after my dad moved out me and mom left left to live with another man she found he was an amazing guy until he began using drugs and asulted my mom one night i did not witness it but i remember the day it happened a little after that my dad met my stepmom they started dating and she would often say things like i dont want a kid or i dont like kids in front of year old me eventually she stopped after my mom confronted her about it but the fact she even said anything like that really bothers me i started public school for the first time right after my th birthday since i used to be homeschooled i loved school and it was like a place for me to actually have fun in second grade my best friend and her mom and sister moved in with me and my mom i was so excited but me and my friend hated each other for the next two years her mom would always treat us unfairly babying my friend and yelling at me i understand i wasnt her child but still my mom would often take me and my friend to the store or her work to avoid my friends mom and i am pretty sure she played a major role in me being suicidal in rd grade dont worry i got better now at my moms house several years later there is stuff everywhere the house is a huge fire hazard it isnt as bad as those houses on that horders show though and i think the place just stresses me out so much that i dont want to help clean up instead i do things to keep my mind off of everything my mom also talks about her problems with me even after she has said it is a form of abuse my dad isnt a big issue but he is a very passive parent he doesnt take me to doctors appointments or make sure im not getting into trouble but i think my stepmom is the worst probably the best way to describe her is that its like im walking of glass around her one wrong move and it breaks and lieing to her is like there is a crack in the glass and i try taping it sometimes it still breaks and sometimes it doesnt i dont get yelled at or hit but i cant do anything i really enjoy without getting either scolded or in trouble i am a therian and i do a sport called quadrobics which is where one runs and jumps on all fours when i do quadrobics my stepmom would say something like if you act like and animal we will treat you like and animal even though i am just being myself she is overprotective as well i cant climb trees or talk to strangers online whatsoever she has rules for me that she doesnt follow herself like how i am not allowed to interrupt people because its rude though for some reason she is allowed to interrupt me anyway i could keep going and going about these people but im not going to i dont want to write a whole novel lol if anyone knows if this is abuse or not and if anyone has any ideas on how to cope with it i am all ears i have tried therapy and journaling but neither are for me thanks

my mom emotionally abused me badly but my dad never found out bc he traveled for work a lot he thinks im distant and unable to talk abt my emotions bc of him and thinks its bc of something he did i cant tell him abt my mom bc it could hurt their relationship and they love each other and i dont want to taint my dads image of her but i have no one to talk to and my dad is probably the only one who would understand bc he was abused when he was a kid its just not fair that i had to go through all that just for my mom to act all nice about me now that ive moved out and talk about how such a great person i turned out to be and to act like she always loved me in front of my dad and on social media and i have to live w it alone its not fair that i had to go through that and now i cant even talk to my dad or talk to him without crying anymore and what she did is hurting my relationship w my dad in addition even if i told my dad he might not believe me bc emotional abuse is seen as less severe than physical and theres no proof of it
hello i made a post in askuk or so months ago about my mothers emotional abuse of my sister they wouldnt let me post the update so ive resorted to trawling reddit for other places to seek advice so sorry if this is wrong too on the back of that post i reached out to the nspcc uk child neglect abuse charity for support they then reached out to my local social services on the back of this who then went to see and speak to my mother they raised the concerns with her and had a little look around the house and that was it they didnt make any attempts to speak w my sister with her mother telling her the social was happy and the case was being closed i then reached out to the social myself letting them know it was me and that i was concerned noone has spoken to my sister they then set up her head of year at school to have a chat w her with him reporting back to the social what shed said according to my sister he reassured her what was happening wasnt okay and he understood her feelings being in this position the social did nothing i kept the social up to date w any new developments from the home further instances of how my sister was spoken to how this impacted her emotional and mental wellbeing and a recent incident where she had agonizing tonsilitis but her mother refused to acknowledge it or that she needed to go to a doctors that is until i told my sister id take her first thing only then did she agree something was wrong following my last two further reports to the social i havent had any responses ive noted theyre welcome to get in touch and if what i was doing wasnt appropriate to please let me know id be happy to leave them to their investigations i just wanted to offer more context of what was going on in the home well today my sister has told me that her mother has let her know the case has been closed permanently they arent taking any more action theyve decided that im effectively being vindictive and trying to get my mother in trouble this info is coming from the mouth of my mother so im taking it with a pinch of salt as i know shell be taking the closure as an absolute win and confirmation she isnt doing anything wrong further to this they also told my mother everything my sister had said in that meeting w her year head all of this while knowing they didnt even speak directly to my sister once im at my wits end nothing has changed my mother is an emotionally abusive and incredibly selfish person im really concerned for my sister as shes about to go on to college and i dont want her mental struggles preventing her from going where she wants and getting to uni shes struggling enough as it is with her gcses and has self harmed in the past the house is covered in mould years worth my mother says this is all the fault of my sister shes its not up to her to bleach a whole house i still have to buy my sister food sometimes i took her prom dress shopping her tshirt stank and had stains of mould on it she starts conversations on topics shes passionate about with i know you wont care but it breaks my heart and i dont know what to do i dont have the space or money to house her until shes able to run off for uni were looking at her moving in with her grandmother for college but its up in the air everyone seems to agree shes in the wrong but the official channels who are supposed to help cant be arsed to do anything or even tell her mother that their relationship isnt healthy whether they think it needs their intervention or not ive had issues with my mother myself over the years exploiting me for lifts housework money being downright horrible when i moved out with my fiance being absent during the planning and my actual wedding day i did want to talk these things through but shed bail on any plans and at this point ive written it all off in place of just making sure my sister can be safe as she still lives with her im sorry for the long post im just kinda lost and my sister being subject to two more years of this shit is awful
im posting this in a few places but i need advice i want to move out of my dads house badly and i want to take all of my stuff with me because ive lost all my belongings before however my dad will very much call the police and tell them i stole things when i did not and i dont want to get in trouble for this as our local law enforcement seems to believe everything that comes out of his mouth despite the fact theyve been over here every other week almost for domestic disputes with his girlfriend and he has given them no reason to believe him we have a landlord who is a relative and my mom wants to have her there so she can watch the process and ensure i didnt steal anything but i worry that wont be enough any advice is insanely appreciated

im and i want to estrange but my parents have done nothing but help me my therapists see why i would want to leave but everyone keeps telling me about how hard its going to be and tell me that they would be a fool to tell me not to stay some even asking me over and over to stay in contact with them at least through college so that they can help me pay my parents have always paid for everything for me theyve paid for my fancy private school and theyve paid for my wardrobe which is way too large and theyve paid for all of my depression medication and hospital stays i on the other hand have never really tried to make our relationship better ive wanted to estrange from them since i was following a strenuous court case my father driving across the country and attempting to take me away from my mother by force him calling my mother horrible names and forcing me to agree and my mother egging on my eating disorder that started around by telling me that i ate too much despite being underweight and that she didnt care if i starved myself as long as i didnt cry to her about it and bother her throughout my childhood my father has always been pretty angry yelling at me knocking the wind out of my by hitting me very hard in the stomach and throwing stuff around my room making me clean it again when i didnt do it well enough the first time he also fueled my eating disorder by telling me that i was too chubby i wasnt i just wasnt underweight for the first time in my life and locking all the doors and windows in the house and screaming at me to run while laughing at me by this time though i was already pretty distant towards him and had been since i was around years old im not sure why ive been so resentful towards him my whole life but i remember crying at most of his jokes towardsabout me and wishing on my th birthday that i could parent him and my mother to teach them how to act like adults i really dont know what sparked this in recent years i fear that i have in some ways stagnated in my mental growth there have been many situations since i was young and up until last year where i yell and scream at them and cry during a wellness check last year some police listened to me telling them that i felt my mother was emotionally abusive and gaslighting me following her telling me that i could never mature as a person and become fully healed like she is and that it was crazy that i needed to heal anyways because i had never been through anything bad in life she then proceeded to tell me to tell her all of my issues with her so that she could write them down and present them to my therapist as reasons that i was fed in the head my father also has a habit of saying very wild things when hes mad almost a year ago now i told him that i didnt enjoy him and his mother calling me bad names accusing me of doing things i would never even think of doing and calling me and my hair ugly especially when ill get plenty of compliments on that style i then told him that even if i looked horrible and wouldnt get a job because of it that id rather learn the hard way that just take peoples word on everything because then id actually learn and be able to apply those lessons elsewhere in my life he responded with telling me that id end up on drugs homeless and with a gun shoved down my throat and he said that he hopes before i get shot in the head he hopes i remember him and how if i had listened i wouldnt be about to die that being said i also did something horrible and sent him an email containing all of the things ive ever written about him from english assignments to text messages to share with him all that i feel hes done wrong and how much i disliked him and the fact that it wasnt me blowing something that had happened recently out of proportion but was infact something i had felt for years he still calls me though and tells me he loves me and to call more sometimes it is me who starts being rude first i always give him one word answers and have since middle school my mother helps out to she buys me plane tickets to go see her and sends me money periodically it feels like as a kid i was hurt but now im just the worst person alive even if they have done horrible things recently i mean even if they have been horrible ive been closed off since i was a kid i even had one therapist tell me that it felt like they were trying and i wasnt this comment was made after weeks of family therapy though neither of us mentioned his comment on me being a homeless drug addict in any future where i dont follow his every word i dont know i feel like im going insane trying to figure out if it is me that ruined this that drove them to be worse to me over the past few years though ive wanted to estrange for half my life now i dont know whether theyve been abusive or if ive been sowing problems and am now punishing them by trying to get away
my parents are going through an awful divorce my mom has dealt with a love of verbal and some physical abuse over the years from my dad who has a lot of mental health issues and really bad anger issues he thinks shes the devil basically and is constantly cursing at her and being terrible to her and about her to me and in front of my younger siblings im doing my best to make it better for my siblings and im stuck in the middle between my parents so much and its so awful my dad uses me to regulate his emotions and guilts me into feeling bad for him and i tell him what hes doing is wrong all of the time and i defend my mom all of the time but i also feel guilty and i know hes in a lot of pain im too empathetic but he thinks im terrible and on my moms side and shes lying to people about him and ruining his life my mom thinks i deny the abuse and collude with him and support him i hate myself i can feel the anger and the hatred from them and im disgusted with myself i feel like such a bad person all of the time i dont deserve to feel good i dont deserve to eat i dont deserve comfort but i want it so badly im and i just want someone to hug me and call my baby and sweetheart and tell me im doing good and they will fix this for me ive tried so hard to take care of everyone and protect my siblings and i love people so much and i feel other peoples emotions so much and im failing at everything

so long story short my dad has high blood pressure issues and my sister has severe depression pretty sure these manifested from events in the house my mother has always been really abusive growing up it was to my dad and even now to the point his blood pressure is very high and she berates him she states she does nothing wrong and he says he tries to avoid her she has these bouts of screaming and shouting over small things like someone moving her cooking spoon from its place for example and and my sister has panic attacks and she carries on screaming while my sister states she is struggling to breathe im worried this will push my sister to the edge growing up i was called ridiculous things and even told to die at one point i started self harming and now im married with a good man and i stopped the self harming i have always been berated by her however i dont like the effect its having on my family im at a loss of what to do in front of everyone else she looks like she cant hurt a fly i thought i was being weak until my husband joined the family and he was shocked at what he saw hes uncomfortable and cant stay in my parents house long she doesnt have any mental health illnesses as far as im aware i dont know how to cope or get help if i take any action against her she blames my father i have never seen someone with as many narcissistic qualities as well oh and she also turned her own brothers and sisters against each other by talking about them all behind their back writing this all down makes me realise how crazy it sounds
my alcoholic hateful dad had been insulting me belittling me and as a result i ended up suicidal with severe mental illnesses negative self talk core beliefs im a failure valueless unlovable broken as in a machine and im someone who shouldnt have ever been born but whom i hold accountable the most is my mother she has been complicit scaring me into staying silent about the abuse i endured im having recurring daily nightmares about her a few days back i got an idea lets open up with my story and share it with her work colleagues lets send an email to every hospital personal where she works describing in vivid details the abuse i had to endure let each person judge her for her actions ive been told its cruel and i wholeheartedly agree with this i just cant stand her getting away with everything she doesnt have an intellectual capacity to come up with an answer more profound than a denial even if she manages to convince some of the staff that all ive written is nonsense the family reputation will get tarnished forever its satisfying to imagine having my revenge after being told to stay quiet all of my life to speak at last speak so loud that everyone will hear and make their judgement
absuive mom was getting worried that i was weraing socks instead of tights because it showed all the scars on my leg
in no particular order took me aside in the pet store right before i was going to pick out a hamster id finally convinced my parents to get for me and then pressured me on the spot to get a rat instead i got the rat talked so much during family therapy that my therapist had to tell him to shut up when i asked him to drive me to the hospital because i was suicidal he drove in circles in the parking lot until hed successfully pressured me into letting him drive me home claimed he was tough on me because i was constantly failing and i was only to turn around and treat my highachieving younger sister the exact same way when i moved out promised to stand up for me when i had an episode and got too overwhelmed to speak then immediately pressured me to speak to the director of my school in a room with half my teachers in it before hed take me home guilted me for not wanting to go on an international trip with my entire stepfamily during covid lockdowns almost made a family friend homeless during winter by kicking her her kid out of the garage he was forcing her to pay rent for because he wanted the space for his new jeep
my mum has been hitting me since i was im now to be more specific only when shes angry i love my mum so much but when shes angry its really bad she screams hits and doesnt let me talk im not allowed to explain my side of the story my dad also just tells me to shut up and in my house my mum is always right even though my parents dont want me talking back or even explaining my side they always tell me that me expressing my feelings is an issue ive had trouble expressing my feelings ever since my mum became abusive for some reason i have always found it much more comfortable to sit by myself and cry people my closest friends have suggested that i tell somebody about this but the problem is i dont want anything happening to my mum plus she would definitely be angry if i told anyone about this so im very stuck on what to do

my mom and dad physically abused me while i was a kid up until i was i learned yesterday that they were in their late s and early s in this period i was bewildered to find this out since at that age i would just expect anyone to know better than to hurt a child anyway this led me to reliving all the things that they did in specific there is one episode that i remember vividly they took my glasses off so i couldnt see and also because they would frequently break them in their beatings and didnt want to spend money to get them repaired and then the two of them closed me in a room and then hit me the next day i chopped off my hair and called the police the police didnt really do much they asked me if i was getting good grades in school i was my mother was a lot more abusive than my father who would apologize afterwards but he was also emotionally abusive and controlling they normalized all of this as being culturally acceptable anyway ive been away from home since i turned i left the country to study outside of in this period contact with them was once a week and for years i was not speaking to my mother at all in this period my father came and convinced me that she was sorry and she loves me and i began speaking to her again around covid in since then i feel that i constantly lift myself up but im dragged down by interactions with her she repeatedly treats me like a child and tries to take over my life when invited into my home i live alone and separately when i point something out she yells and throws a fit like a child one recently scarring moment was when she was driving me and my brother in a car and then we got into an argument and she tried to scare me by driving the car in a zigzag and reckless manner i hit my head onto the ceiling of the car and she said it would be better if we all just died she would kill us all me my brother and her the thing is ive decided im going to cut her off completely but i still want to maintain a relationship with my father i think i do like him but its very hard for me to move on from what happened i am frequently triggered and reminded of the things he did one of the big ones being forcing me into a career that i never wanted and making me give up opportunities that were truly exceptional like a full ride to a phd at an ivy league college pursuing my topic of interest when i am reminded of his and their actions for example while watching a movie or reading a post on reddit or some other interaction i admittedly call him and start yelling at him i am only yelling and not hitting or anything but it is abusive because abuse exists in the yelling and it just brings me down for a couple of days and then i spend time trying to make up i dont know what to do i dont think its fair for me to forgive and forget because things have been repeated even recently but i dont want to be so entirely loveless either i dont know how to depart from this cycle please help me

this includes physical violence im crying right now as im writing this and ill probably delete later i need to get this off my chest im a f just finished my junior year of highschool i grew up in an extremely toxic household but i didnt know it at the time i thought getting regularly beat for something bad you did was normal whenever me or my other sisters acted out of place we would be beat and shoved into the closet or the bathtub and left for sometimes hours if any of us left without him saying we could well i think you could guess what happened we would be thrown out of the house during winter with nothing but a t shirt and pants i would be grounded for months for a stupid reason or he would break my electronics my phone was shattered as well as my school laptop currently im getting my car taken away forever because i said i didnt want to work at a job he wanted me to work at i retaliated of course and wouldnt give him the keys to my car it escalated extremely quickly with him screaming at my face and he started throwing breaking things in my room as soon as he threatened to hurt my animals i gave in and just gave him the keys he hurts everyone and everything when he eventually feels bad he would buy us things or take us out somewhere acting all nice as if he didnt just beat us i feel like its had my childhood ripped away from me constantly feeling uncomfortable in my own home now im an anxious person and it takes me so long to trust anyone wow that was a lot
lol
did anyone elso do this
looking for some insight here i grew up in an abusive highly religious family systemas a young child i was sad by my dad and physically abused by both parents alcoholism emotional abuse and and toxic religion were also a big part of my childhood my mom and dad have swept things under the rug downplayed a lot and flat out denied or forgot many things they both responded with anger and have tried to guilt and shame me for speaking the truth in many ways my mom was a victim herself but sadly throughout her life she was never able to see my dad and their marriage for what they were she denies that any abuse took place and is protecting my dad i havent had any sort of relationship with them for the last couple of years and have pretty much reconciled myself to the fact that i need to keep it that way recently though ive been struggling more with my sisters who still have ongoing interactionsconnections with them they didnt experience everything that i did but there was still a lot and although they believe me that i was sad they are not convinced that it was our dad and none of them have confronted my parents about how they are treating me im wondering where to go from hereshould i try to maintain some sort of relationship with my sisters or remove myself from the picture it would be an easier call to make if it were just me but i have kids who miss seeing their cousins needless to say my husband is extremely upset about everything that happened and doesnt want our family to have anything to do with my parents and the sisters who see them regularly if the situation were reversed id feel the same way but because its me and these are the people i grew up with im struggling any insights appreciated
one of my earliest memories from childhood goes back to when i was no more than years old i was in the preschool parking lot with my mom and dad my mom would dig her thumb into the bottom of my shoulder bone where it really hurt to make me cry obviously she did it so smoothly my dad never noticed i remember screaming and crying in pain from the top of my lungs and she was so cynically saying awww poor baby why are you crying and continue and continue i remember my dad just standing there thinking it was me this behavior continued throughout my life once she got better with her technology she would film me crying i remember growing up the abuse had gotten so bad by the time i got to school i was always to torn up when i was i ran away to my neighbors house for help and he called child protective services the problem though is that she is so good at pretending to be the best mom so they did nothing to help me i still managed to make friends though the problem was whenever i made friends she would get in the way of my relationships with them i remember in th grade she asked one of my guy friends if she was prettier than me i hope he doesnt remember that whenever i got close to someone she would ruin the relationship and sometimes even yell at my friends flash forward to senior year of high school i had gotten into an argument with one of my friends and my mom saw her at starbucks and threatened her obviously her mom called the cops on my mom to this day my mom blames that on me blames me for getting the cops called on her she accuses me of drugs and being involved with the cartel currently she is accusing me of plotting a hate crime to kill her with cartel people the most absurd things come out of her mouth i dont understand it i genuinely try so hard to be good to her and i have tried so hard in my life to be successful i am at a top university right now and her facebook is filled with all my accomplishments she takes from my linkedin she takes credit for every one of my accomplishments when all she has done is make me want to kill myself from the youngest age because i never thought i would be able to escape her im back home for summer now and its absolutely miserable i forgot how abusive and toxic she was i dont know how i am going to push through these next months i would cut her out but i have a younger sister who needs my love her behavior just doesnt make sense to me she acts like everyone is a threat to her accuses people of drugs gang violence etc but really its only her that is the problem there is so much i have to say though and since i am on a rant i want to say one more thing from a young age she started telling me my dad was a pedophile she wouldnt let me wear shorts or anything revealing around the house because of him she told me it wasnt normal for him to hug me and that he always stares as me weird so i grew up fearing my dad only to realize he wasnt even a problem but they are years apart

ok so i was at my bfs but my dad knows them as my bsf he called like times in mins my ringer was off so i didnt hear it he went to their house cuz we were out somewhere with their mom i called back and he was yelling abt my room cuz it wasnt thoroughly clean i had to go home even tho i was supposed to stay the night at home i was yelled at for a while i was crying in the bathroom more than i ever had cried b we were yelling at eachother through the door when i came out of the bathroom he was really pissed and yelling at me we fought for a while and i ended up having a panic attack i could barely breathe i was gasping for breath grasping at my chest and abt to fall backwards he looks at me and tells me to calm down stop being dramatic and breathe he told me if i kept it up id never see my friendbf ever again be shipped to a private school and a boarding school i was freaking out and didnt know what to do im grounded for weeks and he hasnt taken my phone yet its also break rn and i just wanted to spend some time with my bf hes completely disregard it from that point edit im gonna add a little more context abt my bf theyre gender fluid and were born as a girl my dad thinks that hes just my best friend its nothing to do with them for him its a lot to do with them for me tho they are my safe space i was told i could stay the night then i was later in the day told he never said that even though he did and watched me leave with them more context abt me i am a transmasc female to male me and my partner have been dating for and a half months we write each other letters in ela im not tonna say the whole letter but ill break it down they said that they love me very very much and they hope that this wont be a dumb highschool relationship in my letter i also said a lot but i told them ik it wont im not going anywhere
so a little context i was mentally and physically abused growing up and when i got older i started abusing drugs ive always had issues sleeping as in sleeping for way too long but i would very rarely dream and if i did it was apocalyptic fighting for my life well recently i quit abusing drugs and i find myself having these end of the world dreams daily and they are super vivid i can remember every single detail has anyone else experienced anything like this the dreams arent necessarily scary its almost like i enjoy them though i absolutely hate scary movies
just been wondering about this since i dont think ill ever really recover has anyone here recovered either fully or mostly from the abuse they suffered as a child i understand that this place in some ways is not the best place to ask this i imagine that a lot of the people who completely or mostly recover are not on this subreddit anymore but im not sure where else to ask the question so
youve probably already seen this story in this community but as a kid i remember one day my dad was angry for some reason he walked up to my brother punched him in the nose and made his nose bleed it wouldnt stop bleeding for a while and we almost had to go to the hospital i did not protect him somehow like an older brother is supposed to do what bothers me the most about it is that i didnt think much of it i actually laughed at my brother i thought stuff like that was normal i failed to show him any kind of empathy this is why i feel i cant get close to others because i know i will hurt them due to my lack of empathy i dont want to hurt anybody i cant be trusted
i f am back at home living with my parents after developing a chronic illness at university my parents swear up and down that they will treat me like an adult they havent and its been frustrating but its fine because at least im not paying rent so let me start off by saying this my dad is a veteran with ptsd and bipolar disorder so his life has not been easy by any means neither has my moms from as little as i remember my dad being angry all the time for no reason too i remember coming home to him strangling my dog one day because the dog made my dad mad by making noise ive feared him ever since and even though he gets help through the va its never gotten any better i always feared that he might hurt my sister mom or i a few years back my sister who was at the time was upset because her school gave her a big project to do over the weekend and my dad was forcing her to do the chores so i stepped in and did the chores so she could focus on school no big deal at all well my dad put our dogs outside in the blistering heat and my sister tried to let my moms dog in because he couldnt breathe in the sun like that boston terrior well he got angry and said he would kill that dog and my sister started crying so he got even more mad and stormed after her and said he would snap both of our necks in a second and not feel bad about it so i went to our garage and sent my mom a text basically the equivalence of a goodbye because i thought we would be dead by the time she got home at that night from work well my mom and dad fought and she apologized to us and he swore he would get help well for a while he didnt do anything wrong and then he slowly started again my sister was gone so all he had to get angry at was me i refuse to help him with any projects because he gets angry and i have panic attacks and start trembling uncontrollably and you cant build a porch when you are trembling like crazy he also is unemployed right now due to being on disability from the va so he gets bored and he has this image in his mind that women are below him and that because im a daughter i should do his laundry and get his food and do his chores and he refuses to put his trash in the trashcan and leaves it all around the house im returning to a local university in a few months so im trying to count down the days he gets angry when my grandmother calls my mom and says he wishes she would disappear shes never done anything but tried to care for him i fell asleep the other day because im sick and he handed me this remote to the ac well i didnt know why he did that and neither did he so i sat it on the tissue box and it accidentally fell in no big deal except i woke up to him quiet yelling at my mom about where it was and i heard him tell her that he was going to beat me up and he was dead serious of course he has no clue what im talking about when i mentioned it to him while he was in a good mood today and then he started working outside this evening and was mad i was doing college preparations and couldnt stop and help him and he walked through the house holding a screwdriver and said he was going to stab us my mom and i as his idea of a joke i guess but i know he wasnt joking he always tries to hide it as a dark humor joke i guess but he also beats our dogs especially this one old dog of ours shes the sweetest little girl and my mom originally didnt want anymore animals after our last group died because it was too hard and he said we needed pets so he took my mom to visit this pig he knew my mom is softhearted and so we brought the baby pig home because he was being abused and now my mom is trapped with my dad i know thats why he did it too if she didnt have the animals she could leave him and be able to go to her moms house and he didnt want that you cant easily lift a full grown pig not a hog but pigs are still fat and heavy either way i just wish he could understand the pain hes put us through whether he meant to or not i understand he had a bad childhood and a hard life but now my sister and i are really messed up and not even medication can help i want to get out so bad but i cant bring myself to leave knowing my mom and animals could get hurt and my mom would actually try to hurt herself if she didnt have her animals i just hate that i have to live this way when i never asked to be born the hardest part of it all is the fact that i still love him and the thought of leaving him makes me sick because i still have hope that one day he might turn out to be the dad i always needed him to be anyways thanks for reading this i just needed somewhere to vent about this i guess without worrying my family or burdening my friends advice is welcome also i would like to add just because someone is mentally ill or has bipolar disorder that does not automatically mean they are abusive or toxic so no stigmatizing please

title is pretty self explanatory tonight my dad dropped a framed picture and it shattered all over the floor he reacted to this inconvenience in his usual rational way by screaming swearing throwing things across the room and threatening to kill himself he leaves and slams the door leaving us to clean up because for some reason its always our responsibility he comes back minutes later screaming at my mom for something completely irrelevant something to do with how she works too much and its not how a family should be ironic coming from him an abusive narcissist my mom doesnt make that much money and earns her salary from commission meaning she has to work a shit ton this argument had nothing to do with the original reason why he got so upset but it always somehow comes back to us he threatened to leave saying this is the last fking time im saying this otherwise dad will one day disappear and then screaming is that fking clear to my mom while shes cleaning his mess on her hands and knees i cant take this anymore its constant walking on egg shells and he knows he completely controls the family since he makes more money than my mom im an only child and cant live like this anymore but if i leave im scared hell eventually do something to my mom and i wont be here to stop him i cant even bother trying to help her because she will end up projecting her anger onto me instead of my dad ive been taking antidepressants that have seemed to help my depression but how am i supposed to get any better when im surrounded by this
so im f and i weigh kgs not overweight but ive been insecure of my weight since i could spell weight this summer i wanted a glow up i wanted to get skinny basically so i started starving myself ive done it before its just earlier i lied i ate and had a bad stomach but this time i did the mistake of telling them the truth my mother is the better parent shes a good mom but my dad i hadnt eaten for days and all of a sudden when im making coffee in the kitchen which also took so much self convincing that i should finally have something and i was going to make a cappuccino he came and started calling me a mf and how im mad and have i gone mad to not eat and i was submissive to it all until he started shouting on my mother which he always does for someone elses faults and i screamed that its not her fault and my grandfather came and told me how my dad loved me and it pained him to see me starving which ik was lie i went to my room and my father told me im a fcking bitch and not deserving of anything and if i get his anger up he will kill me after somethings my mom said to him he just came to hug me out of nowhere everytime he cusses me out to the point where i wont say such things to a rock let alone my daughter and he never says sorry but just hugs me and acts like nothing happened this time i didnt let him hug me and he threatened to beat the shit out of me again and left saying that how i wish he was dead and how we ruin his day and my mother told me i was disrespectful after that i went into the shower and screamed for half an hour and tw cut myself i feel like i didnt deserve all that and if he was concerned he could have just told me that it is important to eat and he cant see me hurting but he chose to call me a mf and how he didnt want to go through the trouble of getting me to a hospital im sorry i just needed to rent i feel like he will break me soon if hes like this ps basically he was having a bad day and ofc he takes it out on me
preface my ex wanted me to get an abortion for me to have a chance with him again and to hang out with me for this festival i lied to him saying i did it but then out of spite when he stood me up i told him i was pregnant and sent his parents the ultrasound pics first of all i want to say i am getting help i just work fulltime so its hard to find an available counselor when im working so this weekend was edc las vegas which is known as a huge music festival that happens in vegas my ex told me he would hang out with me all weekend if i acted properly im not going to lie i did take a little bit of mushrooms and he decided to hang out with me all weekend he said he promised he would see me then he stood up i told his mom and dad that im still pregnant sent them the ultrasound pictures and then i ask his friends where he was during the concert the day he stood me up i asked all of them and then i told him sorry i was acting crazy im pregnant with my ex and thats why im behaving like such then i was really mad that he stood me up but i didnt realize how mad i was when i told his parents i was pregnant and his friends so i told him meet me downstairs outside of your hotel because i deserve a kiss and a hug and he didnt really want to like im outside so we came down and then he just gave me a huge hug and then he yelled in my ear saying youre so fucking stupid you broke your promise you promised me you would do the abortion and that was the promise you made in order for me to hang out with you during this festival i fully regret telling him im still pregnant because he fully believed i did the abortion already so i shouldve just kept that a secret i just acted so emotionally crazy because he stood me up the day i then acted more crazy on monday or excuse me tuesday i called his work six times and then his boss called me saying if i keep harassing him he will call the police i really hope he doesnt do that reason to get a restraining order due to what i m doing i really like my ex and i would do anything to get him back but i know hes not going to stay with me forever so im keeping this kid and making sure it has the best life i can anyways i know i made some post on this sub reddit but i am not allowed to comment on my own post because i dont have enough comment karma so if you want to direct message me feel free i need people to talk to i have a discord if you want to add me i need support such as someone to talk to i really want to work it out with my ex but what should i do should i just leave him alone i went so crazy and i felt so bad for doing that i am slowly falling in love with the kid but i had so much fun with my ex i dont want to lose him you guys but with everything i did with me having no selfcontrol and no common sense and no respect for his privacy going on the verge of blackmailing him like im telling all his friends and family that pregnant so the people who say i should give it up for adoption this is my baby and im going to take good care of my baby do you guys think i blew it with my ex should i stop caring about my ex and just focus on the baby

ifam still living with my parents and it is slowly killing me this might be a long one so hold your pants i graduated highschool in and im working full time going to a trade school this september i have my own car i make sure my bills are paid etc yet my parents argument for not letting me leave is that i am not ready they say that my mental health is too bad and that i need to stay at home with them until im done school believe me that is the last thing i want long story short i was their golden child until i got to my senior year of hs and they started to lose respect for me all because i started smoking weed and going out a bit late anyway they had so much hope for me and even i feel that i let them down a bit because i had dropped out of uni and started doing the stuff they didnt like they held their standards for me too high and now i cant do anything right all i want is the support and respect from my parents for my decision to want to move out they still give me so many restrictions even though i am at the end of this year all i want is my own space and freedom to grow as a person and be able to adapt on my own yes i do struggle with my mental health but holding me in that house giving me a curfew of on a saturday and shaming me for smoking isnt helping me i really need advice for what to do thanks everyone
i f have been considering confronting my parents about all the things that theyve done because i think that it would be cathartic however im scared understandably so i was wondering if anyone here has had experiences confronting their parents and how you prepared yourselfhow it went
hi i am a f living in my family home with my boyfriend m i am writing this as i dont know if my feelings are valid and if so what i need to do but if not how i need to look at myself ive struggled my whole life with mental health and self esteem however even writing that makes me feel like a prick as i know others have it worse ever since i was little i remember being screamed and shouted at for the most simple things dropping orange juice not being able to get my maths right i just remember being teased and called names stupid a clown idiot sometimes even slapped a little thinking back to that even now i still feel cold and scared i would be moaned at for absolutely everything not wanting to wear dresses or go out or having my shoes up to loose i just remember being stressed all of the time i would hide behind buildings and trees to escape them as i had no where else to go at the age of to this day im still made fun of for having doing this i started developing weird fears because of the stress i was deeply traumatised by the idea of batteries running out or being late and the worst of all still to this day high ceilings i remember feeling very alone and i would cry to try and get love and affection to stop their anger anything to make it stop for a moment if the crying didnt work i would cry louder and louder but it always resulted in headaches and being left on the floor alone there was always these weird self image threats and issues if i misbehaved my mum would threaten to cut all of my hair off which is kinda ducked up as it taught me that beauty is measured by hair length also that i had to straighten my hair for events and that i shouldnt eat too much or ill get fat and ugly my parents would also search through my room every single moment in every single corner secretly putting spyware on my phones they would never tell me this but make suspicious comments and like jokes at topics id researched or messages i sent which made me very on edge and embarrassed my dad was quite emotionally up and down also you never knew what thing would spark what reaction or the classic you kids took up all my time and made me fat but when i was little he would play with me and talk to me lots which was great he was my safe space then when i hit around it all got much much much worse my dad would self admittedly not know how to talk to me and completely emotionally abandon me my mother would be always like a hot and cold firework i never felt comfortable around her trigger so i started looking to other adult figures and role models absorbing their personalities and style to an unhealthy degree most of these role models were men as the only female role model i had would critique herself and me in the most negative way so why would i want to be that so i started not eating lunch and binding my hips so that they wouldnt grow i didnt want to become that this got worse and worse and worse as the years went on becoming more depressed and finding new ways to destroy myself but i still felt this urge to have to act normal and keep up my grades my biggest focus was art as when i was little my mum would big me up and boast to all the other mums about how great my art was it made me feel important and if i wasnt the best in the school then i was any use not good enough as my weight dropped to stone at the age of i was so so so poorly i thought that it would be the cry for help that my parents needed much like my childhood crying it need to get louder until i was heard but it wasnt much like my crying it was just met with an even bigger and angrier rage my mum would hit me and call me a freak threatening to call for me to be taken to the mad house but weirdly never did call anyone she would secretly take pictures of my body to keep on her phone and compare photos of me then to the previous year she would grab me and belittle me really psychopathically calling me too weak to fight her and to just let her win as she tried to pin me down she would always tell me that she didnt do anything to deserve this and all of the other mums are talking about you and its embarrassing and the constant classic how do you think this makes me feel on one particular morning i remember it being so bad that i climbed out of my window and ran to school when she tried to lock me in i went upstairs to the mental health room for the first time adults didnt ask about my weight they just treated me like a real human and not a possessionfreak that was the first time i felt comfortable eating in months and months this continued on up until a few years ago i was still looking to role male models and was obsessed with the idea of having an older boyfriend to look after me and care for me its all i would dream about and write about but of course this lead to a lot of male mental and physical abuse and being with narcissistic men basically to sum this all up im moving out with my current partner into a house soon woo and whilst im still living at home i feel fucking miserable an anxious shell im a tattoo artist now and i cant focus on my drawings during the day in fear of the door swinging open and being screamed at for simple things my dad doesnt talk to me he gets all weird and jittery when im near my mother continues to belittle me and control everything i do but more from just a traumatised brain she makes me feel ugly for every tattoo that i get yet demands that i tattoo her whenever she feels like it all because she helped me get the job she ruined my st birthday as we share a birthday and it was her big day just everything is about how she feels i feel deeply on edge as uncomfortable around them both i feel like a shell of a human myself and i am absolutely sick and tired of it all im not perfect but fuck me im their child whenever i try to speak to her about anything that she doesnt agree with about herself or things that i want to do make me unhappy she just shouts louder than i can calmly explain should i ditch them when i move out should i stop contact she already said that she wants a key and to come over lots and to have a tracker on my phone she also got angry when i said no i just dont think that i can live my own life and feel free until shes dead or blocked honestly i just feel so tired and broken like a bird in a cage what should i do thank you
im f my dad was verbally and emotionally abusive my whole life hes not actively evil or anything i know but he has a talent for impulsively saying the very worst thing that a person could possibly say its figuratively almost like he has a demon inside him just waiting to take control and make him say the one thing that will get past a persons armor and hurt the worst when i was growing up his rage was an allconsuming fire hes said things that will haunt me until i die hes the voice of my inner critic always telling me how worthless i am even now anyway i grew up and moved out dad went on medication but it only barely keeps him from getting arrested for yelling at waitresses and such hes tried every dosage of everything under the sun under medical supervision he knows he was a terrible husband and father i know he recognizes he has a problem and is trying to change but still whenever i see him even as an adult i have to walk on eggshells whatever his deepdown intentions his words are still not the words of a kind man and i have very little self confidence at this point im very low contact with him we live minutes apart but i see him maybe times a year well today my mom they are divorced but still in contact texted to say that dad says he misses me and loves me i know its probably true i know he really does feel bad for what hes done to my mom my sister and i but i also know that he repeatedly told me growing up that having kids was the worst thing he ever did and he would unalive himself if my mom got pregnant again so theres that so right now im torn between feeling like im coldly taking out my bitterness on an old man who cant help himself and feeling like im doing the right thing by protecting myself i feel so guilty part of me wonders if i should offer to take him out to lunch to mend fences a bit but the thought just ties my stomach in knots because i know the conversation would just devolve into him saying something terrible i dont know where im going with this maybe im just venting and trying to work through things thank you for listening
im years old i just completely cut off contact with my parents today and while i know that it is probably for the best i feel so guilty and sad and well mostly just really sad i miss the people that they could have been to me my mom has had a really hard life she is horrible to me and extremely manipulative but i also feel so sad for her i love her and i want to be able to be there for her but thats also not my job i guess im the child for context i moved out when i was i havent been on good terms with my parents probably since i was ive cut off contact with them once before a few years ago but we reconnected after i had a medical emergency for a while like a month lol i really did think things were better that maybe they had changed and they do love me but since then we have gotten in some really nasty arguments especially with my dad they have made it very clear that they hate everything i am and everything i care about and stand for they take every opportunity to insult and belittle me and they have both returned to their manipulative narcissistic habits still i was willing to put up with it and just have sort of limited contact the thing that changed recently was that they stopped doing the bare minimum to care for my continued survival they refused to cosign my lease to ensure that i would have a place to live for the next year i havent relied on them financially since i moved out all i really have needed from them is to fill out the fafsa form for student loans and to cosign my leases so i can have a place to live i work i have an excellent credit score and i have never missed a rent payment but because i dont make x rent landlords still require a cosigner anyway so they said because they dont approve of my lifestyle they wont cosign i found a different cosigner so that is okay so i sent them a message basically saying that they cannot really be considered parents as they dont fulfill any parental responsibilities towards me and they clearly do not like me as a person so there is no reason to continue having a relationship then i blocked them but ive been crying about it literally for hours it really hurts i dont know what else i could have done i know this really hurt my mom especially tldr i blocked my parents am sad and guilty about it

for some back story my sister f was with her baby dad m for almost years he was extremely controlling and abusive to her in every way it took her getting pregnant and having her baby my niece to finally have the strength to leave him because she needed to protect her baby when she was home from the hospital he couldnt handle her crying as a newborn he came into the bedroom screaming to shut the baby up he pulled out a gun and pointed it at my newborn niece and then to his own head that was when my sister knew she had to get away from himthe next day she came to my family for help and we moved her out she got a protective order against him and they had a really nasty case i court against each other cps came to interview her and i was there for support and it was the first time i had seen my sister cry in over a decade recounting to the cps what he did to her in court he lied so much about my sister and he got away with all of it because the law protects him as a parent too and there wasnt enough evidence that same cps worker high fived the dad after court that day years later and multiple court hearing later as his tactic of draining our family of money he continues to be the same person he always was my niece is much older now and able to vocalize his actions she says that he grabs her arm out of no where and twists it that he grounds her for lying about brushing her hair or showering when she says she is telling the truth so he locks her in her room for hours she says he tells her she is fat she is actually very very skinny and that her teeth are crooked and ugly she has had many breakdowns before school because of this because he has messed up her self esteem so bad she said he tickles her out of no where so hard that it hurts and it makes her cry and now yesterday when she came back from her dads she said he pushed her really hard when she was climbing into the car because she was taking too long and she hit the top of her head really hard she still had a bump on her head and then woke up this morning with very blurry vision so we took her to urgent care immediately and got her checked out and a cat scan that we are still waiting for the results for please any advice on what we can do we are terrified of what he will do to punish her if we dont succeed in getting the law to protect her after so many attempts already if we file a police report what will he do if he still gets regular custody he is about to have her for weeks for the start of summer it would be too long to share how much more there is to this case but he has gotten away with everything he has ever done im so scared that he will kidnap her or punish her for telling us or come up with another lie to take my sister to court as retaliation like hes done before

i need some advice from my fellow netizens here im also partly venting as my mental health has gone to the dump in light of recent events i would like to know whether its a good idea to move out of my home for better context i stay in an indian household and have been raised by an abusive parent ive been subjected to a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my dad during my childhood i dont have any fond memories of good times associated with him the abuse became emotional after i grew up and started fighting back and hit a peak in i was studying for my masters degree at the time i feel like i have spent a large chunk of my life just trying to undo the damage and step away from a cycle of hatred ive taken help in the form of therapy after a lot of work i came to a position where i forgave him things seemed to be tolerable for a while it seemed like he was changing as a person but the truth of the matter is that he lies constantly ive become slightly more confrontational over the years heres the problem recently he went on an outburst bringing up everything from our past he told me how ashamed he was of me he also had issues with me going to therapy and helping myself he told me that whatever i have done till now amounts to nothing i dont have a mainstream career im an entrepreneur who runs a media and marketing agency i feel like its struggling though we operate with a profit month on month only barely unfortunately the company that funded my start up invested is connected to my dad so we work on the same floor since the pandemic ive chosen to stay with my family i can survive living by myself financially maintain my current lifestyle by saving approx of my salary financially it makes more sense to stay at home as i save approx of my salary and ive saved enough money to look after myself for the next years alone my confidence levels are at one of my lowest so far im feeling useless and hopeless about the future dont know what to do next i fear that ill end up on the streets it feels like this person is keeping my family hostage by using the fact that he is the main provider for my family i want to look after my mom and sister as well in the future but all family members associated with him end up miserable unhappy and poor if i stay back i would be there to provide support for my mom and sister
i wish they said they loved me and meant it i wish they didnt abuse me for just existing as a disabled person i wish they didnt treat the things i asked them to do as monumental tasks that are such big inconveniences i wish they didnt treat me like im stupid and cant take care of myself as if i havent been doing that for years on top of taking care of them i wish it didnt take five minutes alone with them to turn a good day into an emotional spiral i wish they didnt make me wish harm on them for making me feel so bad i wish i didnt wish one of us were dead i wish i didnt have to run away from support and a stable home in order survive because the emotional abuse is taking that much of a toll i wish they gave me credit for how hard it is to exist like this as it is i wish they acknowledged my struggling instead of acting like im putting more on their shoulders for just existing i wish i didnt feel like a burden i wish i didnt feel like killing myself i wish i didnt feel so depressed i wish i could talk to them about my feelings with them saying no you dont feel that way or getting defensive or saying everyones tired i wish things were different i wish they were different i wish they didnt make me cry so much i wish they didnt make it hard to cry i wish they had remorse
abusive dad enabling mom i was suggested to post here so here it goes myy oldest brother left home hi a long long time ago my oldest half sister left home due to my abusive dad things gotten better over time with him but not entirely my next oldest sister left home and joined the military but sides with him kinda thing so i dont think he was the reason she left home entirely i left home years ago due to my dad my oldest brother just recently left home in october due to my dad that leaves my youngest brother left living with him and my mom what the fuck is happening my oldest brother says that he hoped that him leaving too will result in my dad noticing that hes been the problem but it doesnt seem like it what can this say about you as a parent with maybe of your kids leave you how can a mom feel she used to watch us get in fights and beat on by him and do nothing i was told by my oldest sister he used to abuse our mom but i was really young and remember my mom and my siblings and i going to a womens shelter for a few days to get away from him but what i honestly cant really wrap my head around whats wrong with my dad or why my mom sits and watches or why this isnt talked about amongst me and my siblings idk
my dad has always been verbally abusive hes called me all the names under the sun he threatens to destroy and break my things and freaks out if i move or touch things that are things for everyone to use in the house my mum doesnt do much to help me as shes always working during the week and im left at home with him as hes unemployed and has been my whole life hes an abusive control freak and idk what to do i suffer with extreme mental health issues and am struggling to get a job and he bullys me for not having a job when he literally doesnt have one and im trying to get one and have for a little while having literally just finished university im not sure what to do because even at my boyfriends house his mum is a control freak psycho any advice i would be greatful for im not in a great place at the moment
for context i got my period weeks after my th birthday and iv always had endometriosis so iv always had a pretty heavy flow but my mom would only buy me light and regular pads so i would go thru them pretty often about pad an hour she never really educated me about periods just that its when a woman goes through puberty and it makes your stomach hurt and you bleed that was it so i didnt know to ask for thicker pads i didnt know thicker existed i just assumed shed buy me what i needed but one day i asked for more pads bc i ran out and she got really upset with me saying shes seen all the pads in the trash and im going thru them to fast i explained that they were full and after hrs they wouldnt aborb anymore blood it would get on my pants and underwear and u could clearly see that they were soaked all the way thru she just huffed at me and said they should last hrs per pad and left and after a while came back with a box of tampons for also a little more context my mom also has very bad endometriosis but also only uses tampons never pads and had always made fun of me for wearing padsshe said i needed to figure out how to use them bc shes not buying pads anymore since i was wasting them and to read the back of the box and just figure it out if i didnt wanna bleed on myselfi kept trying to use them but i was barly i had an extremely thick hymen that it just wouldnt go thru and they just hurt so badly so for a while i just had to use them long ways or stuff toilet paper in my underwear but i had a few nice friends at school that would give me pads and i found out a specific bathroom at the school i was in always had period products and so for months i just did that and never asked her again am i wrong was this abuse shes always been very strange about my period and how it could never be as bad as her and im just so so lucky even tho i also hav endometriosis i just stage ands shes stage shes forced me to free bleed several times when i was young aswell
what a huge relief already wow if you need context im done after the last conversation weve had i realized im done living on survival mode when he is home the convo boils down to this me its horrible to fear my own dad to feel anxious when youre around and feeling like im walking on eggshells him thats on you for living in the past dont provoque me then that last part showed me finally how little he undertsands about this and how unwilling he is to even consider that he is damaging i opened up when telling him what i wrote above my throat was in a knot it was hard to talk tears i tried communicating it in many ways the fact that he responded the way he did was the last straw maybe before i just didnt want to acknowledge it on a subconscious level even but now im unable to avoid it the conclusion is clear domestic abuse im limiting my contact with him to the bare minimum that is whats needed to live stuff around the house logistics things involving the other family members thats it im done trying to foster a warm father son relationship no fucking discussing the champions league final yes ive seen the match you too ok cool yeah aha ok goes to another room that and therapy i finally understand ive been living in the shadow of fear of fearing my own fucking dad and living in a state of survival for years a threat in our own home i see that ive diminished myself already looking for psychologists do you recommend a specific specialization im thinking one experienced in domestic violence ive heard great things about somatic stuff eye movement that kind of thing in my view the body does keep the score and i can sometimes feel it even god so many years of wondering why cant i socialize normally why do i feel so insecure etc etc all the while knowing deep down that my true self is not like that in any way and for anybody that might need to hear this abusers can love too it doesnt have to feel contradicting to cut them off from your life even when you see through their pain and know they love you even if theyve dropped everything in their lives to help you when you needed it it doesnt make you owe anything to them if they are true family they will help you no matter the circumstances or the years you have been ignoring them
idk if this is the right subreddit for this and i wont go into too much detail about the abuse my mother has put me through but its both physical and mental though i would say mostly mental i have dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past to the point where i even tried to actually kill myself and im right now and currently finishing up my exams i want to leave this house i genuinely cant do this anymore i dont know why im getting yelled at and literally pushed onto the floor over forgetting to fold clothes she has kicked me out once a few years ago over me not dusting off the shelves which then i ended up apologising and she reluctantly accepted and let me come back and those are a few things she has done i really just dont know what to do idk where to go or what to do in general idk how to get a job its not like they teach that shit in school i cant even let alone find a place thats hiring to begin with and even if i do i just need to get out of this house i dont wanna see my mom for the past years i was hoping a car would hit her i feel no love for her i stopped a long time ago i couldnt care about what happens to her
this is my first ever post on here but i need to vent because i cant tell anyone this because i dont want her to know im and through circumstances out of my control im still living at home my parents have never been the most emotionally supportive or open people while i was growing up in fact for the first time this year they told us about how they want us to open up to them emotionally but i dont feel comfortable doing so two weeks ago l my boyfriend of years broke up with me out of nowhere and ive been a mess mentally and emotionally this has obviously translated to me not being present emotionally and being absent minded luckily i didnt have any classes that week so i spent the whole week in my room also trying to study im in university and about to start exams and i let it get messy she eventually came into my room and started berating me about how messy my room is and how disgusting i am then she called all my relatives to tell them about how ungrateful i am for not being able to do something as simple as keeping my room clean then later on she asked me about why i seem so depressed and i told her about being broken up with and she basically told me to move on because he didnt matter hes a foreigner then today she asked me to get some fruit for her and i got a naartjie which i would normally peel but all the trash had been taken out so i waited till we got outside to peel it i put the naartjie in the car to peel and she just took it an ld threw it at my head without because it hadnt been peeled yet then she got mad that her car hadnt been cleaned shes the only one who uses that car and she didnt tell us that there are things in the car and then she went on a minute rant about how ungrateful i am and how i cant seem to do anything right and how my age mates are in their own houses and how she did mule a favour by raising me and buying me nice things i genuinely think she hates me and resents the fact that im still living at home its not like i want to i literally dont have a choice
my mum and dad split around a year ago and even though it was bad before its getting worse over this time it has become apparent to me that it was always our dad taking care of us me my sister and my two younger brothers and never our mum my grandparents on my mums side are urging me to go to a counsellor at school but i dont know if what she is doing is really that bad our youngest brother has asd autism he is diagnosed and is nonverbal me and my other brother are likely autistic too but she has no intention of getting either of us diagnosed what concerns my nan is that she says our mum is neglecting us medically i told her that one of the last times i had been to a doctor was when i was that was because my mother thought i had gout due to me complaining of pain very often we went for one appointment had a blood test and she had never taken me back despite getting results that it wasnt gout due to a lack of what causes it in my bloodstream after a lot of research i believe i have fibromyalgia or something simular as i relate to many of its symptoms my pain has not gotten better and she has made no moves to help me with this she will now laugh it off when i complain of pain even though im sure she believes me it is getting very hard to deal with which is what made me mention it to my grandparents in the first place my right ankle will also lock up if i walk for mins what i did not mention is that i have had thoughts of ending it because i dont think i can live like this but every time my mum laughs it off i cant help but feel that maybe im overreacting we talked more me my sister and my nan and my sister who hasnt lived with us for months mentioned other things since our parents seperated it has been me sister and brother cleaning the entire house i will be called downstairs no matter how much my body ached to open the door for a cat often while she is sitting in an armchair on her phone she my mum said because we are younger we can do more despite her adopting all four of our cats she will never feed them it is always me i will be called down to clean the kitchen the lounge every mess her and make i am made to clean it she will say to her friends she only had us to do her work and make her rich and though everyone takes it as a joke i dont think it is my sister moved out because she was doing this work too and was still expected to pay board to my mother she will ignore us if we say anything to her and if we continue to try she will yell at us has been yelled at for telling our mother that s seatbelt had been unbuckled i remember my mum threatening to throw a kitchen knife at me if i didnt shut up she does not remember this and when i insisted on her saying that to me she said she probably didnt mean it anyway i dont know why but that really sticks with me i am expected to look after whenever she needs me too i likely have asd and to be well emotionally i need to prepare myself for it i have received no notice before just a text she was going for a coffee and that was home she says i can say no any time but i have once since i was sick and she yelled at me for being so selfish she wanted to take out for a dinner somewhere even though there is food at home most of the time she is never there for us emotionally it doesnt effect me so much im old enough to be independent but she does not pay frequent attention to i believe this is a reason for his anger issues he can not talk out his emotions and if he attempts too he will be yelled at as much as i wish to be i am not mentally well enough to help him im sorry if this is a mess im just typing this to try and earn the courage to talk to a counsellor i have no clue how it works and im scared of it does anyone have anything to help with a counselling session
my mother is once again talking about killing herself killing us leaving the house ect and im seriously considering running away she says she loves us she does nice things but then when we dont listen to her for a bit too long she decides its okay to leave permanent scars and make us suicidal should we run away

my dad used to hate me so much and would hit me and get into my face almost every day and now that i am taking about moving out and cutting him out of my life now he is saying that he thinks that i will turn out the best compared to my siblings and tells me that i cant trust any of them and also tells me that i cant even trust my friends enough to move in with anyone like i feel like he is trying to be manipulative instead of hitting to get what he wants
the answer might be obvious to some of yall but hear me out i female have had a rough childhood always abused and screamed at i am convinced my mom actually hates me a few years back when i was or my step dad beat me with his belt multiple hits as i cried in the corner of my walls through the whole thing i only yelled for my mom to help me i knew she was nearby my yells should have definitely reached her after he stopped and walked away while cussing at me i cried for minutes and then went to go find her to see why she didnt come i couldnt believe what i saw she was on the couch the whole time smiling and laughing while talking to her friend i asked her why she didnt help me she acted confused as if it was meant to happen to me she then said i deserved it for being bad and to go away i stood there with my puffy red eyes tears dripping down and thats when it hit me i now knew she definitely would trade me for anything that day as years passed by things turned worse one thing good happened though i got stronger from all the abuse and fought back one thing i cant handle is her screams she hurts me we fought a lot throughout the years she always guilt trip me and acted like a victim when my step dad gets involved even when she started or hurt me more she would always say i hurt her more one time she even drew blood on my skin with her own nails then laughed it off and walked away i pretty much hate her every move when she breathes when she laughes when she walks etc a lot worse happened but today ive had enough my friend came over unexpected and i was so happy we hung out and she excused herself to the restroom the amount of shame i felt when she told me what happened in indescribable she said she saw bloody undies on the ground i looked at it and gagged no one should be ashamed to have their period but this was just disgusting and shameless i told my friend to kindly leave and that i need to speak to my mother when i came in my moms rooms she started yelling at me she said why would you let her see or this is all your fault i was so confused and asked her what shes talking about she said i let my friend see her underwear and kept blaming me ive had enough and told her that shes unhygienic and disgusting it sucks living with her and having to shower everyday because just the thought of her makes me feel the need to shower i said more but i dont wanna get into it my step dad came home and yelled at me wouldnt get out of my room he kept getting close to me but i didnt want to get harmed so i just told me to please get out while crying and guess what he still wouldnt i pushed him out and shut my door fast as he pounded on it i cried out for him to go away after an hour of my arms being sore from holding my door so that he couldnt come in i just cried while sitting on the floor i heard my mom laughing and telling him that he put up a great fight i am sad miserable even i have one job that doesnt pay well along with school to pay attention to im trying to graduate early and im almost in a few months why am i trying to graduate early you ask well i have this friend in another state whos dad is a college professor he said he can get me into my dream college fast if i come to his state i believe him because he did it before except i had to turn it down because i had other plans in the past that didnt involve going to college but now i know that college is my only freedom escape and future i have dollars saved up so far i need enough to buy a flight and then rent an apartment i hate to ask anyone for help but my cashapp is iambm and every cent helps if anyone wants updates let me know
ive been feeling not so great in the past couple days because of my periods and i was making dinner with mom but because the speaker from the oven is broken it doesnt make a noise besides a short tick so i cant hear it if im not in the kitchen close by and i was not feeling great and wanted to sit for a bit waiting for the food to cook but i got distracted and forgot what time it was and i didnt hear the sound from the oven so i eneded up burning the dinner for whole family and when my dad smelled the burning he got so mad and yelled at me to go stand in my corner and i was so tired and not feeling great so i asked him im really sorry but if i can maybe push the punishment to later but he didnt want to hear me he was like no way go stand now nose in the corner and skirt up do i need to start counting i asked him again if he can go easy on me because of the period and because its more embarrassing and my mom hopped in and said oh honey its not your fault you are on your periods dont be embarrassed you should have been more careful especially we all already know that you get too hot in the head during your time of the month then she also told me to listen to my dad because i already know the consequences and didnt pay attention and i had to stand in the corner like that while my dad my little brother and mom ate dinner looking at me and making fun of me im sorry for venting but i dont know how to feel even a little bit better besides venting a bit
hi guys i just found this subreddit i just had another fight with my mom and feel like i need some advice so ill share a bit of my story so growing up my mom has always been really angry and quick to set off she yelled and screamed a lot stomped slammed doors the whole thing she often times hit me shoved me etc the only thing she never did was hit me with a closed fist i have a little sister who is only years younger than me and i have always felt like my parents treated her a lot better than me they gave her pretty much everything she wanted even if it was at my expense they constantly tooktake her side in arguments and let her get away with a lot more than i ever did so ill get to what todays argument was about i am a full time college student and my parents are helping me out with college i told them when i started college that when i had my car on campus i would be getting a job so that i could pay them back i just got home for summer break and have not had the chance to look for a job yet because i wanted a week to relax without having to think of school or work my mom this entire past week has been making snide comments about how i still havent found a job and basically been making me feel bad for wanting some time to relax and claiming that everyone else had already found jobs so me and my sister got in an argument and my mom thought it was best to t to address it so she asked for my sisters side and then she asked for mine where i told her what happened and then she said but is that really what happened i know you trying to imply that i am a liar so i obviously got mad and she asked well what should we do to resolve this situation and i mistakenly mentioned that i was thinking about moving in with my boyfriend for the summer this sent her into a spiral where she told me that she was going to unsign her part in my lease for next year she also brought up how i was apparently crazy because i threatened to call the police on her one time then she claimed well obviously i am just a horrible abusive mother which i have never said she claims that i constantly being up what she used to do to me when i was little and claims that none of it is true so then i tried to fake apologize just so that we could have some normalcy but then she told me that i have apparently been breaking her down my entire life and have always told her that she was horrible parent and always compared her to other peoples parents when growing up she was the one who used to compare me to other peoples kids she claimed that she was done with me breaking her down and that i was apparently th abusive one now i am left questioning if thats really true or not or if im being gaslit i feel like im telling myself im being gaslit even though im not so i can not take the blame for it but thats something my mom tells me so i am just really not sure if any of it is real i mean theres no chance i could just come out of the womb and start manipulating everyone around me right there has to be a reason why i ended up like this i feel like its all my fault so am i being gaslit
i dont know whether i should write these things down or not i feel very hopeless and depressed my life seems so bleak and nothing i can do will change that i just want to be freefree of pain free of stress and free of abuse everything that i have gone through must have meaning because if it doesnt then i might just end it all i dont know why she acts this way i did not force her to give birth to me she was the one who decided it even my own father was against me being born not because he didnt want me but because he knew how messed up she was he wanted to leave but couldnt because of me poor him i pity my father so much if i wasnt born maybe he could have left this abusive relationship he could have been free but i am a selfish person and to be honest i am glad that he didnt leave because if he had left i would have probably been sold off to someone to get married even now she threatens me with it saying that she could make someone kidnap me and force me to become their wife im only by the way so imagine that happening it isnt that uncommon in my culture in fact most of my sisters got married that way and they never left because of honor but they thought that this was the only way to escape the monsterfrom one abusive household to another my poor sisters i also pity them my father is their stepfather and although he wanted to be involved in their lives she never let that happen guess why because she was jealous of her own children one of my sisters even ran away from home and got married to someone much older than her because she couldnt take it anymore her whole life got ruined because of it and now she does the same thing to me she accuses me of sleeping with my own father since i became a teenager my virginity has always been in question i dont even do anything for her to suspect something like that she even says herself that none of my peers would sleep with me so i probably try to do it with my own bloodrelated father its sickening i dont even want to talk about physical abuse thats just my daily routine now i remember being beaten with a wooden stick for minutes straight because i didnt wait for her to pick me up from school i was nine or ten i didnt know any better and our house is minutes away walking distance one time she made me bleed from my head and i had to calm her down and apologize for making her hurt me i dont know what to do anymore my arms are full of scars and i am ashamed of showing them when my friends ask i say they are gifts from my mother today she threw me out of the house if it wasnt for my dad i would have become homeless i am just so tired i want to end it all
tomorrow maybe tonight if you go on facebook and search miles robertson should be a blank profile right there on my fake profile is a long text
i just want her to hug me to tell me everythings gonna be okay but ive got nothing no one
i just need to vent and dont know who to vent to so sorry for the super long dramatic post i guess im sharing my story in case it makes someone feel less alone because im hoping to feel that way i guess im also hoping for advice growing up my father was physically emotionally verbally abusive the physical stuff was only when i was very young it fizzled out as i grew up but the other stuff was so brutal the general overview was that i was the scapegoat from a very early age my older brother had some special needs emotional issues so a lot of my parents energy went to him and my younger sister was the baby of the family the favorite often leaving me on the outskirts any attention i did get was purely negative i think as a child i harbored some resentment towards the two of them as unfair as it is i know as an adult it wasnt their fault and i truly feel ive moved past it however the effects of only ever experiencing negative attention from my parents are horrible i was taught at such a young age that i was bad that there was something truly devastatingly wrong with me and therefore i caused all of the tension and fighting in the house my father had a hard day at work it was my fault when he took it out on everyone my siblings got in a fight it was my fault for causing the bad moods if i retaliated while being attacked physically or verbally it was viewed as an isolated incident an uncalled for uncontrollable temper when i did mess up or misstep it only made it worse everyone else was infallible while my mistakes were ammunition weaponized as evidence i remember knowing something was wrong but not having the language for it i was too young to understand and by the time i got older and had the capacity to communicate what was happening to me the manipulation ran so deep that i didnt think words like abuse applied to my situation i so deeply believed that i was bad and terrible and every other horrible thing they called me that i thought it was my fault the physical stuff had subsided so isnt it my fault that they yell i figured out how to keep myself safe eventually stay out of the way stay in your room dont make noise dont cross their paths dont have any wants or needs if you overhear slamming or yelling hold your breath make yourself smaller pray it subsides before they remember youre there it didnt always work but i did my best the only way i got through was counting down the years until i finished high school and i could get out though sometimes that number provided more dismay than comfort it wasnt until i graduated high school that i realized what it was my parents split up at the end of my senior year and it was the first time i heard someone else use the word my mother i remember when the word abuse passed her lips some part of me found it to be obvious another part of me was destroyed nothing was the same after that i had already experienced such a tumultuous upbringing and now i had to reexperience it under the lens of abuse it was like it happened twice the first year was really strange my father was overly nice overly welcoming trying to forge a connection wed never had my mother was apologetic trying to rebuild something that never was my father was afraid id testify and my mother i suppose she felt guilty for never stepping in i dont know what i felt confused angry hurt i knew my parents had been strict and unkind but downright abusive it made sense but i didnt want it to my anxiety was really bad with my father out of the house all of my repressed memories started coming back to me i was having nightmares every night i started having panic attacks i couldnt eat couldnt sleep every minute awake was spent in an anxiety attack with the occasional panic attack and every minute asleep was filled with nightmares this went on for about two months i lost about pounds this was also during quarantine so my family was stuck at home together my mother and i didnt have the kind of relationship where we could talk to one another so she assumed i was completely fine my siblings were always welcome to come to her so she knew they were having a hard time with it so her attention and compassion went to them when i started having panic attacks i talked to her hoping for some kind of help or support instead i was brushed off summer fall of that year was when things started to deteriorate once more my mother was angry and i was the recipient every word that left her mouth about me was negative whether it was to me or to someone else my mere presence and existence were enough to set her off just like as a child it was all on me everyones anger everyones moods all of the fighting and yelling it was all on me again but i was angry too i had just realized my father had abused me my entire life and that my mother had stood by while it happened not only that but she was a participant my whole childhood i know its not fair to blame her if my father was like that with my siblings and i i can only imagine what else was going on but i was a child she was an adult as a woman i have so much empathy for her as her child i didnt know how to forgive her especially when she was continuing the cycle even after my dad left the year i was was filled with constant anger and flights i always had to be on guard ready for anything her threatening to kick me out was nothing new but now that i was old enough to be on my own it felt so much more real it also felt so unjustified id yell back when i was being yelled at i was bad about keeping up with my chores but there wasnt a single instance that felt worthy of throwing me aside yet she held shelter and stability over my head every chance she got i was attending community college classes and working part time saving up as much as i could in case she followed through we lost our house that year moved to an apartment tensions only grew worse my mom was more stressed out than ever and i was more of a target than ever i worked two jobs attended classes i was never home never asked for anything paid for all of my own things never engaged with her and yet i was when it finally happened after years of being threatened with it i was a semester away from finishing my degree still working two jobs still staying out of the way my older brother and i were told my mother and sister were moving at the end of the week and we were not welcome to join the lease on our current apartment ended in two months and we were welcome to stay if we covered the bills but after that we were on our own no help my brother was two years into a full time job tens of thousands of dollars saved away while still obviously a horrible situation hed be okay but me i know is an adult but i was still in school yes i worked two jobs but they were still part time and almost all of my income was spent on school gas groceries and bills at this point i was a few months into no contact with my father when my mother told me this we didnt speak for months we eventually got back in touch but its not a proper connection the hardest part was that i was alone there was no family i could stay with no friends able to take me in no one to help me find a place or help me understand my finances and my options the tuition for my last semester of school was i would be student teaching in the mornings and working all afternoon and weekends id have to make enough money to fully cover all of my bills and necessities while spending hours a week student teaching completely unpaid on top of all of my other classes i didnt have much in savings since i

keep going that being said its also so difficult seeing people my age close to their families having a home and people to go back to getting to graduate college supported by loved ones financially or otherwise only just now starting their adult lives its hard a better person would be happy for them and deep down i am but im also so jealous i dont know if ill ever get to finish my degree i dont want to take out loans with no way to pay them back yes im working three jobs but the cost of living is so immense just about every cent goes to bills rent and necessities i dont see a way out but i

act like you choose to be born to psychopaths oh yes karen when i was just chilling in the void i asked god to send me to earth so i could experience true pain and torture because i wanted to spend my time on earth as a depressed human wanting to die because when i was in the void i was a closet masochist and i specifically choose a family of psychopathic odinists to make me realize my true worth
i grew up in a very abusive household physically sexually and mentally the physical and sexual was from my father and the mental was my mother my mother enabled my father my whole life so recently i moved in with my grandmother who is my mothers mom i adore my grandmother my mother was and is very jealous of my relationship with my grandmother so i didnt tell my mother i moved in with my grandma and recently my mom sent me a message hey just want to let you know i find it very shitty to find out my daughter lives in from someone else and she blocked me on facebook but no where else and idk why her blocking me made me have these emotions ive never experienced before and its hard to deal with them mind you my mother never cursed and she made it a big deal when i blocked her on facebook last year idk i feel she trying to play some mind game with me she hasnt called or texted her mother i believe she is afraid to because she doesnt know what ive told her mother about what she allowed to happen in that household idk i needed to vent
my mom was very abusive to me mentally physically and emotionally and i havent spoken to her for months after i moved l today she sent me this message should i forgive her and respond or leave it be i personally dont believe she has changed because shes still abusive to my sisters below is the message good morning it has been awhile since we last spoke and i am reaching out because as the parent i should have not given up when you didnt continue to reach out i do know that as my youngest daughter it given me pain to know that i am not in the process of you growing into a teenager and also in to womanhood and that i should and would like to be apart of that process i would like to know no matter how hurtful it is what it is have done to you so that in hopes i can fix it or work or work on it to be better i understand you have a new life and environment with your dad and i understand and respect that but i would also like for you to acknowledge and understand and accept me as the person who gave you life and really does love youi dont do things right and i dont at times have any answers but what i can know is that i love my girls and i hope that they love me and i need them and would love to always be apart of them i hope we can make amends as to what the root of the issue is and fix it and move on with live and sincerity but if you choose not to then at least tell me why i love you
i f have insomnia it gets so bad at nights that id just lay in my bed overthinking things that usually leaves me to question lots of things and i end up spiraling and crying my mother f and father m have bought me medication for this i stopped using it a while ago due to it not working i asked for a higher dosage but my parents refused saying that if the house began to burn down i wouldnt wake up intime to run one night after a full day of netball from am pm i had around two hours sleep note im not allowed coffee or any caffeine to wake up im expected to be able to jump out of bed with a lot of energy i woke up the next morning to my father yelling at me to get up i had dark eyebags and bloodshot eyes i looked like the walking dead this was on sunday as well so i really wanted to try and sleep a bit more sundays are the days that my grandparents sometimes come over to take us to the early morning mass my grandparents are religious even pestering my parents to send me and my other siblings to catholic schools even though my parents arent religious anyway i basically wasnt feeling okay and i told my father this but he ignored me saying that i should do it for my grandparents since they dont have long to live and we should make them happy while we can i understand this but my mental health had already been declining with the pile of schoolwork and my friends fighting and having bad home lives i finally got up from my bed and while my siblings were all dressed and ready to go i was on the verge of tears i kept telling him that i didnt want to go that i was too tired and he kept saying he didnt care i got dressed anyway and while i was looking for socks he kept saying things like you had all morning to get dressed and i already yelled at you to wake up and get dressed this is your own fault i was already really sick of it and i kept talking back eventually my father got fed up with this and got as physically close as possible before yelling at me i was terrified its not a nice experience to see your father right up in your face teeth bared like a feral animal and yelling at me that this is his house and i have to listen to him while i lived there he didnt physically hurt me but i was scared he would i snapped at this and shoved him away i told him to get the fck away from me before staggering into my grandparents car sobbing my father looked as if he was going to hurt me but my mother stopped him saying i was only a child i spent the rest of mass trying not to cry dreading when i got back when i did my parents both came to the decision that i was disrespectful and was setting a bad example for my younger siblings who might copy what i did my punishment sleeping in the laundry until my parents said and six months doing everyones chores we live in a household where there are seven people not including any visitors and two dogs and that i was grounded until they decided to every night before i go to sleep i have to clean the dirty laundry which stores bags shoes and dirty clothes after all the chores i had to do and set up a bed there that i have to pack up every day when i wake up

hello i am and planning on cutting of my abusive family very soon it has been an ongoing plan for about years but they found out about it about a year ago and most of my plans fell through things have come to a head here and i need to leave for my own safety and wellbeing to say im terrified is an understatement and i am not sure what to do i have cash saved up as well as a job where i am putting some of my paycheck into a secret account i also have a place to stay when i leave where i would be treated like one of their kids but theyre not rich and i would feel terrible mooching off of their money when i stay there my question is what are the big adult things my car phone bill and credit card are all under my parents name i assumed wouldnt be able to bring my credit cards or car but wjat about my phone an my car to get to work everyday i also do not have access to my passport or social security card i just have photos of it i need to work out the logistics of everything before i leave tldr super financially dependent on my family but needs to leave yesterday what big scary adult things do i need to essentially start a new life
normally my mom is a nice person to me but sometimes she gets really mad just now i was telling her i was too tired to go on a walk to a park but she was yelling at me a lot telling me to go and i just snapped ive never been able to control my emotions well so i yelled back and she slapped my arm she also told me that were not going on a trip again other times ive been thinking about her possibly being abusive are every time she threatened to leave the house and not come back when i was way younger and how often she threatens to send me to a mainstream school im autistic and i go to an autism special school its conflicting because shes usually lovely to me its just sometimes she goes too far is she abusive or am i overthinking it my arm hurts but she rarely hits me so im not sure the things she says can feel like guilt tripping but im not sure at all can someone help
i hate when my parents make me stand in the corner it makes me feel so small and it makes me feel like a child and it is embarrassing but whenever i slightly mess up my dads first response is go stand in your corner and show me how silly you are so i waited until he was in a good mood and i walked up to him and asked could you maybe consider not sending me into the corner since im growing up maybe i could learn the same being sent to my room then he was like do you think you know better than me and i knew i messed up he then right away said go stand in your corner and show me how silly you are then i had to go there with my nose in the corner and my dress up and everything then he was like if you are so smart and better than me why are you standing here like a silly girl then he called for my mom and asked if im on my period because im acting irrational then he made me stand there for so long and i felt so little and mortified again later mom came and told me maybe you should act better then you wouldnt have to go to the corner dont talk like that to your father it feels so humiliating but i cant help myself
me f have been scared of my dad since i was everytime i would do something wrong he would strip me completely naked and spank me with a belt now that im older he took the door for my room and my closet the worst one was he tought me and my sister y had been involved with a guy so he made has stand completely naked in front of a big part of our family until we admitted something we didnt do
i have tried to understand dynamics if the role of the person who constantly goes up and down in moods between rejection and demanding attention the person who cant control their anger who is frustrated by people expressing their own actual wants and needs if it isnt what they want selfish and controlling who manipulates people with threats of suicide calls everyone names has been violent will destroy your things etc is the victim and the scapegoat then absolutely fuck that and i do not agree theres a difference between being so intensely selfish that you make everything about yourself and claim youre actually a supreme victim vs being the scapegoat this person thinks everyone is abusing them when no one is and when they dont get their way they couldnt give a shit about their parents or siblings as people or as people with equally valid needs they put themselves in dangerous positions so they are pursued because to them thats love all the while verbally abusive they arent hated by the family not at all everyone is obsessed with trying to understand why they arent ok why is everything we do causing this person pain we leave them alone after they want space they say thats demented abuse we try and talk and call and check up they block you asked to be left alone try to be close and you move wrong and theyll say how youre a bad person and always have been sick i hate this internet idea that the scapegoat is so nice and just got blamed for things what about it the black sheep is completely erratic and abusive unable to hold stable relationships with anyone never had a long term relationship and cant even keep a job then if anyone else has needs or is depressed they invalidate them completely whether parents or siblings they call everyone with needs or boundaries selfish or abusive tell me what this is not an abused scapegoat and abuser nd child who gets attention and their way through threats and lashing out i have not called the person one bad name but if i do something innocuous that they dont like they will send me a page text about how im a im and deserve everything bad that can happen to me and also they wont speak to me for a year tell me how thats the poor victim of the family the scapegoat everyone suffers in abusive families full stop
hey so i just want some unbiased feedback from people regarding if my cousins were abused growing up they both would insist they werent but the older one f same age as me is currently in rehab for alcohol abuse after her rd dui after moving across the country to california by herself shes made a lot of bad decisions over the years but she used to be my best friend when we were younger i know shes suffered from anabul for a long time and had a miscarriage when we were she has openly had issues with her dad my uncle since we were teens but has verbalized for the last few years on and off that nobody cares about her and her family treats her like shit my younger cousin m i currently live with and love to absolute pieces but hes also been through a lot his parents kicked him out during covid at the age of with no job because they were moving almost hours away and wanted to live child free ive expressed many a time how shocking this was to my cousin when he told me about it and it severely changed my overall outlook on my aunt and uncle he couch surfed for years off and on until i was able to get him a job working with me and he was able to move in with me and my best friend weve lived together for over a year now and things were overall happy but recently hes been dealing with a lot again my best friend and my cousin are both queer and a messed up situation occurred on the grindr app between the two of them but long story short my best friend ended up coordinating a voyeur event involving my cousin this has caused shock waves throughout the house obviously and my cousin has every right to be extremely upset after a lot of confusion some things were cleared up from the extra person that was involved with this and it was proven that my best friend did not touch my cousin this does not change the fact that the entire situation was effed up and orchestrated but i do believe with intense therapy for both of them that something can be worked out however i also do not believe that with all of the stuff going on with my cousin that he had any right to lash out at me in the car for explaining how i feel like our coworkers are harassing me at work for context my cousin is into edgelord dumb alt right style comedy and likes to make transphobic homophobic racist etc jokes at work sometimes the trade field i am in is almost all men and i am one of two women in our whole shop there were more before but after the last one quit for a different job all these jokes have just gotten so much worse i constantly feel like i am getting egged on for my reaction one example was last week i was told i should get stung by a bee for the experience after talking about how my grandma was deathly allergic this kind of things been happening almost weekly since january and i vented to my cousin in the car ride home i give him car rides almost every work day and he just absolutely blew up on me he screamed about how i need to get the eff over it how he has to tell me like it is because when i get upset it ruins the whole vibe for him and he just wants to have fun at work i told him that edgy jokes are fun when theyre not pointed directly at someone and he just wouldnt put himself into my shoes and continually told me to get thicker skin there was a lot more that was said but long story short he basically cannot accept that he could be wrong in this situation and even if it was all jokes if it hurts someone its not worth making them i know thats how he was raised his dad specifically gives no effs about equality woke culture etc and theyve always been very well off their whole lives so my cousins feel that anybody who has trauma or gets upset about little things need to suck it up because thats what their parents told them my uncle still calls depression the dark place i do know that hes currently in therapy but i fear that the damage to his kids is too far gone my dad my uncles brother died in and my mom is a single mom whos been working at a grocery store for years but can still find time to love and empathize with her child she was also very upset to hear that my cousin was kicked out during covid and she bought him a queen size mattress to sleep on while he stayed at her house with my sister for a few months before moving in with me i just want to know the best way to move forward with my cousins the older one in california i fear is a lost cause shes been told to move back home so many times and she just wont the cousin that i live with didnt come home last night after our blow up because i texted him setting my boundaries going forward not allowed to use my coffee and no more rides to work and texted back shooting off things to hit below the belt like my weight how i am rotting because i dont go out and see friends every night like he does etc i want to be there for him because of all the things he is going through but i also need to protect my peace thoughts
serious question i feel like this void will never go away or be filled because of having absolutely no love or support from either parents ontop of that growing up in a loveless abusive household caused me to have trust issues depression anxiety ptsd lack of confidence and constantly putting myself down how does one cope with all of this does it ever go away
im and for almost my entire life my mom has been very verbally and emotionally abusive when i was little she would frequently blame me for things i never did calling me insults and making me feel iike trash i developed severe ptsd from this and its safe to say my brain is permanently altered by the abuse my mom now is in therapy trying to get over it she blames everything that happened to me on her depression downgrading it saying it wasnt a big deal that im being dramatic that a little yelling wouldnt scar me is that really true i want to love my mom i do i dont want to be rebellious or bad and say that i i dont love her because i really really want to and shes trying her best to recover even if shes failing she says that i cant hate her that im obligated to love her because she went through abuse too but i just dont know i dont want to be a bad kid i just want to know im not being bad by saying i dont love her
i moved back into my moms place a few months ago i thought shed changed shed been helpful and seemingly nice while i was living out of state i felt like id been the issue all along and that moving back in was best for me i found out over these past months that it truly feels like she likes to fight me on everything i try to not talk to her and still its always ending in her screaming at me she put her hands on me and excuses it still honestly i feel more worried for my cat here she has cancer and ibd so im trying not to stress her out i find her huddled up scared now im between going back to the city that gave me financial issues and turned me here or a city i dont really know as well but my partner would be an hour away the previous city has a better job and i know the vet specialist and all the other is more unknown but still im closer to my partner i just dont know whats right now i thought this was even the vet here has been terrible jobs unreliable

look im no misogynist i believe in equality in all things in life be it gender race religion sexual preference etc but ive been on the receiving end of a lot of abuse from women in my life my mom my sister an ex girlfriend and consciously im fully aware that people dont represent a whole gender and its not cool to hold it against them but then i get on social media and see some of the things women on there say and all and all its quite soulcrushing i dont wanna be that type of guy and above that i dont even think its fair but i cant help but to harbour some negative feelings toward women i try to remember that a lot of men have treated me pretty poorly as well and in general do far worse stuff but the psychological torment ive gotten from those women effects me in ways i really wish it didnt

mom wants me to forgive step dad for some context im and my mom has severe anger issues i had to run away to a friends house once because it got so bad where everyday she would come home and take out her anger on me we ended up reconcilingin reality she stopped for weeks and only used emotional abuse instead of slapping me whenever i spoke some examples of this emotional abuse would be claiming i never help around the house or saying its a my name moment when something bad happens or claiming im always against her or saying i always do something i dont do however of the time besides those its just yelling at me to either shut up or nonsense about me that isnt true but ive grown accustomed to it and it actually doesnt affect me much anymore now to start the story i was in the house cleaning with my stepdad and mom screamed at me over a stain behind the counter i didnt notice she says a bunch of things on top of that i dont remember because to cope i usually ignore whatever she says besides the command i laughed it off a bit this time as an extra and according to my mothers report my stepdad really didnt like that now my mother finishes yelling at me i finish cleaning and we go outside but right before my stepdad says to clean the stairs im really pissed i just got yelled at so i say under my breath dude always telling me to do sum like he my dad my stepdad hears this or hears me say fuck off according to my mothers report later which i did not say and says who tf are you talking to and starts choking me i punch him and we get into a brawlwhich i dont remember much of except for him biting my hand which my mom will not take time to the doctor for because she washed it with soap and water and put peroxide on it with my mom breaking us up fast foward tldr because im tired of typing i refuse to be alone with my stepdad because of this and today shes forcing me to be alone in the house with him to clean up so she can have good day that i never let her have she alsos saying hes open to forgiveness as if he didnt fucking attack me and im being selfish for giving her so much stress by complaining
my dad is now and although i feel guilty i see him very rarely when i make myself see him i remember why i dont he will fly off the handle over tiny things he shouts screams throws things and insults me every time i see him and hes always been like this when we were younger he would hit us but he doesnt do that anymore as he knows hes too weak and wouldnt win today i go around to see him for the first time in months and the first thing he says is how fat and round my face is i ask him why does this matter and he said it doesnt he then proceeds to say this every time he looks at me and after an hour and after i had cleaned his home i told him to stop calling me fat and he shouted at me telling me ive always been far too insecure over my weight and when i asked him why he thought this was he told me he didnt know so i told him it was him he has always told me im fat stupid lazy useless hes told me all of my partners have been too good for me even the abusive alcoholic and has never had a good word to say about me but he was shocked that this has caused my feelings of insecurity is he stupid or does he do it for the reaction he knows i have a problem with my weight but he still says it and when i dont react he says it until i do im not even actually fat im a uk size but yes my face is round im so angry right now but i know in a couple of months ill feel guilty and go see him again and itll be the same outcome has anyone else had this cycle and how do i break it tldr my dad calls me fat insults me every time i see him but i feel guilty not seeing him because hes old what do i do
its been months since ive blocked my mom for talking shit about me havent heard from her from my grandmother i live with her and my mom lives in another country so i dont know if she knows i blocked her its not like she has ever been interested into worrying about what her daughters are doing or how theyve been but sometimes it kinda hits me because how can you cope with the fact that your daughters dont love you and you dont seem to care she just married her boyfriend so i guess theres more important things in her life
i really am sick of this my parents have been doing this since i was the main thing is my dad my father is blind and makes it his personality hes calm at times but if your voice is tired he snaps like dont give me that additude or mumbles oh f and if you try talking serious he just sighs and ignores me on the other hand we have my mother shes been through all lot of stuff so she does have trauma i believe still one of the things she does is horrible let me play the conversation basically me mom do you think maybe you can set an appointment for me to get checked for a mental illness mom oh gr honey if i can do it without all this things today anyone can also you never show signs of any mental illness s i have looked up my symptoms and secretly checked with online doctors i have a high rating in autism or adhd but my parents are strict so knocking and privacy isnt real here for example if you close the door as you use the restroom you get yelled at for probably doing weird things in there another example if i bring up something that happened to my friend and stop speaking they need to know most times ill say no they asked me to keep it private while my dad and mom say b tell us is she doing drugs stop fing being so god darn secretive yes they openly cussed around me since birth im only realizing its bad now i do know that there is something wrong with me at night for a good minutes in my head i just hear laughing straight up laughing for minutes each night i also have very weird habits i love the sight of blood and killing just sounds funish but also horrible or something i also stalk people for fun its a weird addiction that kinda makes me excited i will physically stalk and track everything about someone and randomly stop my mom also hates that im in this phase i do not think i am in a phase and think i need mental help but i guess self harm and anorexia doesnt need help in her eyes my parents are both homophobic and are only fine with lesbians bi or gay anything else n their eyes is mentally ill fers if i came out as nonbinary lesbian my mother and father would most likely hate me
ive been thinking about this question for a while and i think im wrongoverreacting cause he is sometimes nice but he often hits us gives me so much responsibility with my younger siblings often forgets me at school leaving me to take care of me siblings let me give you a senario to understand one time i had an after school activity at school it was over and i had a guitar make up lesson soon after as i missed one the previous week and keep in mind the activities at school end at around pm i called my dad who said im minutes away wait please i waited said minutes called him again wait just more minutes fyi my guitar lesson was at around so we had to leave at maximum if we wanted to make it and that was the time i panicked and called my mom who said wait a couple minutes ill call him i might have to get you a taxi i had never been in a taxi by myself at the time i was btw and was extremely socially anxious so i hesitated so i decided to wait hours had past i missed my guitar lesson it was around pm dad arrives this has not been the first time this has happened but i end up going in the taxi ok sorry im rambling but i wanted to mention one last thing he forgets me at my guitar lessons doesnt care for my events meaning he doesnt care if im late as it doesnt concern him and hits me a lot is he neglectful and abusive or am i being ungrateful as he often spoils me at times
are childhood spankings really meant to be this traumatic growing i was spanked somewhat frequently by my parents up until about age and then it slowed down i dont remember much about those spankings thankfully when i was i was at grandmas house and was was spanked very hard with what i believe was to be a yardstick she hit me times as i counted i was laying on the ground and out of no where no warning or anything she somehow sneakily pulled my pants and underwear down without me noticing how i dont know and started spanking me very hard to were the bruises blisters and blood the pain lasted for about a week it hurt to sit down i remember i had to sit on a towel that night in the bath because it hurt and the water stung to the point of me crying in the bath that night it was very traumatizing and even now as a adult i still regularly have ptsd from it i wake up from nightmares dry heaving and having panic attacks over the years from it as a kid after it happened and as a adult after that whenever my parents would try to spank me i was terrified and i would start shaking so bad to the point of having a seizure from it my last spanking was at years old and thankfully after that incident spankings were infrequent and rare i cant even say i had a spanking at and only once at and no more after that are spankings really meant to be this bad is it abuse or is it normal and i am just being sensitive and had a sensitive reaction to as a kid i see all theses post about how people are happy they grew up with spankings and i just dont get how someone can say that
i am moving out of the house and my mother is abusive i dont know what to do to help my sister before i move so she is ready she is and being an eleven yearold as any other she doesnt like school she avoids chores she sneaks treats and a few other things i am used to being the one to take care of her make sure she is doing her school work and eating well idk what she is going to do when i am gone she is always told to be like me and i set a high standard since i picked up most of the slack my parents left behind them i cant seem to help her understand that school and good grades is her ticket out of home early that chores keep mom happy and that hours of youtube shorts a day is not only a poor way to spend her time but also unhealthy i have two more weeks but it is starting to feel like not enough i want her to have healthy things to lean to and habits to keep life comfortable like i had i just dont want her to take years of abuse and trauma to build those things just simple stuff like getting up early avoiding life by focusing on school and hobbies more and keeping things tidy i would sleep til almost noon avoid life by porn and drugs and focus on video games and daydreams and was a mess it took me probably five years to switch those to the good things now i have been trying to help her build good habits for a while now but i dont think she understands i am worried she will have to figure it out herself but if i had been one inch off track i would be a dropout since my freshman year running away from home and getting into fights or i may have gone through with my suicide i dont want her to go through the same things i did i want to help her skip them but she is tired of listening to me cause i never let her eat treats and ice cream or skip chores for a day i dont think she understands the importance of some of it i am currently trying a chart i useduse to get myself out of depression where it is a checklist starting with basic daily hygiene going to productive things chores and school and ending ingame time and fun what else can i do
i wont bother with much detail because i have already gone through therapy and ive been out of contact with them for years i was going through my drive to find my resume to make updates and happened to see her new email address started with brokenheartedmother i emailed and called shortly after because as much as she was the reason i felt desperate enough to become a sex worker ive gotten out of that since and she convinced me my worth was so little that i stayed in another very abuse relationship for years without reaching out she was also the one that saved me from the same feeling when i was a pre teen sort of she did physically but i was then separated from the family for a year and was diagnosed mood nos in an american psych ward i still feel really bad i have to go to bed soon and i wouldnt want her to hurt herself and the email name is a huge red flag im assuming the worst i have no idea what is going on with her and im scared she doesnt live in town i dont have a car or her addressim trying to journal it out but i need some feedbackadvice im going to try to get more therapy tomorrow this is so confusing if anyone else has been through this sort of thing tell me what you did
neither option is good but which one do you think would be worse or is worse to deal with parents who physically hit their kids or parents who are emotionallyverbally abusive towards their kids
hi this is my second post here im asking for advice this time because im really at a loss im an adult who had to move back in with my abusive parents after being out on my own for a significant period of time its been such a degrading experience that i sometimes wonder if i wouldve been better off just being homeless ive been working a lot on trying to set boundaries in general i essentially had zero autonomy as a childteen and because of this i became a people pleaser who let everyone walk all over me like a doormat im done being that way its fucking exhausting the thing is its nigh impossible to set even simple boundaries with my parents they still treat me like a childteen if you read my last post it was about how they still try to ground me and take my things away when i pay the bill for it ex my phone and they refuse to accept that im an adult now recently i got a new job that pays a significantly better wage than what i was making before im so happy because this may finally be my chance to get back out from under their roof the thing is the onboarding process has been slow lots of training and then waiting for the state to approve my certificates etc for the past month or so my mother has been asking me five or six times a day every single day if ive heard anything from my job and im not even exaggerating its the same question five times a day seven days a week for the past month it drives me up the fucking wall my mother besides being extremely manipulative and sometimes physically violent is a very nosy person and will be absolutely relentless when it comes to getting any information she wants whether its her business or not its very much a habit for her to harp on me and my sibling who is also an adult and lives here about anything and everything because she claims nothing gets done if im not breathing down your neck its incredibly invasive and besides that its not even effective my temperament heavily aligns with symptoms of pathological demand avoidance which means her reminders and frequent questions have the opposite effect and only serve to cause me more anxiety and resentment ive tried to be very firm with her ive told her multiple times to stop asking me about my job and that ill tell her when i hear something so she doesnt need to ask she always responds with threats of violence and says that it doesnt matter how many times she asks me something if she asks me a question i am to answer it without argument or complaint lest i want to get beaten i know these are probably just empty threats because if she really wanted to beat me she would have already but shes beaten me before and i know for a fact she would do it again yesterday i told her again to stop asking me that this is a nonnegotiable boundary im standing on and if she continues to ask me from this point forward im just going to ignore her she said that im never allowed to ignore her for any reason and that if i do ignore her there will be consequences again threatening violence i know this is probably such a simple and trivial thing but it honestly wouldnt matter what boundary i was trying to set if i do anything at all that they dislike they threaten and harass me i just dont know what to do because when i do get out of this house im going nocontact with both of them and im terrified because i know theyd go to the ends of the earth to force me to stay in their lives ive dealt with harassment from nonfamily members before and unfortunately law enforcement was not helpful about it whatsoever so i have very little hope ill ever be able to cut contact with them at all
i was somewhat abused by my parents growing up and i think they both have anger issues and problems with lack of emotionempathy its gotten better in recent years but we still argue sometimes however on days like today sometimes my dad just snaps at me out of nowhere he yelled saying that i was being rude to him and had a bad temper wed been having a conversation for the past minutes and whilst i was a little frustrated having to explain something to him over and over again i was by no means being rude i go up to my room and was honestly triggered by him shouting it brought me back to when i was a kid within minutes he comes to my door pouting like a toddler and asks me what i want for dinner as a way of apologising without actually having to admit hes in the wrong he does this often and it pisses me off so much why do you have the right to treat me like shit then try to guilt me by acting like a child when youre years old it just make me feel so shit when he yells at me and has no empathy because im alone in this world and have no one else to comfort me or show me affection
throw away account female y so this has happened for a couple of years especially when i was a teenager i give her the benefit of the doubt because i was a shit teenager but i finally moved out at and went to university fast forward years i had a few things happened and i was going to become homeless during the time i was living away from my mum she kept asking and telling me to move back if everything wasnt okay and i finally did i had no home and i needed somewhere to live so after her telling me time and time again to move back with her to get back on my feet i did i have only been living here for a couple of months trying to find a job paying rent with the money i have saved up because i cant live here free but since moving back i keep getting told i never want you when you move out again stay out i wished i dropped you at a foster home after your dad passed away you never do anything here i cook and clean almost everyday i also get told about my physical appearance jeez you have gotten big you look fat in that you look homeless wear nicer clothes and i understand a mother should never say stuff like that to her children but she is my mum and i love her but recently its been more bad things than good things and i dont know what i need to do cause i cant really leave i need to stay here to earn money so i can move out again but i also cant leave the room when she is saying shit like that to me even though i have explained to her that i need to leave the room right now can we talk about this in mins and its also not just me that feels like this i have three other brothers that agree but i also believe she is worse with me because it a motherdaughter relationship and she never got along with her mum or even her sister
i was in a relationship for years years in we had a daughter my partner and i were really disconnected and had large boundaries from both of our families for valid reasons ill touch on a bit later my ex partner year old and i lived together in our own house we rented until we split up after years went by and after having a child my partner cheated on me with a year old and walked away from us and the affair had gotten my ex daughters mom involved into a cult which drove her mad little to say i have full custody and my daughters mom and hasnt been around for years now needless to say im and im still building my career in life so i dont make crazy amount of money cant afford daycare rent and living costs a lone this had forced me to reach out to my abusive mother for a living arrangement only family i have who struggles with a narcissistic personality and suffers from borderline personality disorder and who had mentally abused me at a very young age i go through a tough breakup and i lose my inner family just to have to move into my controlling mothers home with my year old my mom has phases where she is a great person but also has weeks or days where she a horrible person almost like im not her son and my child isnt her granddaughter im sure this falls into having bpd im struggling mentally and i know my child needs me mentally present ive tried having serious convos with my mom about my mental health and our relationship possibly having counseling to improve our relationship but she takes it as a jokebullies and only blames me my mom watches my year old while im at work i do pay her but she doesnt seem very attentive to her meaning my mom will sit on her phone while my child will self entertain the moment i get home from work my mom kicks up her feet and she no longer helps me with anything which i can understand because she isnt her parent and she isnt obligated too i work hvac construction so im fairly tired when i get home in a f attic most of the time my mom doesnt abide by any of my parenting rules so naturally my child looks at me like im bad cop and even calls me mean from time to time and has grandma syndrome i feel like im losing my patience way more and its hard to focus on my day to day life due to these distractions i have no idea what to do besides when my daughter turns this fall get her enrolled in school and find an apartment and cut my mother off any suggestions
uhh are my parents abusive idk if they are or not uh they are extremely homophobic and transphobic my dad threatened to kick me into the basement because i told my younger sibling girls can marry girls my mom and dad have screamed at me just because i didnt have my hair up and ive been beaten and yelled at for not smiling in pictures ive been hit with a wooden stick thing walker before because my sisters were fighting or smth my mom yellsscreams at me for little things just today some of my friends reported my self harming and depression to a school counselor and they called my dad and he beat me and said if i hear that shit again im gonna hurt you so tomorrow i have to pick up every stick and leaf in the backyard and im grounded very grounded my parents arent always mean beatinghitting is the punishment here but they are nice sometimes they arent alcoholics or anything they can be nice they just dont seem to care about my mental health or anything i likewanna do my mom said she sees an image for me in the future and me being a trans masc doesnt fit her image as well as me liking same gendersex but they are nice most the time my dad will get grumpymad at everyone when he is in a bad mood which is daily happens at some point in the day i just dont know if id consider them abusive these are just some things they do any well it seems physical punishment is normal idk i like my parents when they arent yelling at mein a bad mood they can be pretty nice i dont remember the last time ive had loving affection from them but like i am so ig its normal plus i have younger siblings they have to give attention to they think about my interests and seem to care well my interests and likes they approve of like drawing my mom wont let me get a haircut cus ill cut it too short and she wont like it she said shell take me to get highlights tho so ig i have that wont get rid of my gender dysphoria but according to her it will make me feel better about it so
my mom has always been abusive to me ever since i remember existing she would hit me or scream at me for the smallest stuff she never played with me as a kid she was in a bad mood so i could never even have a normal conversation with her i got used to it quickly she would beat me in public and if i cried she would force me to stop we moved to america a couple years ago and im almost now she is still very mentally abusive but she stopped hitting me shes never sorry for hurting me she never admits that shes wrong and whenever she hurts me i start crying and screaming because i just want this nightmare to end and whenever i start screaming she says that im disrespecting her she mocks me when i cry she tells me to stop crying she threatens to send me back to the country we came from and she knows that i love it here and that if we go back i will literally lose everything and just kill myself but she doesnt care she blames everything on me she keeps saying hurtful things and expects me not to cry i cant even tell anyone from my family because they will tell her that i talked to them about it and she will get even more mad i just want this to end and she keeps saying that she regrets taking me to america with her because i make her life harder i want her to respect my feelings i want everything to be fine i want a normal happy family like all of my friends have i want to be able to come home from school without being scared of whats going to happen to me i want to run away i cant do this anymore i know that this will never end no matter how much she apologizes no matter how much i tell her that she hurts me she just doesnt give a shit im on the verge of killing myself the only thing thats keeping me alive is my girlfriend but this is not helping me anymore either
its just so sad seeing my mom like that like seeing an animal stuck in a trap they dont understand how they got there and why they cant get out of it i know shes alone because of her actions toward pretty much every person she ever knew i finally accepted she would never change no matter how hard i tried i just cant help but feel guilty because it was supposed to be my job to take care of her
for context i am transmasc and live with her i have had problems with my mother for a while now and my boyfriend has been saying what im telling him about my mom sounds like abuse she almost never hits me so it didnt cross my mind at first but its getting worse and im terrified of her to the point of panic attacks when i think about standing up to her she had always been a loving mom in my opinion but when i turned around things began going downwards with our relationship recently i had wanted to go up to my room with my partner and watch a movie she was not ok with this which is understandable but i had offered for my yo sister to come and watch it with us and promised the door would remain open and no innapropriate things would happen my mother is very against me having almost any physical contact with my boyfriend which includes cuddling even right in front of her with just his arm around me my boyfriend decided to try and talk to my mother about how she treats him as if he only thinks aboutwants sex from our relationship hes on the asexual spectrum and he felt disrespected so mentioned that he didnt feel very respected at all and my mother yelled at him and kicked him out demanding respect afterwards i wanted to talk to her so we sat on opposite sides of my door and i told her how i felt about her i told her that i just wanted love from my partner and that not everything leads to sex and she needs to learn that she responded by yelling at me through the door then i told her im done with the conversation and asked her to leave to which she slammed my door open and began screaming at me that im so disrespectful and that the world revolves around me and how im selfish and i must think shes stupid for saying that i dont just want sex from my boyfriend i was afraid she was going to hit me she didnt and i backed away into the wall she continued screaming at me and cussing me out while i slumped to the floor crying and saying im scared she told me to get the fuck downstairs and that she was going to call my dad i told her i need to be alone and she thought i was going to try and kill or hurt myself i told her i wouldnt and she yelled to keep my door open and that im so damn selfish i got the nerve to ask her why she was like this and she just scoffed at me and mimicked the question back to me then left there have been more situations very similar to this where she did hit me not hard and usually just my hand or arm and im beginning to think she might not be the hero of a mom i though she was she has threatend me previously with my comforts music my bf my stuffies ect and has sometimes not let me eat she goes out almost every weekend to drink and get fucked coming home either really late or the next day leaving me to babysit my younger siblings and yos then i have to take care of her while shes hung over i make breakfast lunch i bring her everything she needs while she sleeps all day yesterday she had a breakdown in my arms sobbing and sniffling i had just been crying and she knew that but still expected comfort from me she has a good reason to be sad her bestfriends death was a year ago yesterday but shes been making me take care of my sibling so often they feel like my own kids my sister feels a similar way about our mother idk if this is enough info but please give me your opinions and advice

first of all my parents are more neglectful than abusive and i dont know if this is the correct place to ask since i dont know a lot about subreddits my apologies if this doesnt belong here so around january this year i found a kitten it is a female and we already have a male cat with us my parents loved the kitten and pretended there was no way to find her another household so we kept her the problem is my parents are against sterilisation on animals also my male cat is completely emaciated since he fights with a ton of other cats for females in my town since i found this kitten my siblings and i have been trying to convince my parent to sterilise the female cat since we think itll be awful for her and us to be having kittens every once in a while its not the first time we are in this kind of situation and what they do is wait for the kittens to be old enough to be with another family so right now both of the cats are trying to mate is there any way i can convince my parents to sterilise at least one of the cats i cant get in too much trouble with them since they are pretty toxic and cant discuss things properly there was already a time my father and i had a heated argument about not mating my dog with his coworkers dog and i cant take her to the vet myself since i dont have any money

hi i came on here to ask if this was just a punishment or like physical abuse so from when i was my current age my father has punished me and my sister by staying in pushup position for hours when we would act out or do something to make him mad he would yell at us while he forced us to stay in pushup position as we cried and pleaded to stop if we got out of push up position he would slam things against walls to make noise and scare us into doing what he wanted i recently asked my sister what she remembers about her childhood before i was born and she mentioned how my dad used to hit her to me this seems very possible given how often we were scared shitless that he would hit us and the form of punishment he uses if only one of us me or my sister were in trouble he would punish us the same way expect he would make us watch the other one in pain i rember one time when i was around ten he made us do pushup position in the middle of an ace hardware store and yelled at us about embarrassing we are anyways is this abuse or just punishment

hi all i have been talking with my therapist about this a lot recently and she suggested i reach out to a group of people who might better understand what im going through so here i am not really looking for advice as i know what to do in these situations now just trying to get a little frustration off my chest some background about me and my family to preface my parents have always been authoritative in their parenting style very akin to how my grandparents raised them theyre very rarely physically abusive but beatings have never been totally out of the question even as ive emerged into adulthood i frequently get told i can still whoop your ass mostly as a scare tactic but i have no doubt they would still do so if they felt inclined they are both extremely manipulative in many different ways verbally and psychologically abusive i have been guilt tripped gaslit threatened and more all my life i know not all narcissists are abusive by default and i dont want to paint all of them in a bad light but i would be lying if i said narcissistic abuse isnt a real thing that ive been subject to my entire life both my parents are incredibly entitled but especially my dad who very much has grandiosity a lack of empathy and exhibits exploitive behavior among other things when i was almost i got a stable and wellpaying job that allowed me to move out on my own i signed a year lease on a shitty cheap apartment because i was desperate to get out from under my parents roof it was the best year of my life and full of so much discovery and healing i was living paychecktopaycheck and despite rent taking up more than half of my income most months i was just happy to finally be on my own when my year lease was up i had to move back into my parents house my landlord was going to raise my rent by over if i were to renew my lease and i just couldnt afford it i essentially had two options move back in with my parents or be homeless reluctantly i chose the former knowing it would only be temporary and at the very least i would have my own room and a warm bed to sleep in soon after i moved in with my parents i got laid off from my job it was a huge setback i quickly found another job but it only paid about half as much i went from making hr to hr despite this i did not have to pay rent sort of my parents force me to pay them a month to contribute to the mortgage payment and was completely financially independent when it came to all my other expenses phone bill car insurance car payment credit card gas food you name it i paid for it myself the only thing my parents helped me out with was health insurance because im chronically ill and sometimes the meds i need can be very expensive despite being almost completely independent financially and having paid out of pocket myself to own the majority of my possessions my parents still frequently threaten to take these things away if they dislike how i behave their reasoning being that your things are in my house and i pay the mortgage therefore your possessions actually belong to me which isnt even true since they make me contribute to the mortgage payments anyways for instance i got into an argument with my father last december wherein he took away my phone my laptop and my car keys i am almost years old the title of the car and the phone line are in my name and i exclusively pay for them i had to call out of work for two days and explain to my supervisor that my dad had stolen my car keys and wouldnt give them back so i wasnt able to drive to and from work it was very embarrassing and humiliating to have to explain that as an adult i had essentially been grounded in hindsight i should have called the cops as soon as it happened i have verifiable proof that all of the things he grounded me from belong to me im not sure why i didnt but i know now that if something like that ever happens again thats the action i can take they have not taken any more of my possessions since then but they still frequently threaten to do so i have told them multiple times that i am an adult and they can no longer ground me as if i were a teenager especially when i pay to have these things but they dont care ive started keeping a log with dates and times of every time they threaten to take my things just in case i need it i have a paper copy of my cars title and proof of my phone bill payments hidden away so if the time ever comes where i do need to take action against them i will have everything i need to prove my case and i had an extra hidden set of car keys made in the event that the original ones are taken i dont really know what else to say other than that i just feel stuck here i guess im so fed up with my boundaries being blatantly disrespected every single day even though ive worked so incredibly hard to be assertive about them if youve ever experienced anything like this and youre comfortable sharing please let me know i know i cant be the only one if you made it to the end thank you for reading this far

my earliest memory was him watching halloween with me when i was a toddler then it was him chasing me around with a scream mask when i was about years old when i was in rd grade he would jumpscare me every day when i came home from school i would usually get upset when he did it and his response was always like why are you so sensitive or its just a joke why dont you laugh crybaby etc i mean sure i probably would have thought it was funny if you didnt fucking force feed me horror movies as a kid then complain when i hated it duh to this day i get startled very easily and sometimes i can get irritated if someone comes up behind me and jumpscares me ive also witnessed my dad scaring my year old nephew from behind and he was visibly shaken afterward from time to time i remember these things and i just start getting angry thinking about it and thats just the tip of the iceberg with him hes done way worse to me but thats another story why would anyone enjoy scaring kids was he a psychopath
my father cheated and lied to my mother their entire marriage he even convinced me and my siblings that she was crazy and making everything up which caused us to resent her for some time now that i know the truth im just angry i wish i could confront him but im still scared of him a lot of things from my childhood are coming back to haunt me as of lately i messaged my old teacher who used to go out of her way to embarrass me in front of my peers the other night im just angry and i dont know what to do i have never been to therapy because i know it will only traumatize me again i just wish i could move on but its not that easy
i f have a little sister f who lives with her dad m still i moved out at due to his verbalemotional abuse and alcoholism ive kept low contact with him but have tried to stay in my sisters life by texting her regularly and having her come stay with me for a night here and there i know narcissists never change he is a textbook example of one and if it werent for her i wouldve gone no contact with him when i left after i moved out i called cps on him and visited a domestic violence officer rcmp with video evidence of my dad physically abusing my sister this asshat told me it wasnt abuse it was discipline this still makes me sick to this day cps visited the home a couple times and after talking to my dad closed the file hes very good at manipulation and lying and instructed us kids to do the same if anyone ever asked about what happened inside the home i found out recently that he is still drinking regularly despite claiming for years that hell stop he had pulled my sister out of school to homeschool her for a couple years before enrolling her in the outreach that i went to when i was shes still there ive reached out to the teachers a couple times requesting that they keep an eye on her and theyve assured me she is safe when she is there but arent able to disclose any info thats fine i would like to know what other avenues i can follow to make sure that my sister isnt being screamed at abused and malnourished like i was shes turning in a couple months but still has the skeletal lankyness of a year old im so worried about her she doesnt tell me anything about how her dad treats her but i have enough experience with him to know that she could very well be neglected and abused to some degree i have considered calling a welfare check on her but what would that really do especially with his past of manipulation i absolutely do not want to risk having that contact with her cut off any advice helps thanks
i live in indiana and i have a friend whos ex boyfriend was abusive she is worried about whenif he gains visitation rights that he will be abusive towards the children is it legal for the children to record without his knowledge and if so what are the best ways to do so the kids are and which the yo is his bio kid so it would be that one that he has its still up in the air if he would pursue rights for the other or if the other would go as well to protect the younger using a phone would probably not be an option if the yo were to go alone

so ive struggled with depression during my teenage years which led to my room being a bit messy as a kid ive since learned how to clean after it was beaten into me growing up however ive relapsed some since getting my own place hours away and grad school and jobs have been keeping me busy i graduate soon and theres a gap between the end of the ceremony and celebration dinner reservations with family and friends my mom the physically abusive one has said that since my grandparents are coming this would be a good time for everyone to see if my childhood lessons have held up in terms of keeping my apartment straight i immediately said i wouldnt allow them inside but mostly because i dont want to be in a room alone with them and that because i will admit there is a bit of mess i live in a studio my mother has taken this so far as to say that she will call my apartment manager to get inside my father he sad me until age but i never spoke up about it bc ive only just begun to realize thats what was happening has stated that if they cant go to my apartment then ill lose any financial help i dont really ask them for anything except if rent hits right after taxes this year im terrified of my parents and i finally felt free having my own space that hasnt been touched by my parents or grandparents i want to stand firm because its my graduation but im scared that ill be alone with only two friends as a support system are there any tips for standing my ground that wont completely ruin things

for around years now both my parents have been what i think is abusing me my mum uses her severe migraines to get away with anything and everything like recently i started doing wordle and she used her migraines as an excuse when she texts me the word my dad is actually abusing me though i cant say how many fucking times hes said fuck my life when i ask for help and he swears at me constantly whenever i find a way to do something not the ordinary way but i like it more and it wont affect my dad he stands up and shouts at me aggressively to do it his way he also conventionly need me to do something every time i want to go out he finds the need to always be in control and often only seems happy when im not the one smiling after he berates me he always says how much he loves me but never shows it and after all this he gives a lousy apology on text and forgets it i have never stood up to my parents and im really on my breaking point and im scared theyll physically hurt me if i do they also both find it funny when they make fun of me and make my siblings play along and make fun of eachother they decided to fatshame me today when im kg under obese my mum hates it when i make fun of her or anyone does at this point ive had hundreds of suicidal thoughts and tried it countless times but always reassure myself it will get better but will it i dont know what to do please help
my mom has been abusive for as long as i can remember one of my earliest memories was being thrown against the wall by my hair as a toddler she used excessive force to punish me often times i was just exhibiting the normal developmental behavior that comes with each age group in middle school i had head lice for years straight and she often made me cry i didnt know why mom was so mean she would use threats to kill me to keep me in line often getting into my face pointing her finger screaming as a teenager whenever i spoke out against how she treated me or did anything she didnt like she would hit me it became a daily thing for her to hit meso much that when i drove w her as an adult i flinched when she made a rapid movement she once slapped my face and strangled me my mom distorts truth and one time as a teen when she was going to attack me i was literally begging for her not to hit me please mom dont stop i was in a sitting position on the couch and as she lunged at me i pushed her off of me with my feet i got in sever trouble with this wait until i get your dad you little bitch more violence from him to this day she tells people i kicked her in the stomach im emotional now even thinking about this my mental health hasnt been good as an adult my closest family members never got me into treatment when i tried to kill myself as a teen and young adult it escalated and led to some really difficult timesinstability i always sought counseling and have even been in programs but i actually needed acute care no one intervened as i struggled and my mental health deteriorated to point where i was hearing voicesextremely paranoid struggling with alcohol addiction and was in v unsafe environments that led to more undue trauma the only person who did assist of any sort was my mother god bless its just really hard because she was and still is emotionally abusive i think now she knows she cant assault me anymore but she still yells at me calls me names and gaslights me daily any attempts at discussing this are futile and usually leads to further screams regardless of how i approach the topic she has said that she apologizes for how she was when i was younger and shes trying to be a better person i just dont see the work shes doing again the only saving grace between us is that she has helped me when i needed picking up after some pretty hard falls her love language is acts of service and i know she loves me thanks if you made it this far im back to living with her and am seeking ways to get out again its only been months but ive had suicidal ideations and have driven myself mad with how much im gaslighted questioning whats real she wants me to go out to eat with her on mothers day but i told her im busy it just takes so much out of me to hang out with her agree with her lies and pretend that i like her im feeling bad about this am curious what your thoughts are and how you think i should proceed thanks
if youre being assaulted by abusive parents dont call the police they likely wont do anything they might even take your parents side and try to admit you to a psych hospital out of nowhere the cops are notorious for not doing anything during domestic incidents and studies have shown that many of them are also domestic abusers theyre notorious for not reporting to child protective services when theyre supposed to be mandated reporters call cps cps is a different entity and they are in charge of investigating child abuse i spent my entire childhood calling the cops and they did nothing i wish i had known to call cps instead
i love me mom and dad but my dad is a big sarcastic being not a human at all what must i do i cant help such dads at all he mocks me in public regarding my mobile addiction and i cant help it and i dont know what to even do about this i wish i was never born in this country and all children deserve parents but all parents dont deserve children why did they decide to have me they would have adopted a child still i am pissed off guys we were in a crowded place when he mocked me by calling me a kid who lost his virginity through the phone even in a luxury hotel he mocked me i got really angry what can i do guys please help me to decide what to do please give me a suggestion what i can do in these circumstances
as i talked to my childhood friend and my new friend and we all three have in common that we have abusive mothers we had to cut contact with i wondered if there was a sub for abusive parents and so i found my way in here i realized knowing this sub exists with thousands of people who has similar experiences as us helps me feel that im not alone and theres a safety in that it cant be denied or gaslighted away as easy when im reminded that theres others with mothers or fathers who are abusive i think its healing to be a part of this sub my mom was the last one i wanted to admit was abusive i shared all other traumas but the part about her i kept locked away in a secret box until i was around i dont know why it was so hard to admit she wasnt who i made her up to be maybe because it would feel like my whole childhood was a lie a shitty hurtful lie and i would lose my parent the core parent figure attached to my identity my whole life i tried to be the daughter that would make my mom love me and be normal to me i assumed i needed to help her but it was pointless she didnt let me near her and she hated therapists to this day i have still never heard her say what happened to her that made her this way all i remember is her saying why should i share my secrets to anyone thats my business and that was it seeing her happy smiling and present was like discovering a rare new bird in the sky of my memories of her shes mad or distant i dreamt about her as an alive doll several times she is alive yet not thats my image of her and it creeps me out to this day still
my dad has been contacting me lately saed me physically abused my mom a lot growing up i was naive and didnt tell the authorities earlier and went along with how my mom handled things my mom is now elderly out of it mentally and checked out and she was ashamed and wanted to stay hidden about it i see now he likes to target down on their luck women or women with something to lose like their job as a nurse for instance he enjoys making women feel bad shaming them and asserting his sense of dominance and winning my dad wants my naive moms nursing pension and made it clear he felt he deserved it having been married to her since he feels women do this to men therefore he thinks he deserves it and he takes no blame for abusing her badly many times and hes trying to use my brother to get to my mom and access what he feels should have been his since she divorced him since mothers day is coming up and he knew i was going to visit i think is why he called me privately yesterday to stress me out he made sure to insult me belittle me slut shame me etc of course never taking responsibility for bad things hes done and blaming how im just like my mom whom he loathes he hates my mom and blames her for everything in his life and takes it out on me whenever possible my dad has been a predator to women for years now he owns a home in california and rents out rooms usually to women that are struggling then he will manipulate them gaslight them and try to do whatever he can to them he also goes on dating sites and tries to find women to become his sugar mama in addition to using his cute sweet dog and his business to gain credibility and access to women recently he sent me an unsolicited obviously nude photo in his yard casually acting like its a joke hes always been allowed to say and do whatever he pleases and use fear and shame to control others i randomly thought to look at his business yelp and google and saw he has almost all good professional construction job reviews also i want him to be known as a predator but i dont necessarily want to put my name on it as he will attack me and he lives close to my mother so it can be a risk i live about hours away but i can see him just trying to get me somehow anyone have any experience with this
has anyone successfully punished them my father sad me as a kid and effectively gas lit me for years he also was physically abusive to mom etc then had audacity to shame me etc now that im way older and going through changes i see just how messed up it all is how he chose to wield his power he lives life on easy street with money he bamboozled from my pick me male validation obsessed mother his nice house his bikes his good reviews on yelp for his contractor business he hardly knows anything about me because i moved far away and keep distance but today has been telling me im miserable like my mom so she has miserable when he was abusing her shocker and i just think he doesnt deserve his life i would love to turn him in but statute of limitations and hes an absolute lying kiss ass who would do anything to save his own ass he is a man who takes advantage of down on their luck women and had a few female roomies to pay him in his home one of these women he got weird with and she attacked him im positive he instigated it and he turned it around on her and played up that he was an innocent senior citizen to the police hes absolutely insidious with no morals anyone have any experience with this with getting people like this back its also a matter of what if he in his boredom and need for drama causes me issues

posting this here because i cant find my normal abusive parents subreddit i guess im too messed up to remember the name so if you see this post twice i apologize i dont know why i still try with my mom it hurts so bad every time i feel like i get so close to a working relationship with her and always every time she does something or says something that is so cruel and unfeeling that i question why i ever tried to mend the relationship in the first place take minutes ago i am in town for my grandmothers funeral normally i am very far from their southern american town and i limit communication to only a few texts per week if that i usually stop texting when the protrump conspiracies or proisrael rants come out btw all palestinians are basically hamas did you know because i didnt lol its nuts oh and the students protesting at columbia university i live in nyc they are antisemites determined to not let jewish students get into any buildings its nutsi know several people currently protesting im in the protest chats on lex its confirmed that about a rd of those protesters are members of the jewish student union fyi so theyre kind of nuts i have been conditioned to look past this anyways minutes ago i put on s music while i made dinner with my mom so i could drown out some depression thoughts ive been having whilst here i have been pretty emotionally shut down for the past days of being here so as to not let myself get hurt i feel like a zombie every time i have to be around them the thoughts come back anyways the s music always puts my mom in a good mood and has her dancing so i think maybe since shes in a good mood maybe i can talk about setting a boundary with her to set up the boundary i am a skilled singer i have been since i was and since i was my parents really enjoyed showponying me having me sing for their friends and strangers wherever we went at every party restaurants gatherings you name it they were so proud of me and they want to show off those voice lessons that they paid for obviously when i entered my incredibly emotional puberty era it became all too much i begged them to stop i would get so embarrassed when they asked me to sing that i would have to find a bathroom and cry and hide for hours i would tell them i couldnt handle it right now i was going through a lot friends bullying me horrible menses a fun little eating disorder youre being selfish we paid for those voice lessons you better show them off that was painful to hear its still painful to hear till this day because my mother will never drop it im now and she cant let it go btw this is a small event out of hundreds of larger more hurtful events physically hurtful events so were singing well im fake singing and she knows it im just trying to show that i am enjoying the moment so she doesnt make a comment like if youre going to be so depressed around us then why come at all she starts trying some high notes and asks me to teach her i freeze up that emotional ptsd hitting me in the damn face i really want to hide in the hallway bathroom i try to work through it and teach her she says show me and i ignore it no more singing from me we finish dinner eat with my dad and all are still in a relatively good mood thank god my dad and i are talking while my mom is distracted and i actually think we had a constructive conversation where i set a real unrelatedboundary my dad is a much better listener than my mom so ive built up some confidence my mom is singing a little while playing her phone game i am cleaning up the table and i tell her you know i would love to sing with you if you werent weird about it i actually love to sing bad choice of words mom what when have i ever been weird about you singing me do you know what showponying is btw i have defined showpony for her about once a year to be fair its not commonly used in this way unless youre an improviser the real phrase that i want to say is that she pimps me out but she would be very distracted by the use of the curse word pimp mom no did you make that word up me well its when you ask someone to do something like sing for others just for your own enjoyment without caring whether the singer wants to or not mom oh my gosh stop when have i ever done that to you me yesterday at a family gathering the day beforea different but similar family gathering and also the day before thatwhen i was trying to practice privately for a song i was singing at my grandmothers funeral i really dont like it and it hurts my feelings if you promised to stop i would sing with you whenever you want id be happy to mom shuts down at this suggestion i do not do that to you ever of course you can turn any conversation negative im done talking leave me alone so i can play my game im tired and i dont want to deal with that nonsense right now i want to push back so bad i know its hopeless me well im just trying to set a boundary with you so we can have a better relationship mom just stop i cant handle your negativity me well im sorry but actually you were the one who made it negative i was just trying to solve a problem she walks away im so messed up now im a year old grown ass woman and i am on the floor of our hallway bathroom just bawling my eyes out why do i try why do i think things will change because i have hope that i can one day have a relationship with them im so jealous of my best friend who tells her mom everything i just wish i had that its stupid and i know i have to stop but i also know that im addicted to trying at this point is anyone else here still trying can anyone relate or is it just too foolish
trigger warning my mother and father are very abusive in every way and social services are now involved but i want to see if this was abuse or not before i tell my social worker when i was younger my father used to shower me now this may have been normal if your daughter was between but it only stopped when i was my friend said thats already a red flag my memories of this are really fuzzy but i remember he used to take a really long time cleaning and drying between those certain parts however apparently i kept wanting him to wash me and dry me i believe that to be somewhat true however my father all that time said he was so disappointed in me growing up and how hell miss his time doing this with me once i grow older and how its not ever going to be the same with me leaving him and i didnt want him to not love me anymore so i kept allowing him to do it and kept asking was he going to want to give me a shower my father has in the past climbed into bed with me while im asleep to try to cuddle with me and has grabbed my breasts and has also tried to kiss me so he has a history of doing things he shouldnt basically is this my fault or was i being assaulted by my father
stop being so sensitive they usually say that i cant get a joke and take things to personally its a joke when they joke about my weight they usually say its a joke dont question when we ask you to do something when i dont agree on doing something they ask me to you just do it no questioning same as above you do not have rights when i say i have a right to for example i have the right to be respected we buy you everything and you are still ungrateful when my mother usually screams at me im gonna hit you right across the face when i accidentally raise my tone when i didnt mean to watch your tone same as above if i ever find out you are gay you and your clothes will be flying out the window my father threatened me with this if i ever come out gay if i ever find out you are depressed ill smack the depression out of you he said it if i ever reveal im depressed im gonna smack the atheist out of you my mother said it after i came out as atheist im gonna send you to therapy my father said it after i defended the lgbtqia community because he is conservative and more but also my father sometimes puts my lb life when im eating and i always get emotional and tell him to turn it off
my father is he shouts berates and mocks everyone he is not all bad or anything he abuses the dog misthi too and he apologizes over and over again never changes himself a part of me wishes to be an abusive parent like him too but worse i am from india i am years old and a male his second of two sons my older brother and my dad never get along either i inherited his abusive nature and often kick head butt elbow punch and neglect the dog too he is a control freak and over scared off my well being at the same time and he is a drunk too at times i inherited drinking from him but i decided to quit drinking as i once left the dog outside the house and locked her because i was drunk and didnt want to walk her she would not get kidnapped or anything but she could have been hurt or something given how indians drive
i needed to vent mum didnt make breakfast for me in the mornings n i used to faint at school shed let me go to school with eye boogers my classmates had to tell me i need to remove them in the mornings she gave me money to buy fried food at the cafeteria sometimes my grandfather scolded my parents to take better care of me and due to societal pressure she encouraged me to eat more junk food so that id stop being skinny after i hit puberty shed make me feel bad if i was starting to gain weight im still struggling i keep thinking i wont get to get that good i liked ever again as itll be taken away from me and someone will restrict me im feeling so messed up
im helping a family member try to sort through some memories of abuse from when they were a child some of their memories took place at wayfarers chapel likely around the late s early s in palos verdes im wondering if anyone else from the area knows anyone that might have suffered abuse there even if its a rumor
so when i f turned i became pretty depressed ive never really known why as up to that point my life was pretty smooth sailing nothing traumatic my parents split up a few years before and dad moved out but they continued to talk and coparent anyway at i was depressed i didnt want to get up out of bed couldnt face going to school and honestly just wanted the world to stop but at that age i couldnt verbalise it i guess my parents didnt understand and just thought i was being lazy the first few months it was just my mum there was a lot of shouting at me to get up and threats of taking things away like toysobjects that i loved ect if i didnt get to school telling me that she was disappointed that would i do reflects badly on my siblings and on her then it turned physical first just dragging me out of bed i had a cabin bed so i got pulled down from that and it would leave marks from when i would hit my back on the steps then came the hitting my mum would scream and i would just completely shut down and because i couldnt answer i guess she thought i just wasnt answering her on purpose the hits came a few slaps on the cheek a few hits to the arms then she would throw things at me pretty much anything she had in reach in my bedroom shoes action figures i was already struggling with school before all this and then as this was happening my grades slipped more be that from the depression or the screaming and hitting i got pulled in to the head of years office and asked if everything was ok at home and it was like i knew i could say no my mums been hitting me yet i couldnt say that all i could say was yeah everythings fine because i knew if i said anything the school would have to look into it and they could not just take me away but my siblings and they didnt deserve to lose thier mum because of me my dad then moved back in told me it was because my mum didnt know how to handle me anymore that she was struggling to handle me and look after my siblings i actually thought that maybe i wouldnt spend every morning being screamed at and hit when he moved back in but i was wrong about of those my dad never hit but the shouting didnt stop he pinned me against the wall one time and told me if i didnt start behaving and doing what i was asked then i could pack my bags and leave when i finally left school and got a job and paid money towards the household it all just stopped the shouting the hitting i guess in my head i rationalised it to i made them angry with all my defiance and it wasnt their fault they didnt know i was depressed then my younger sister started doing the same thing sleeping in refusing to get up and go to school and i thought oh god theyre going to shout and hit her too but they didnt they never raised their voice once never once raised a finger towards her she was met with compassion and understanding i remember asking once why they shouted at me but not her and got scoffed at and told you were trying to wind us up and your sister is ill im now my older sibling was talking about when we were school the other day and was like remember when mum used to have to drag you out of bed god she would scream laughing my parents were there too laughing saying those were the days and i just sat there thinking am i crazy am i the only one that remembers everything that happened the thing is in my head i know it was abuse of some kind be it physical emotional yet theyve never done it since they dont talk about never apologised for it its like everyone moved on and it was just a blip i cant talk to my siblings about any of it because i know they wont understand i was the only one that went through it its like we didnt have the same parents i dont really know if i can bring it up with my parents call it abuse to their face anyway just needed a space to get it off my chest as its been running through my head the last couple of days
i have been suffering by the hands of my parents since i was a child i am now and it is still happening to this day no matter how much i point it out to them they still cant see it they keep throwing bitchfits and i am honestly so heartbroken because of all this they are the ones that are supposed to understand me the most right i dont have any friends or a partner and i feel so alone in all of this it is just me against the world i feel like nothing
how is it possible i didnt figure out they were emotionally abusive until i turned i knew i dealt with extreme parentification but explained it by we didnt know it was wrong then but shes still being toxic and manipulative to this day and is so intertwined in my life that i have no idea how to cut her off im usually so self aware but this hit me out of nowhere does anyone know what i need to look for in a therapist or life coach i have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple of days and want to go in prepared adhd unrelated to this

cuz like i get calling ur kid a bitch unwarranted is bad but if i am being a bitch or worthless or a disgrace and i know my mom will call me those things then at that point its on me right i lowkey deserve it at that point also is it abuse to say you deserve to be beat if she said it only once or when i expressed suicidal thoughts once she told me to get on with it other than these things my mom is fine considering the pain she herself goes through with scoliosis like maybe im a bad daughter she always tells me i dont do anything around the house and i tell her to give me a list of chores because she never has and she tells me to offer to do chores but when i do she says nobut then she says i never offer sorry im rambling now my point is is she abusive at all or is it my fault
my dads birthday was this wednesday and i gave him a candle my mom bought for me and a store bought card im i dont have any money rn he is yelling at me and is saying i suck at everything and makes his life worse
im honestly shocked so my mom and dad have been arguing again nothing new they used to be a lot worse and i would always involve myself i would always try to come to the rescue for my mom and she would always tell me not to involve myself i used to absolutely hate my dad and my mom would tell me he is still your dad i would basically fight my moms battles and for years i have always tried to be the peacemaker or the mediator i am also the eldest by the way however i realized it was truly never my battle to fight i am just their child and they are the adults who should know better so recently my mom has developed a pattern whenever her and my dad are on bad terms suddenly my siblings and i are the worst people on earth too she randomly started talking about how she is treated so badly and that others being me and my siblings see and do nothing she said and they are just as guilty you are actually an accomplice i was so shocked how can you call your child an accomplice in something they have no control over and also keeping in mind that she was the same person who said we shouldnt pick sides and that my dad is still my dad it seems that she doesnt like my relationship with my dad she always tries to make me feel guilty over things that have nothing to do with mei have no control over

trigger warning so i just moved out of college there has been many fights between me and my parents about move out i kept asking for months hey how are we going to move out and then they just ignored me they also kept telling me they would figure it out i even tried to plan out a really good way to move out and i already had everything in motion but they called and cancelled all of it fast forward until two days until move out and they send me a condescending text saying that because of my poor planing i need to sell all my stuff and get rid of my pet to move out i of course told them there was no damn way i would eve do that and reminded them that i kept telling them we needed to plan for move out they just kept insisting that i have to get rid of my pet for context behind this next but my dad was involved in a really bad divorce between him and his ex wife during that he quite literally through me in the middle and let his ex steal my identity and cancel all financial aid i had and ruin my credit score he also let his ex take everything i had and hold it for ransom i know this probably sounds overdramatic but when i say i have nothing i have nothing i told him that my pet was the one thing i had left on this planet then one thing that cared for me this went on back and forth for a while until he sent me a final text in it he basically explained that ive always been a burden to him and that i have never sacrificed anything for him he said i was extremely selfish and he would move me out this summer but the would not be taking me for any breaks over next school year he also said he would be taking my pet and would not let me have it back over the fall he then blocked me today when my mom picked me up it was a even bigger shit show she kept implying she may not show up and that she was well within her rights to not show up she kept texting me demanding i apologize or else shell leave me homeless causing me to get really stressed and to selfh again to try and dull out the stress and pain from the situation i told her that i tried to plan something out before but they canceled that plan i also tried to call my grandmother for help and she just told me i should be more considerate of my moms feelings and that once again ive never had to loose anything before she also knows i lost everything to my dads ex my mom then threw in a bunch of threats and told me to be prepared to jump in the car and leave as fast as possible which i was fine with when she arrived she shut off the ac and told me i didnt get those privileges any more she then rolled down all the back windows where i was sitting and turned the radio to its highest setting playing the loudest songs possible keep in mind this wasnt a short drive so for hours on the interstate we drove with windows down and radios blasting i tried to nap and i kid you not she swerved the car near a ditch and turned around when i shot up and said you do not get to sleep because you made me drive all the way out here i know if i tried to go back to sleep or talk back she would actually drive us into that ditch im worried being back at the house its going to be an all out crap show im always a scape goat and i know that they will find every little thing to blame me for i also suffer from pretty bad depression and im worried it may drive me into doing something not good its already caused me to heavily think about it i know the wise thing to do is to not stay and leave the house but i have no friends or other family if i leave i will be homeless with no money to my name after the court case i just dont know what to do and i really dont think i can survive the whole summer if this is already where we are at
i was wondering if anyone else who had an abusive childhood is experiencing some of the symptoms i am i have symptoms of fibromyalgia and joint pain also my glutes are really really sore to the touch it feels like bee stings i used to get beat as a child as a form of punishment and it just would turn to violence the bee stings when i touch my glutes or when my husband touches my glutes reminds me of the same feeling i used to feel when getting beat my whole body used to be sore to the touch and achy but now its getting better my glutes are horrible though anyone else experiencing this

my father has been abusive to my mom and my brother since forever my brother moved out a few years ago and recently he has been physically and verbally abusive to me whenever i try to protect my mother from being beaten and abused i cant seem to forgive him no matter what this morning he was admitted to the hospital and turns out his condition is severe but i dont feel the least bit of sympathy for him although i feel a little guilty for not being sympathetic towards him today but i dont know if its alright to not forgive him for all the torture and trauma he has passed on to me can somebody pls tell me whats wrong and whats right
i hate my mum and i cant wait until i have enough money to move you sorry if grammar is bad im writing this at work and sorry its so long disclaimer i know i dont have it nearly as bad as some people but im just frustrated im an yr old female and my mum is the most insufferable person ive ever met she wasnt always like this in fact we were quite close when i was little but as ive grown older i feel like shes trying to control me and hates that im independent so shes horrible to me the breaking point was today when i was sitting down doing school work im in uni study a very intensive double degree she comes up to me and says is it too much to ask you to go to the grocery shop i explain to her im doing work and she tells me to go in minutes then i explain to her that im doing a timed assessment that is due today and opened today so i need to do it and cant stop because ill run out of time so shes scoffed at me and goes i used to go to the shop for you as a kid why do i even bother with you so while she was in the shower i go talk to my dad about how shes being to me and she swings the door to my dads office open and says to me bitching today about me then proceeds to tell me i should of just gone to the shop and not been such a brat when i was younger one of my most memorable things is that when i was maybe she would force me to pull down my pants and show her my vagina and because it didnt look like hers i was obviously still growing and barley hit pubity she would always laugh and tell me it wasnt normal over the years ive wrote down in my notes stuff shes done so ill list some here i was unpacking the groceries and i told her the drinks wouldnt fit in the fridge and she replied yelling op dont be an obnoxious brat she asked me to buy her a juice after work so i did and i bring it to her and she yells at me saying she didnt want it and then she called me selfish she told me to clean out the fridge and i was then she goes into the kitchen and slams the fridge door shut it was open and i was in between the fridge and the door because i was cleaning and i tell her she hit me and she immediately told me i was being a drama queen and took my phone off me then called me a smart as i got broken up with and was upset so i want to talk to her and she told me to go away because she was tired so i went into the bathroom to shower and closed the door and she screamed op slam that door and ill slame your face into it i didnt slam it when i was she found out i was r and refused to talk to me for a week because i wasnt a virgin other things she does include calling me a selfish bitch or a cow calling me fat and ugly making fun of what i wear and if i tell her something isnt right or i dont like something shes doing or ask her to apologise for anything shell say something like learn how to take a joke youre no fun guess i wont talk anymore then youre too sensitive
my mom will always make jokes about me being a dummy or being stupid and i hate it today she called me braindead and stupid times because apparently being cut off midsentence while explaining something makes me sound dumb shes the one who cut me off this has been going on since i was a baby with her saying she regrets having me and that she shouldve never had a kid its so annoying and i hate it when she calls me names but she just wont stop no matter how much i tell her to should i talk to my school counselor
i have older sisters and were years apart and ik theyve suffered too but i just see brothers protecting their younger siblings and im so fucking jealous i just wish they wouldve protected me from my dad hittingscreaming at me but at the same time i was really bad to my younger sister like i remember my friend slapping her really hard and when she told an adult i just said i didnt see anything and thats not even the only thing but its probably the worse i probably traumatized her or at least definitely made her childhood worse but i swear i really do regret it i apologised and we have a good relationship now but all of that just makes me think that i shouldnt want to be protected if i couldnt protect her yk i wish i had someone to protect me and i really wish i protected my sister too and im just so sorry about not being there for her when she was a kid but i was a kid too
ive posted a couple times other spots but ill post again here too im looking for more advice my parent will act confusing sometimes to me one minute they will be asking how my day was the next giving my little brother a nose bleed or one minute giving me a hug the next picking me up by my shirt whilst pinned against the wall and yelling at me it is annoying weird and puts me on edge i am at the point where i am anxious randomly all the time even at school people at school will make fun of me or laugh at me too which makes it even worse i need some way to express these emotions but i am isolated i am afraid all the time i have become much more numb to my emotions and find it even harder to form any bonds with people or care about them my behavior has also becoming increasingly more aggressive recently i actually hit my brother with a belt because i was angry at him and he responded with attacking me using a hanger help
i realy like walking around my room but my parrents tell me they will take my computer away i need it for school and i just dunno is this abusive
hi everyone f ive been coming to terms with how abusive my family has been my whole life this has not been helped since ive come out as transgender my ultimate goal is to be able to cut my family off financially im very lucky to be in the financial position im in ill be graduating college in december but until then my dad is helping pay for half of my rent and groceries and i am on his insurance im a type diabetic so i cant afford to lose the luxury of this assistance for anyone whos ever been in a situation of financial dependence how do you break away
she had me in shape weargirdles from th grade until high school like i was years old and she was actively asking me wheres your girdle before i left the house buying me waist trainers and giving me her old ones always talked about me dieting or being too big and only ever praised me when i lost weight quickly usually during depressive episodes i while in hs once wore a pair of pajama pants that were extra fluffly around the house after i had dropped some weight and when i walked past her she said you gained all that weight back while just shaking her head and looking disappointed although there was no way for her to know i was already feeling self conscious when she said it there was still no reason to say it at all i had just started to recover from my ed and that one comment made me lose my appetite for days im good now for the most part but she called and asked what she ever did to make me avoid her and that was the main thing on the list she refused to believe and i didnt want to full on argue about it but i didnt want to sit on it either
well i mostly iron their skin or burn them with my cigars besides ofc regular beatings any other things i should do to them
right when she gets home all my mom does is yell at me i cant deal with this i feel so hopeless and miserable im sobbing right now i dont know what i did to deserve this
please dont say anything rude i would like genuine advice so i am f and i am living with my ex m after moving in with him into a home my parents supposedly bought me they own it i have no lease my parents who are millionaires financially pay for my entire life and control almost every aspect of my life what job i can work what i go to school for and who i date and who i can bring to the house i was emotionally and physically abused by them as a child had distanced myself when i was and moved out last year they inherited millions and lured me back in with cheap rent in a huge house promises to be kind to me and when i did they threatened to evict me or call the police if i dont do something they want me to do especially if i dont keep constant contact with them my ex and i ended up getting really close to their friend group during this time my ex who is extremely violent behind closed doors and a compulsive liar and serial cheater hence why i am leaving him but extremely charming to others has convinced everyone that i am insane or my parents have im not sure my ex and parents have an extremely close relationship as well they bought him a car they financially support his life i told my parents and ex i wanted to leave him and i wanted my ex to move out of the house they bought me and my parents have cussed me out everyday since and even threaten to call the police to have me evicted from the home so that my ex can live there instead of me they tell me im crazy and no one will ever love me except him my ex has been hanging out with my parents friends well and the speaking about me constantly and they all came up with the conclusion i am having a nervous breakdown because its not rational to want to leave him i guess when i try to explain my side no one listens and they started sending me therapy links i stopped hanging around them all and my ex god to my family dinners without me i started seeing another guy in hopes that my ex will leave the home on his own and now he is just telling everyone we are not broken up and i am cheating on him i went to the psychiatrist yesterday and she told me im not crazy and im acting exceptionally well despite the circumstances of what is going on
why did they do all of that to me did i really deserve all of that im trying my best and im never good enough for them im so desperate for validation that ill never get
being forced to strip naked and being smacked on ur ass repeatedly my mom would do this to me and take me to the basement so the neighbours wouldnt hear me scream for help and me begging her to stop
before i start writing i feel like im about to tell some sort of horror story because theres just crazy amounts of stuff that happened but basically when i was younger my mum re married and he physically abused me for years of my life till i was and i was in hospital from a injury its something ill never understand but i know how fucked up it is whats more fugged up is how my mum stayed married to him and never seemed to be there to defend child me and shes still married to him i was taken out of her custody after this event and eventually saw her again but when i was she stopped contacting me i later found out that she had a mental breakdown and also lost custody of my brother thats a whole different story what has brought this up in my mind is that her husband the guy who hurt me is now starting to hurt her with his mental abuses and all sorts of narcisstic tactics im now and she has told me that she is going to leave him after all these years of her trying to make me and him have a relationship again this all sounds so fucked up right because it is fucked up what im trying to get some sort of help with is what do i now shes coming to me trying to get me to help with her with legal stuff and honestly i have no sympathy anymore i half hate her and half dont understand how you could be like this to me my whole life im expecting my first child any day now and she wants in on everything but im just done with the toxic environment i grew up in what would you do my problem is i cant cut people off for shit
okay so i am years old every time my mom wakes me up on the weekends she always starts yelling at me for no reason and beats me up recently my mom got mad at me for not drinking my medicine so she punched my eye which almost popped it out this has been going on my entire life i sometimes feel like killing myself once me and my mom went to do the laundry and i was packing our clothes and she got mad that i wasnt doing it fast enough and she beat me in public other people in the store told her to stop and they kicked her out the store she got so mad that when i got home she beat me until my butt was bleeding and i begged and she wouldnt stop she finally stopped when her friend called her whenever i missed the bus because my mom would chase me around the house with a hanger and beat me she gets mad and blames me and doesnt take me to school that day and makes me put my hands up like a slave on the wall and if i dont she will beat me she always cursed at me like when i talk for example if i said something she would tell me to shut the f up she always blames stuff that happens even if i didnt do it she gets mad if i forget to close the bathroom door and slaps me and whenever its a school night she doesnt even care if i sleep late or not she forces me to stay up to help her clean her bowls which takes forever and if i complain she beats me she even beat me when i was only years old i once was and she gave me rice and some soup i didnt like so i told her i didnt want it so she beat me up with a stick until i begged for mercy and ate the whole thing i sometimes pray to god to die because of how she treats me
hello everyone ill l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of whats up i just need peoples views on wether this is normal or not or not that bad or fucked up or whatever but i need either the dismissal for this not being that bad or validation so i dont feel guilty for how i feel its also weirdly empowering instead of victimizing when i acknowledge that the things im going to describe speak poorly of them and that i can see that i dont feel like bringing this up to my friends before laying it out id like to get another thing off my chest i feel like im misleading you because im not mentioning much of the stuff i did wrong but i never put my family in danger nothing close to that that is the only reason for hitting someone that i could justify but i was still made to feel like the things i did where very bad also feeling guilty because its not the typical abusive household where im getting punished for no reason its a loving place im aso conflicted because this person has a reputation as a very dependable friend and also he is not egotistical but idk still this doesnt sit right with me im family is from eastern europe sovietish culture immigrated to argentina in thats when i was born my life up until yo i dont remember anything basically so all of this is what ive been told father lied a lot and was hysterical when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes my mother always put me in another room so i wouldnt witness that when i was i was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out dad wanted me to stop i didnt so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door at some point during this period up until yo he said that i should fear him like an animal he never laid a hand on me but had outbursts when im mom divorces him so after that ive always lived with my mom grandparents and uncle all maternal up until not long ago when my uncle got married and moved to their own place visits weekly dad left the country years later when i was and before that hed pick me up times a year im told i wasnt really sad when he left btw he was paranoid and passed his conspiracy theories on to me musicians are evil freemasons the number everywhere that kinda thing once at like yo in the shower i broke down and called my mom to talk because i couldnt handle all the badmouthing that my father was talking about them my family i went down the conspiracy rabbit hole a few years ago when i was and luckily snapped out of it so after they divorced my uncle became some kind of father figure which i guess was even more so when my actual father left the country from this point onwards there has been quite a number of experiences which i feel have conditioned me ill share a few representative examples we were all having dinner and for some reason when my uncle stopped talking i told him to shut up in our language it had a more insulting wording but not like shut the fuck up the response was an immediate and silent slap on the cheekmouth from his part this was some months later im sitting on my bed reading with some water and chocolate snacks uncle comes in says we are eating soon so dont eat any more chocolate when he came back to call me to dinner he sees i ate all the chocolate takes the water bottle and empties it on my head it was at keast half full because i remember even the matress soaking on the part i was sitting he told me to stay there so i couldnt change and even had to sleep on that matress idk how this would make you feel but for me its a good example of the humiliation anger shame and whatnot that i felt with some frequency from his actions given that he had no problem being aggressive towards me i always felt intimidated afraid so i didnt express those emotions and swallowed them all repressing at most id cry silently for a bit or go the bathroom and cry angrily at the mirror silently of course for a moment and stopped it so this is an example thats easy for somebody reading this to see as humiliating angering etc he would do something like that once a month or twice a week depending on my behavior times it was something small unlike the example i gave which is obvious to anyone but those small things would also fill me with tears shame and whatever and like i said there was a frequency to it maybe it was misbehavior at school or half assing some chore and hed say something sometimes normally sometimes not so much so something like flicking me on the forehead or pulling my ear a bit was probably small for everybody but to me felt similar to the water bottle situation this continued until i was around wed still laugh play fight and those things the negative situations were a small portion of the time we spent together but the influence of his skewed methods was evident i was violent with my friends at school like id twist their arm so they would admit im right or something or making them flinch i was never a bully mind you all of this was normal playing for me i would have probably harmed myself before making somebody suffer for amusement or anything once i was with my uncle waiting in line for something and just decided to step with all of my strength on his foottoed it was a stomp and really painful bevause his shoewear was very thing on the top part no notable reaction from his part just disbelief as in whats wrong with you when i was i lied big time for the first time ever i skipped class and didnt give my parents the schools note inviting them to a meeting lol to notify them lol and when found out i was grounded like this i could only do boring tasks like transcription practicing calligraphy or reading an encyclopedia and also nobody talked to me for two weeks until my birthday where i was so happy for them to finally smile at me for this family lying is a big thing in case you havent noticed its a joking comment but also serious they were very big on me telling the truth i fail high school like three or four times i just wanted to be on my phone all day jerking off eating junk food drinking coca cola etc when i was i guess studying for a subject i had to pass to pass the year my parents mon and uncle wanted to make sure i studied so he controlled the process i went to my room to study and just grabbed the phone after hours uncle comes in and starts testing what i should have studied i dont answer im getting very anxious like i am now just typing this out in my belly which always happened when i knew he would get angry after finding out about something i did wrong and he understood what i had been doing so he takes my phone puts it on the floor grabs a thermos i had laying around and holds it above my phone looking at me and asking me what was i really doing he was barely containing his temper his nostrils were flaring i swore i just couldnt study or concentrate so hed spare the phone something similar happened at some point where he did the same but holding it outside the window like hed drop it some years later id be again failing the year so i had to pass on the subjects i owed to make it simple there was an option where i could choose between a hard exam and an easy one he said i should do the hard one of course i agreed but later i took the easy one we were in my room when he found out he went silent and kicked me really hard on the side of the leg where it hits a nerve or smt he came up to my face and i instinctively covered my belly he saw this and told me i shouldnt protect myself from him that this was all due to my decisions or whatever not long after that i guess i failed again or lied about school or smt and he hit me on the face because i was driving my mom crazy which is partially true btw i was really stressing her out i was lying to her every year telling her i was studying and that i was passing my exams around this time i was hanging out at a friends place and some movement he did made me flinch something that had never happened with him it wasnt even a sudden motion haha i felt so anxious and ashamed god at some point he was done with me after i once more showed no cooperation with his help literally he said hed be there for whats needed like hes not pretending i dont exist but like our friendly relationship was over basically for lying eventually i apologized and we had a long conversation what he said boiled down to ill really try but itll be hard to rebuild trust you cant mess up you understand this time there will be no coming back from that one mind you this was a very serene reasonable conversation we were very calm and mature btw this happened one or two more times like the falling out and me apologizing after my mom would pressure me because there was tension when he and i were in the same room cuz wed barely talk and if i asked smt indirectly to him hed be short disinterested or didnt say anything anyway im now he hasnt put a hand on me since that last time i mentioned of course still an intimidating man strong control issues constantly needs to prove to you that he is right very irritable oh and some months ago i brought up the subject mentioning how i dont know how it would turn this time out if he were to hit me now that im he said calmly im still capable of turning you into a handicapped person now a disclaimer while on the emotional level theres tons of fear resentment and anger towards him cognitively i know where he was coming from im not saying it was right im saying that we all carry around a psychological shadow the subconscious repressed emotions or whatever term its not that they dont know the importance of working on this and letting these things out they dont even think theres anything wrong ive brought this up to my mom a few times and once to my uncle he just said he did what he had to do and that my reactions to that were my problem to put it succinctly no apology my mom wasnt very fond of him slapping or hitting me but also didnt see the emotional damage he thinks he had to do it but i know that in reality he was and is carrying around a lot of anger and some other bullshit and justifying their expression through rationalization you were driving your mom mad you did things contrary to our agreement for the tenth time etc im actually glad that his logical mind is apparently above average because otherwise he would have rationalized hitting me for every fucking thing lol i was also told to basically stop victimizing myself he is like this but since he doesnt go around flipping out on everybody nor did he do anything to me unjustified he was never stopped i believe much of the repressed resentment and anger towards the rest of my family is because this all happened in front of their noses but was deemed normal or appropriate so as i said on the mental aspect i know theres no point in looking for guilty ones but emotionally i want to hit him and tell him to go fuck himself when i dont distract myself with the phone or any activity some emotions come to attention i may even cry for a second this makes me happy since it makes me confident in their natural release mechanism which i only have to let work by unclenching muscles releasing mental tension just relaxing and letting myself feel everything ive supressed for so long i feel no ill emotion towards my actual father but maybe thats buried even deeper also im anxious about the moment i let go of something and cry my heart out and my mom or grandma being concerned for me like i cant make something up and but also the truth would be impossible to accept or incomprehensible or theyd just assume i was projecting the trauma from my biological father on my uncle lol sad but ill just let go at some point and thats it ive stopped expressing my concern about this situation to anybody in the family its not wise to need their understanding even if its family ive come to realize that my social anxiety awkwardness emotional coldness towards family i cringe at the thought of being vulnerable or show some emotion gosh my grandma is severely ill and i struggle to be compassion like i know its there somewhere i can feel it sometimes but theres so much repressed bs covering it up irritability towards family and many other things are a result of this this is good news for me because i now know its not just random but a result of the minds shadow

im currently a f the oldest daughter of the household has a younger brother that is currently in high school and i have a rather difficult and unstable relationship with my mother however even though our relationship has been toxic for as long as i can remember that doesnt stop me from wanting to have a good relationship with her there was a time where two years ago i wanted to cut off all contact and go no contact because i figured that was the best for me at the time but flash forward to now i realized that i felt guilty for wanting to go no contact and am now trying to repair the broken relationship im not sure whether its my inner child talking or the oldest sibling trauma bond that ties me close to her or if deep down i really truly want to have a relationship with her just to give some background information both my parents are in a loveless marriage but refuses to divorce and currently still lives in the same household i am no longer living with them but i still live rather close i would say my current relationship with my mom is a little better than the relationship i had with her when i still lived at home i would say it was more so physically abusive where she would throw silverware at me hit me and there was no sense of privacy at home since i am now no longer financially bound to her she cant do those things however that doesnt stop her being very emotionally abusive and mentally very draining she tends to be very jealous of my happiness in terms of wanting to hang out with my friends constantly projects her insecurities onto me since shes not in a happy marriage she tells me not to waste time on building romantic relationships or that friends doesnt matter as much as her since she does not have friends when i communicate to her that i want to be there emotionally for a friend or wants to spend time with a friend she questions why i am wasting my life and how no one will stay in my life forever and this leads me down into a downward spiral of anxiety believing no one will stay with me or put up with me because she drills the mindset that no one will want to put up with me that if i am a horrible daughter why would anyone else want me keep in mind i have always been a reasonable daughter i have always passed all my classes did well in school took care of my brother cooked for the family when my mom would go on vacation i was there emotionally for my mom when she wanted to talk was never judgemental and always tried my best to see her however her nagging and persistent guilt tripping never ceases she always picks at my appearance my weight claims that im a failure for not making enough that i am not focusing on myself enough theres so much more but on to the topic of this post just recently i was cleebrating my best friends birthday and was out at around pm for a painting session i was not on my phone but then took it out after i painted my mural and came to missed calls from my mom back to back i immediately got on the phone with her and told her where i was but she proceeded to guilt me for wasting time and claimed that i see my best friend more than i see her keep in mind that i try to see my mom as much as i can on average i see my mom at least three times a month she told me that all i do was waste time and then hung up on me when i was trying to explain myself that caused my mood to steadily shift and i wasnt able to enjoy myself she then proceeds to text me quite like sending texts exclaiming that i was still a child for not getting why she was calling so much when i was trying to explain to her that she was making me feel uncomfortable and that i was trying to enjoy my night without her guilting that led to her calling me immature and proceeds to not listen to me by that time i was fed up and then left the birthday celebration early because i felt too guilty for staying longer it just sucks because i feel like there are times my mom and i can seldom get along and have a good time but it just never lasts when i do have a good time with her it makes me disassociate and lowkey convinces me that none of it is real that she is only nice to get something from me that even if she is nice i can never fully be myself without feeling judged i do not feel comfortable with confiding in her about anything because her first response is always to judge me for my mistakes and never to comfort or guide me she is a ball of negativity and i can never feel truly at ease she can be very volatile with her words and actions and it is hard for me to predict what she will do next today i thought about doing therapy for the first time especially to bring her along with me for the journey i decided to research some therapists within our insurance network and thought to myself how she would take my idea so i decided to message her and ask whether she was willing to do therapy to fiximprove our relationship since she has told me various times when she was in a good mood that she wants to be closer to me she responds with what in a very judgemental way and i proceeded to explain to her that i think it would be good for our relationship and for both of us individually to be able to emotionally connect and bond and she has not responded to me it has been a full day and it is abnormal for her to not respond usually when she is like this she does not agree with my ideas and refuses to communicate im not sure if it is even worth for me to try to convince her that therapy can be a good idea if that was her initial reaction i feel as if my whole life i have to beg her or reason with her a thousand times to get her to see from my perspective she is an extremely stubborn selfish woman with possibly undiagnosed narcissism and im not sure if i should even try im very mentally drained to the point of giving up and not even trying anymore on our relationship because it just feels like nothing is changing any kind of thoughts or commentary would help i would really appreciate it
long post im writing this to vent for acknowledgment and to possibly ask some questions but mainly for venting because i feel so alone regarding this ill l share the things that feel the most relevant so you get some general idea of whats up im family is from eastern europe sovietish culture immigrated to argentina in thats when i was born my life up until yo i dont remember anything basically so all of this is what ive been told father lied a lot and was hysterical when arguing with mom he would sometimes tear his clothes apart or smash dishes my mother always put me in another room so i wouldnt witness that when i was i was playing with the remote control taking the batteries out dad wanted me to stop i didnt so he left me in the dark bedroom and closed the door at some point during

abusive household i dont have alot of freedom and i dont know how to really be independent as parents have always took control over everything in my life what do i need to prepare whatever the cost is ill try my best to earn it what are some expenses ill need to keep in mind im currently saving up
my parents were barely present for me growing up and when they actually here the only attention i got from them was them yelling at me and being upset now in people i have attraction too its always cold and dismissive people emotionally unavailable people that dont properly love me im always chasing after their validation its like a high for me i dont like people that care for me too much that are emotional and too loving i hate that im like this ill never be happy even if i get away from my parentd they have affected my future relationships and ill always have this trauma
my parents are abusive and theres been times where i wanna call the cops on them but they hold evidence against me so i cant do anythinng i forged my moms signature to try to open a bank account since my parents wont help me make one myself and at the time i thought iy would be a good idea i had a meltdown one time and threw something at my mom i have bad anger issues and my parents were aggrivting me on purpose my dad recorded it and i ran to the basement they were sil recording me and my mom got on me and was holding me down i was having a panic atyaxk and i was begging her to let go and i was overstimuated i tried yo push me off and she wouldnt so i started to pull her hair and bite her as hard as i could then my dad got a glass of cold water and threw it on me i feel pressured into being silenced i cant get help i usually never get agressive woth my parents but being abusived for years i snapped i hold np evidence against my parents so theyll always have something against me im so scared of them
does anyone else have a hard time recalling traumatic events sometimes i wanna vent about how abusive my parents are but then ill forget what theyve done i know theyve done some horrible things tp me but its hard remembering specifically what because i camt remember it makes me feel like its not a big deal on whatever yhe fuck they did to me
hi this is my first time in reddit anyways to keep it short my parents refused to let me inter university of my choice even though its free and forced me into the nearer college where there is like major or something like that and none of them was for me none of them was even the choice number five on my list i really tried to get into it and continue my life but i simply couldnt i couldnt study something i will never get a job with there is no jobs for me with this major so whats the point this drove me into depression more i have no future career i have a hobby which i want to develop into business but the stress from the college and my parents cant let me do anything its started to affect me physically panic attacks throwing up severe insomnia and others my parents are controlling and dont really about what anyone want hell even they dont want anything they never wanted me to be successful at all they prevented me from getting any kind of job through high school i am broke i cant even get out i am trying to make some money online but as i said stress and anxiety are eating me alive what should i do my father doesnt care that much about me going to college because either way he wont give me a penny nothing new there the problem is my mom she skipped college because of my father and my father in short is and emotionally abusive and a narcissist who mad my mothers life hell she is obsessed over college because she thinks her life would better with a degree but i know that a degree wouldnt help her leaving my father years ago so its irrelevant
thats all i can label this as right now i am currently a f with sisters moved out and one doesnt live with me so im not counting them that means there are sisters that live with me now i didnt realize this before but my mom is a major bully i shouldve realized it from middle school when my mom read my diary she sat me down to make me watch her read it and continued to make me sit while she told me why my thoughts were wrong she also does this thing when she tells us to do something that we dont quickly do or we dont understand she talks in a way that makes us seem retarded and says because this is the only way i can make you understand my sisters encourage it by laughing but i dont think thats very funny probably because ive been called stupid twice by her and ignorant once shes also made me feel like im ungrateful i probably am i have so many electronics from her a phone a laptop a tv a tablet and she keeps food in our stomachs with a place to live but if i know one thing about manipulation its that people will do whatever it takes for you to let them keep treating you the way they are every time she and my dad would argue wed go somewhere fun like bowling or shed sit us down to talk about it and ask us how we felt she doesnt really care she has told me a lot that she doesnt care what i think that its disrespectful if i try to tell her why something isnt a good idea she would also go out of her way to explain to me her child btw whats going on with her situation with my dad why she hates him and why he doesnt care about us he does btw she also goes out to make it like somethings my fault when she couldve chosen an easier route im not comfortable talking about that story yet but she gaslights a lot i cry a lot im a pisces what can i say but when i do my mom calls me a crybaby remember when she read my diary afterward she asked me if i was done with my woe is me act but i feel like my act is a way better reaction than having temper tantrums like she does she once threw something at her bedroom door and it went into the kitchen and almost hit me not to mention the amount of times she slammed her door please dont tell me to talk to her about it because shes too stubborn even her own family sees it i cant bring in a trusted adult none of that and get this shes already in therapy i just hate this woman and i dont want to but i do i want to get out of here but i want to also protect my sisters from her all of them one of them is my half so my dad probably wont be able to take custody of her
hi today i needed to find the answer to my question are my parents abusive growing i always knew that i was different for one im short im and im ft so i was bullied for that and anytime i try to stand up for myself my dad would beat me with his belt and i guess i was the baby of the house i didnt really had to do anything which would eventually hurt my in the future so all of these things made me weak and introverted and i think growing up we were poor one time i remember that we could afford the electricity bill and me and my sisters had to give our money to our mom to pay it my and my brother didnt even have a console or anything like that because according to my dad its a waste of time i wasnt allowed to go over to other peoples houses because according to my dad i need to study but it was perfectly fine for him to take us to his friends houses i think his beating went too far like for example he caught my older brother lets calling him tyler drawing on the walls and he beat him but one event that happened to me i will never forget one day after swim practice which i hated and got no say in my dad was cussing tyler out because i think he joked or threaten to shoot ip his middle school he was in th grade and i was in th grade i chuckled like and idoit until after i finished taking a shower when i heated my twin lets call her leah and came run to her i found out to tyler ran away and after hours we found him at the public pool i still remember that night eating food with the last fanta bottle and my sisters watching olympic swimmers it was traumatizing and i was afraid of getting beaten or getting in trouble so didnt tell my teachers or friends when i went during the summer i visited my cousins in spokane wa and after that i had to live i my parents other house because we couldnt afford to live in our original home so after weeks of sleeping and doing nothing because i didnt have a phone at the time but my sisters did because my mom had to find a way to communicate with us directly the school year started but then covid came in march and when we were released to spring break that break lasted the rest of the year even though we still had to do our work online in my th grade i was online till may to do my starr test online sucked and the teachers didnt really care about us online kids th grade year and i thought it would be different but i was wrong eventually my dad said we were moving to spokane and i was excited because it was a new start for me but when i left i winter break i barely got my old friends contacts and i have been trying to contact them ever since my new middle school was okay but i was very alone at the beginning then my freshman year rolled in and was okay oh i forgotten to mention that during my th grade year my older brother tyler to my older sister lets call her jackie if she wanted to sigh up for driving class because she as a sophomore at the time and refused this will be important later on so then my sophomore year came and it was okay at the start but it took a turn for the worst so took get money we would have to do the clothes for the patients my parents were working to take care of in fact we live above them in a basement thats why we moved here but lately we have stoped doing them because our mother wouldnt pay us on time so after weeks of this my mother came downstairs with a broom to beat my sisters and i had enough even though tyler was across from my mom i had to go and stop her and to still her to leave then my twin leah was bruised on the hand my older sister left the house for safety with my cousins and after weeks of her staying with them she came back during our spring break at the end of it in april i had to go stay upstairs to watch the patients but i had to go for my hair cut with tyler so it was leah or jamie and it couldnt really be leah because she had stayed up their for any hour but jamie could do it because she had to go out with her friend this is get too long but i will com with apart two to this so stay tune update jamie and my mom had a huge argument jamie said that her friends moms always treat their daughters better than our mom does while either they are stay at home moms or they actually manage and be engaged with daughters to cook food for them i think one of the main reasons is because we live in an adult family home where the patients live with us so my dad and my have to take care of them hours a day she doesnt have time to cook us dinner every night and the food that she does cook is for the patients which i do not eat because it used canned foods usually tyler cooks us dinner or we would have to manage on our own going back to the situation the argument escalated and my mom said if these friends moms were better than her then she should go live with them and thats what jamie did she packed some of her stuff and left when me and tyler came back me and him had no idea of the situation that happened mom was just saying how ungrateful jamie was and stuff then at around pm when i was on my phone leah came up to me to whisper that jamie was not coming back then my dad came to leah and jamie room to interrogate leah on the whereabouts of my sister which she didnt know dad then called jamie with leah phone saying you need to return now but jamie refused that night i could barely sleep because i didnt know how to process this situation what about school in days following the event i was scared that my parents will forcefully take my sister back at lunch where half the school is to each lunch i cant describe the anxiety that came so i talk to my world history about this and he had is suspicions on what was going on because jamie was acting strange in his class but when didnt have time to talk and suggest to go to the counselor office i did and talked with my th and th grade counselor and they really helped me after a couple of weeks they successfully got me sister back after wanting to ask the police to label her as a runaway honesty looking back on it now both sides to blame my parents for not wanting to talk it out they have a it our way or no way attitude one of the main reasons of jamie running is because of the lack of space in the house like i said we live in an adult family home where patients live they all have either room to themselves with an exemption but we live downstairs which is a weird living room basement hybrid they are only rooms downstairs one for my parents and one of my sisters me and tyler have no room and live in the living room it sucks because there is no privacy worse there is also a kitchen here and people can just walk in uninvited in my space so when ever i want to jack off i have to do it under my blanket and my parents what i do under my blanket as if i making cocaine under their when im just a hormonal teenager it is a nightmare living here when we first moved i thought we just be staying here for a couple of months until we bought another house to live in we actually did although that house was still going to be an adult family home the space downstairs was nice but only had bedrooms but i was still happy it a massive living room downstairs which could install a lock making it my own room but of course life could never be that easy we later found out that my parents were going to rent out the rooms for money even though we moved all of our stuff in the garage words cannot describe how shocking and devastating this news was of all the times to have privacy being a teenager had to be the most important it is also a reason i havent bring any friends to my house because im embarrassed of the patients and how unclean the house is even if it was clean there is no room to do anything everything has been okay recently but i truly wish for things to get better sometimes i look at the stars at night saying to myself when i become famous to never forget where i came from where a hormaonal teenager had to with sever paitents that need a lot of care with no room to myself and my parents being fucking bitches more updates in the future will come so stay tuned
i broke a lamp i was joking with my mother and i extended my arm to emphise something and knocked over a lamp my mom kneeled next to it and was about to start screaming at me i took my phone water shoes and left the house immediately i forgot my earphones though so thats sad this has happend a lot it slowed down a lot more recently but eh guess some things never do change so im just outside its am and i just feel empty i always do during these sorts of things its easier that way i dont feel regret i dont really feel afraid i feel midly disguisted with myself thst i bothered my friend for comfort im pretty sure this is dissociation and i dont know im bored i cant listen to music i mean i could but i dont ant to bother the other tenets here someone got shot and robbed yesterday so this probably isnt safe just looking to chat i guess in thr comments no dms
ever since i could remember ive hated my life my sisters are spoiled and crazy to say the least they would always get their way with my mother my father was always working somewhere so he had no idea about this at the time and my brothers would always go with him because they were old enough so it would always be my abusive part of the family and yo me my mom hated me hated taking care of me hated my voice everything she would often hit me for the littlest things and every single time all i would see is her fist before getting whacked in the head i often was just left shaking and crying alone she was abusive physically and mentally often bringing me down when i accomplished something or calling me a mistake she would often encourage my sisters to do also which only hurt me worse after a year of that same process about everyday my parents started having problems my mom was having an affair with a guy who i will call pedro you see pedro was a guy who essentially drove my family to shredding its self to pieces he alone remains the one human who i want to cause brain trauma to with my fists alone he was fucking my mom without my dad knowing for about a year once my dad found out he was devastated this devested me as my dad was and still is a really good person seeing him cry hit my heart harder than a bullet pedro encouraged my mother to hit my dad as she hit me which she did and my father being the good person he is never hit her back he just avoided any physical problems from her this was when she tried to get lethal with him and almost killed us in the process she also began hitting me more and also started on my other brothers my sisters ofcourse joined in for a few weeks i endured this until i snapped at my two sisters i beat the shot out of then i was and them being and and since im naturally really strong i ended up breaking their noses and busting one of their lips my mom was not happy she cursed at me grabbed a metal rod and whacked me in the jaw breaking a lot of my teeth and drawing out a ton of blood about an hour later my dad came home and he saw my bloody mess of a face and he finally realized what my mom does to us we never told him due to fear he started yelling at my mom to the point in which she grabbed that same rod and tried to whack him in the head full force he had to run out since she could and would kill him if he didnt he essentially had to go hide out for about a day in his truck in fear for his life my mom later began packing her things and literally dragged my brothers and me to the car dropping us off on some dark alley in the middle of the night just so she can prove a point to my dad that she is not playing after she essentially abandoned us probably heading to pedros place our dad ended up finding us we told him everything and he was again devastated from the fact that she abandoned us and went with that piece of shit of a human pedro when went home our sisters were nowhere to be seen meaning that they went with her but the worst thing is that they trashed our house destroyed everything and threatened us with even worse it was so bad that we had to get legal and since we were not financially stable we could not afford a lawyer till then end of this legal battle which lasted years and since we had no evidence the cops could not do nothing no dna no cameras nothing so for about months our dad had to stay home without working just to raise us by this point i was after those months ended we heard glass shatter in a lot of windows and i recognized the people they were my mothers friends who were gangsters or just bad people the first thing they did is break the only phone that we had so we could not record nor call the cops they then demanded for us to go with them essentially a kidnapping scenario but because they caused such a ruckus our neighbor who ill call juan came out with a shotgun threatening them and scaring them off he then called the cops and some of them got arrested and they asked us to share details to them so we told them who they were sent by my mom so ofc they went and interegated her which she had her family alibi her along with her friends and some co workers ending up with an unsolved case so all we could do now is just save up money and plead in court years later when i turned we testified in court and we ended up getting re compensated k in damage and my dad got full custody of me and my brothers while my mom with my sisters and for a year we lived in piece when i turned we my dad and brother and me were evicted from out house we would remain homeless for about another year till we managed to rebt out a beat up old home to maintain us as we stay financially in trouble i later am forced to work for anything fixing cars selling candy at school lawn mowing etc selling candy was the best for me as i was a good negotiator which helped with rent just barely enough to get by and years later we still are financially struggling but now i get to feel what an average boy my age feels and ive never been so happy while my mom gets abused now by that mf pedro which is deserved but still angers me but ill let them settle it its sad that years of my life were completely shit but on the bright side im stronger physically and mentally and i will get money and i will help my dad out get his dreams when im older get him a truck or buy him a nice house in the coast as he always dreamed of mark my words note im now and am now for the first time in my life have friends note i still love my mom and my sisters note my sisters are a lot calmer now but they do drugs which is retarded but it their life now note my dads side of the family lives in my home country honduras which is why they were not involved if they were things would have ended up way better final note i left out a lot of things some are worse than this but those are things that are really personal thank you for your time and goodnight
if i write on the windows of my car and my mother wipes it off is that considered vandalism i own the car i bought it ten years ago with my ex husband and she has zero connection to the vehicle other than it was in her driveway
tw family abuse suicide summary sick of supporting my mum when all she does is complain and put me and my child at risk it has been nearly years since my mum has pulled me into her dv situation emotional coercive financial abuse most recently she tried to od this week because of my dads abuse and i supported her for a few days at my place after she was released from emergency im feeling really frustrated sad and disappointed because the help i have been giving her was thrown back into my face over the last two days specifically i helped get her a counsellor appointment and secure her bankingphoneemail as my dad has all her passwords she forgot her phone code and went off at me she was the one that set it she then went on and on about how im adding more fuel to the fire by making her do stuff i wasnt i was working and im just causing her more problems and not giving her space to think ive taken time off work to help her ive spent hours collecting evidence for her when she asked and ive been getting advice and helplines and provided her phone numbers shes the one that has been running around doing stuff like talking to my dad and the other women telling me whats going on constantly and wanting to talk trying to go back to work the day after being in emergency i feel bad saying this but i told her im done because all she does is blame me its been years and shes following the same pattern where i get all the blame and become the blacksheep plus i found out she had been betraying my trust and giving my dad access to personal info like my address and pictures of my kid when i expressly asked her not to because im no contact dad abused me too am i a terrible person has anyone felt the same or can empathise
i was abused by my parents grandma and family friends from childhood to adulthood it was awful and painful experience there are more details about what happened like i was told that you are stupid nothing and other negative words and actions i didnt even realized how fucked up until when i was older and went to therapy for that it was not normal at all it wasnt my fault for what happened about it thank you so much for listening and texting with this it means a lot to me
to preface two things im not suggesting this itself is abuse i just think its telling about his mindset the abuse i suffered was mostly emotional and verbal and definitely compared to some of the other people here much more mild it still scarred me heavily though but that doesnt mean im not aware that many people have experienced way worse anyway that out of the way i was working with my father on something and it made me start to notice something he uses the word perfect more than anyone else ive ever known like every time he would do something he would do it very carefully and when he was finished he would talk about how it was perfect if i screwed up in any way he would get angry and insult me and at one point yelled at me that i cant do anything right when i briefly dropped a nail i was supposed to hand him i know that i as a person have kind of an obsession with doing everything perfectly and being perfect basically im extremely perfectionist its one of the reasons i have body dysmorphia because i cant stand being anything but beautiful anything less is not good enough and its part of why i have performance anxiety and struggled emotionally to get through college because if i didnt get perfect grades i would hate myself and want to die and you know i guess i just see a connection between these two things my father would constantly talk about perfection using that word and accept nothing less and yell at me or insult me if i screwed up in any way sometimes for like an hour straight and i cant accept being anything except perfect or doing anything not perfectly and i feel deeply worthless inside most of the time i guess being obsessed with perfection is not so strange when your father is constantly talking about it and yells at you for anything less this might seem obvious but im very much an adult and yet i only realized like a year ago exactly how much the guy uses that word or how it might have affected me and now that ive started noticing it i think about it every time he says it which is basically every time multiple times we work on anything together
we live in a very southern area kind of in the middle of nowhere to be honest and the only homeless shelter seems to not be an option for me my mom has gone back and forth a lot on whether or not she wants to kick me out but right now im going into this with the belief that she probably will she probably has undiagnosed bpd andor npd and cycles between abuse and lovebombing quite often she outed me as queer to my grandparents one of them watches farright nazi content online and has made their opinions very clear and i dont feel safe living with them im struggling mentally and ive come to the conclusion that i probably have pretty severe ocd although i dont feel safe telling my mom this as opening up about anything mental illness related has caused me to be emotionally and physically abused in the past i bring this up because social interaction is really fucking hard for me and the thought of trying to find a roommate or a job kinda stresses me out definitely moreso than it would with most people ive also been depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed most of the day which is seemingly furthering her resentment towards me im typing this on a backup cellphone that my mom doesnt seem to know about i have to keep this phone either under my pillow my bed or in one of my shoes to prevent her from finding it she took my regular phone after finding out i was extensively researching abuse and housing options she told me word for word that she knows im trying to escape and she wont make it easy on me i have maybe people who i could imagine staying with for a while but its realistically not very likely getting an online job or doing something of that sort just isnt possible as my mom took the keyboard to my computer theres really no other family that i can think of and i dont have very many friends nearby i have around bucks in my wallet at the moment but thats it i had a job but she made me quit because she didnt want to make it easy for me to escape shes mentioned me getting another job a few days ago but i dont know when that would be again i want to really clarify this we live in a very southern town with very few shelters or job opportunities i also do not have a drivers license or any kind of way to really travel public transport isnt really a thing here any kind of advice would be wonderful ill clarify anything in the comments if i need to edit i have a ldr partner and we do plan to move in together at some point but that might not be for a while due to a variety of different reasons
u know when someone says my parents taught me thisthat etc well my parents didnt teav me anything
lmao tf you gonna rot like meat lmao

i get told im defensive constantly for years i get told i dont listen and that i shut down but then for example my mom reads off the label of a supplement im supposed to be taking and gets concerned that itll interact with what ive already got i try to assure her that i dont think my doctor would prescribe that to me if that was a major risk its not i just looked it up she reads off my regular meds bottle anyway and says this also causes fatigue because she refuses to listen to me in general but especially in regards to whats actually causing the disabilities that i have one of the major ones being cfs even though i try to share information videos articles infographics etc i meekly tell her that i dont think its from that thats all i say but my reasoning is because ive been fatigued for over five years and just starting taking this medication last year and she just storms out of the room wordlessly and its not just the actions but how she does things shes extremely cold and severe and yet shes normal with my father and hes the same way i just i know this subreddit would understand better than any the feeling this causes just being made to wonder if youre insane or if youre actually acting out and being unreasonable but i pack myself into a box just to try to appease my parents and try to reduce the emotional abuse today was a really fucking horrible day im having a mental episode that my mom dismissed as me just needing to eat and take supplements and drink water if i try to express that i need more emotionally i get yelled at and told that they are emotionally supportive and if i contest that i get hit with the oh i guess were awful parents then card i screamed into my pillow today to try to feel better i try talking to friends about it but what can they do why would they want to listen
okay obviously im gonna hope this remains anonymous because he wont listen to me on talking to someone about getting help but i wanna know if theres anything legal that can be done here because weve run out of options i f have been dating my m boyfriend for about months now and his mom has gotten worse throughout the course of our relationship to sum things up as a whole its a lot anytime he has a job and makes his own money she comes up with any reason on why she doesnt like that job and forces him to quit so he cant keep a job or make his own money shes very very religious and forces him to go to church every sunday and also actively attempts to force him to join a youth group or else she says shell kick him out she makes him do all the household chores he basically cleans the whole house pick up and drop off his siblings to and from school etc hes in charge of making sure theyve eaten and done their homework and if any of his siblings get in trouble for doing anything hes blamed for not being a good influence or not watching them good enough as if hes the parent in the house she manipulates him and says hes manipulative and that all he does is take from her she fat shames him and will sometimes tell him that he eats too much of their food as a grown man and that hes only allowed to eat dinner or food hes bought himself once again has no money because she makes him quit every job and then she tells him that hes lazy and cant keep a job shes emotionally abusive she always has to be the victim she lies about him cursing and yelling at her which he never does hes always calm he had a good amount of money at one time that he was payed and she told him he had to put it in a savings account that only she has access to so he doesnt spend it all so he has no access to that money as of right now she kicks him out every few months for any reason she can find and leaves him to walk the streets alone at night knowing that he has nowhere to go when he was a minor shed kick him out then report him to the police as a runaway she tells him that she doesnt think he should have a girlfriend and gets really upset anytime he spends times with me she tells him that she doesnt care about him doing certain things but then when he does them shell turn around and scream at punish him she got on him forever about how he was lazy because he wasnt in school he graduated and then he got into college for film in which he was excited to meet new people and make friends and he went for one week before she made him switch to online so that he can be home to take care of his siblings and do chores shell take his phone anytime she gets annoyed or mad while hes waiting for calls about interviews or calls from his counselor causing him to miss important calls and lose opportunities on getting a job or doing good in school and shes currently moving him into a way smaller room that hell share with his brother that will barely fit both of them so that her boyfriend and his kids can move in and shes making him get rid of his computer because it wont fit the computer he does online college on she tells him that she cant stand the sight of him or the sound of his voice a specific example would be there is one time he broke down and opened up to her about how harmful shes being and how she makes him feel helpless and she said my stomach started hurting when you got in here and it just got worse as you kept talking and said she couldnt stand him and theres much much more hes might i add again obviously legally hes an adult and can move out at any time he wants but she literally makes it impossible for him to be able to get a car or keep a job in order to make money to leave he cant live with me because i still live with my mom as well and wont be able to move out until im done with cosmetology school is there a legal route we could take like theres absolutely no way he can grow and be independent as an adult because she guilts and manipulates him into staying ive run out of options on how to help him and hes reluctant to ask for outside help but im tired of seeing my boyfriend lose who he is and give up on life because of this abusive woman
my dad has a temper and my mom puts people down sometimes when my dad is really mad he gets physical once he pushed my yr old sister and kicked her tonight he slammed her by her throat into a barn then proceeded to throw her to the ground he is and a large man so obv it hurt her my parents say its discipline my mother lets it happen once throwing a brush at me and telling all sorts of hurtful things like your fault lose weight be smarter jus normal mother comments but when we ask abt what my dad does she said it is wrong but its just discipline is she right
i live with my grandparents my granddad keeps making very odd and sexual jokes towards me and sometimes even touching me it started off with him spanking me i felt so disgusted that i cried and slapped him in the head out of anger he immediately brushed it off saying that what i did was overreacting he doesnt ever do it with anyone else and about the sexual comments thing today we were talking and he brought up not liking the body wash he was using so i offered him some advice my granddad then told me to just wash him while he wore a speedo there were a lot more before this including him joking about me getting pregnant im btw he also has a quick temper my granddad grabbed my face im not over exaggerating this he physically grabbed my face pushing me backwards during a yelling match i live with him so there isnt much i can do
im about weeks pregnant when i told my mom she immediately was overbearing saying that she wants to be a part of my very first ultrasound i didnt think that was appropriate and wanted that moment for my partner and i am years old and i am pretty independent and make my own money but the thing is i sold my house about two years ago and my parents offered for me to live in a house that was on a business property that they owned they offered and i decided to take it and sell my house and save money regretting the situation anytime i disagree with my parents they immediately tried to say that they were going to kick me out and that i am ungrateful im extremely grateful that they let me live here free but i also pay utilities and everything else that needs to be paid to live but back to my ultrasound my mom flipped out and said that she doesnt want to go anywhere shes not wanted and made it about herself saying that my partner is manipulating me trying to cut her out which is not the case is it is the complete opposite it was my decision and i offered for her to come to the next one and she started saying very emotionally abusive things like saying that shes already experienced being a grandmother mind you she isnt actually a grandmother weve had a couple close friends have babies that she was a part of but they also didnt have supportive baby daddy my partner is the best partner through thick and thin my partner parents are amazing and are really great people and im pretty close with his mom she stopped by the house the other day to bring food and she stopped and talked to my dad saying that shes excited for the baby and she can help with the baby whenever when i approached my dad and asked what they talked about he went insane hes jealous that i have a relationship with his mom and not mine he was so aggressive i thought he was going to try and attack my partner and i had to threaten to call the police i was hysterical hyperventilating because how severe the situation was my parents think that i am the problem and spoiled and im completely in the wrong about the situation its like they think my child is prize possession and just because i live in a house that they let me live in that they can treat me however and i have to accept it its causing me severe distress and a lot of trauma of being emotionally abused my entire life my lease is up in june and my partner and i are trying to find a place to live but at this point ive threatened to get a restraining order if they come near me its crazy to me that they know im pregnant and cant be under all this emotional distress they are convinced that i am the problem

my mom is emotionally abusive and controlling i finally came clean about the fraud she committed and it has resulted in of my family not talking to me especially my sister and my cousin who is my best friend i dont know what to do at this point
hi everyone these last few weeks have been a real eye opener to my mothers manipulation i grew up in with a very abusive emotionally and physically mother and a father who did nothing to stop it we came from mexico when my mom married my father and he adopted us so up until a few years ago i always have carried this idea that my father was my hero because he rescued us on the flip side my mother has always been the devil she would constantly yell at us saying we werent good enough we were shitty kids and that we should be embarrassed because we were wastes of money and time at one point growing up my little brother told his teacher about my mom hitting us and cps got involved but nothing came of it because my parents coached us on what to say and because my dad had a great and upstanding career in the military it went nowhere i vividly remember my mother dragging my little brother to the tub and holding his head under the water my psych eventually reframed that as attempted murder and my mind was blown anyway there are so many other stories about how she would hit us degrade us and isolated us from all the family we had in mexico and i always believed it was my fault she even slapped me in the face when i was m pregnant with my son because i wouldnt turn the heat up and she was cold funny enough my water broke after an argument with her that day ive been in therapy since and its made such a difference she was so kind and understanding and helped me process so much first none of this was my fault while it seems so easy and obvious thats something i have to tell myself everyday second my father is no white knight whenever my mom would start hitting me id run behind him for protection but he wouldnt do anything hed just sit there and keep reading the newspaper he only cared about our grades accolades and what sports we were doing three my mom has bpd this was probably the biggest nugget because her behavior was a text book example the whole i love you i hate you youre not going anywhere anyway fast forward to now contact with them is very limited and the only reason my mom reached out this year is because she needed help with her homeworkand by that she wanted me to do it well i set my foot down two weeks ago and i told my dad that if she needed this much help she needed a tutor or switch majors he said alright and i have not heard from them since im sorry if its all over the place ive just never written all of this out and it opens up a lot of wounds i have wonderful children and a loving husband and i literally wouldnt even dream of treating my kids the way my mother did to me they are loved nurtured safe and secure
my dad was incredibly abusive to me ant my mom he wasnt always that way he used to be kind and i used to be excited to see him home from work when i was a kid that kind man died when i was or when he turned into an alcoholic and opiate addict or rather got back into his old habits from before i was even born he became verbally and physically abusive he was even abusive to me after a drunk driver nearly killed me saying it was my fault and i never should have been out that late he stole my hydrocodone while i was bedbound and was in extreme pain from a displaced sternum and multiple other injuries that was when i decided that i hated him after i recovered and got a good paying job a small inheritance from my grandfather i moved out shortly thereafter he received a pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis and began to decline and he became more reserved and subdued especially after the double lung transplant years later he died of a stroke or heart attack from a blood clot he never apologized he never attempted to reconcile even though i branched out to him this was recent and i felt like i havent been mourning his loss because i already did so long ago however ive been having dreams its how i remember him looking from before he was sick and before he began to abuse substances ill feel the excitement that my dads home and well eat zebra cakes play cards or chess together and go fishing in the morning or build a computer together i actually smiled and sat by him i woke up crying i hate that he died the man he became and we were never able to reconcile i miss the man he was before substance abuse
ok so i f was adopted with my twin brother when we were little like months into a super religious household with a older sister the encouraged sibling rivalry was also insane growing up my parents literally pitted up against each other and shit got pissed whenever we switched on each other but got suspicious and accusative whenever we didnt then years later comes my little sis i think she was like some sort of miracle baby or sum cuz of how much they my parents baby her shes got one of the worst cases of spoiled sibling baby of the family entitlement shit uve ever seen my parents never treated me and my brother the same little sis constantly got shit that me and my brother didnt she got all the awesome birthdays and gifts while my brother and i got cast offs literally my what was favorite gift for christmas of a mp player turned out to be a promo addition of one of my sisters gifts it really broke me finding that out but i always found shit out the minute i shut up i became invisible so i used to my advantage cuz around there u talked to much u pissed dad off and got hit it got better throughout the years after my older sis reported him to cps but i was too young and afraid of my father to speak out against him maybe if i had we would have been able to escape that house all of us but none of us said she so she was written off as a troublemaker and nothing happened my dad always had the saying that it was good that we were scared of him maybe that way we wouldnt disobey him as i got older i started to realize that shit wasnt normal there but every time i tried to get cps involved nobody said anything against him so i was was written off as an attention seeking troublemaker so instead i gave up and just ranted to my friends instead in order to protect my siblings i would act out to keep dads attention on me so he would hit me the most i just recently moved out now im living with my bf and my dad is shunning me until i stop living in sin coming up is the end of the school year in which one of my favorite cousins always throws a party im worried they might misconstruct everything and make me out to be the bad guy so do i let them all know before they have the chance ps this is just the parental abuse not to mention the torture my little sister put me through that my parents didnt give a fuck about or my brother literally trying to kill me multiple time and then telling people i tried to kill him
i got out of my adoptive parents grasp after they tried to get me to break up with my fiance at saying i needed to focus on family and my responsibilities i wasnt allowed to drive date or even have friends loving with them it got physical and i got a domestic violence protection order against her i got out and that was in november i am now living with my fianc i have a car our own apartment even my dream dog a corgi he works while i stay home and he provides everything i couldnt have had these experiences staying with that family as i was paying her in rent while also spending every month on her animals as well as using credit cards on her animals and i had to pay on them too im so glad i got out if anyone has any similar situations let me know
my mother beat me in the shower a few times growing up once or twice out of no where sometimes with a broom stick once with the shower head it wasnt an everyday day things and tbh i thought all kids were getting whooped just like me and that i was depressed because somthing was wrong with me did anybody else ever deal with things like that growing up
ive moved before but both times it was a pyrrhic victory at best because i had to end up moving back and i ended up being miserable with my new living situation this time i have to keep paying her back for the car on top of paying for rent at my new place and whatever other essentials hopefully i can land a job thatll pay me well enough to balance everything out but im still not used to this notion of freedom ive caught myself wanting to feel loved truly loved by her which i thought id long ago given up on
i dont exactly know how to do this but i definitely dont want to talk to my family as if they act like their mine im a young adult in a indian household so if you get the gist they are strict and religious im the older f and i realize or more or less came to terms with the fact my family hates me and does not prioritize me at all let alone love me any sort of problem i have with them resulting my life with boyfriends wanting to be my own person could never happened i today started talking about an issue with my parents about how i need a new laptop where it just does not fiction and i called it cheap and old and i tried everything in my power to make this shitty hp laptop last name it i tried it my mom spirals to say you dont have a job if you saved your money you could have gotten one then my dad chimes in to say how stupid and every name of the book i can think of for the lack of intel ago ve i have but lastly my younger sister in uni shits on me too because the conversation somehow involved her when she did not need to put in her two cents and it got all the way to the point where every end conversation is why dont i ever buy my self all the important stuff and why am i not prepared to buy my own necessities i thought it be fine to ask my parents for a laptop since they got my sister one bit too long ago not ti mention a lily lemon bag and they shit on me for not paying my own bus fares or for my computer because im an adult who should have money which i get but i got let go from my job because they still blame me otherwise all the way too saying how the rent money she charges me was to help me and my spending habits and not to help them even though that what they told me at the beginning this over all ended to my mom having an ego trip saying that there are more people that pay more and go to school and i have a month too move out and i have a month too get a job or move out i know this sorry doesnt make sense and im sounding all over the place but i worked country sleepless nights this weeks to prioritize my school so i could pass my first semester they always said if i have issues to come to them for help but all i got was shit on and theres even worse causes with my parents and my space or me dealing with boys and all i can do right now is not help but cry and wish to have a fiend that understands me or like advice but i think the number one thing i was is for a family that cares about me and or loves me enough not to insult me and which me luck for school or to value how my day is and not give me shitty a five to tell me how stupid i am maybe ill find love somewhere one day but m it with my family or with a partner man i want a hug rn anyway to anyone that gone this far to read this thanks for hearing me out i hope yall have a nice day
tw mentions of suicide and threats im usually left alone while my mom goes to school but im always too depressed to get out of bed everytime i hear the door open when she gets home i get hit with dread because i know she is going to immediately start to complain about how the place is a mess and if i defend myself i am always bombarded with insults and if we get into a argument she threatens to leave me harm me or tells me to get out of her house im she knows i am severely depressed and while writing this she has told me that she hates me and that she wished i succeeded in my suicide attempt back in and everytime i call her out she denies it and tells me that i do that to her and how i make her life miserable she has told me multiple times to go to hell and has straight up told me to kms the house is extremely nasty and borderline infested with roaches and she blames it all on me i dont want to call her abusive but at this point i dont think i can think her actions are just stress related anymore im unsure if my post will be taken down though i didnt see anything in the rules about it but i just want an answer i feel like im being gaslighted
hii i was told to post here thanks for noticing my thread im sorry if this is a wrong place to post this w tw child abuse fraud self harm sexual harassment i grew up in malaysia and attended college there before they made me drop out and migrated me to indonesia their home country i am working an online parttime job as a teacher to save up my parents and extended family has always been controlling about small and big things from the colour of clothes i wear daily theyre not skimpy at all to trying to put a wedge between my friends my exes and my current so even my boss for insisting that he wires my salary to me when they knew they couldnt coax the boss they wrote a letter impersonating me and forged my signature they cut me off of people they cant control basically i believe they care about me and want to stop me from dangerous people and yet they blamed me when a guy they were shipping me with and another teacher tried to sexually harass me and told me i was lucky that some people relatives whatsoever like to fondle with my thighs and my ass they constantly blame the people in my life for ruining our family relationship and label my friends and so as manipulative it was hard to see as the abuse was mostly emotional there were instances of physical violence too grabbing my wrist and spraining it and bruising my thigh i dont know if it was intentional nevertheless i was going down the deep end self harming daily sometimes several times a day and close to deleting myself from life im turning this november and ive been planning to move out since the first year of highschool and ive worked a stable online teaching parttime job i have recently created my own bank account and have a decent amount of money saved it isnt as much as i initially expected because my parents confiscated my yearworth of salary another finance worry aside from college i researched but i have no idea how insurance and taxes work i am uneasy because they are forcing me to resign once i start college in indonesia in september my boss was understanding and we previously discussed about having me on leave until i can stably move out and continue my job im still worried that things will go wrong and i end up moving out with nowhere to go i looked up housings and asked a friends mom whose job is a housing agent and found out i need my identification card to rent a house room however i cant physically survey them yet since they have me locked in the house only going out for church with their tight supervision im still thinking if i need to relocate to a different city in case my family ends up finding me the thought of what theyll do terrifies me it will be in the first semester of college when i move out hence theres a chance ill be in the dorms during the weekdays i just gotta have my identifications with me either by sneaking it out when i visit home for birthday or with a civil standby currently i have my identification card with me my birth certificate high schools graduate certification and passports are withheld but i know the location provided they dont move it i found out from my indonesian friend that i can phone the cops to come as a civil standby in case any violence happens and i always loved my family and thus ive tried reasoning a lot with myself asking if im just being a bad daughter that maybe if i studied more and get that a and not just an a or b or if i am a bit more perfect like they asked of me theyd love me as i am i guess my parents thought they were right as they mentioned they were raised that way too i hate to admit it but i feel guilty moving out since my parents and extended family are now unemployed of course there were happy glimpse but lots of things they did and are doing doesnt sit right and i feel like im about to lose it everyday many told me to get out and not look back and i came to terms that its for the best its still one scary thing to think about though thus if i may im asking advice about successfully moving out in indonesia opinions from any countries are appreciated too what are the things that could go wrong and i should watch out for any other thoughts your story that you wanna share if youre still here thank you for staying and reading my lengthy blog and may heavens bless you with a cute kitten puppy any animal you like take care w
so my previously abusive family are now helping me our with my daughter months because im doing it solo right now i moved back in with my dad about a year ago a couple months after i found out i was pregnant lately there has been some discussion about my independency which i find odd because i left home in and barely came back until last year because of the toxicity it wasnt until i literally ran out of the house with my belongings that the family decided to take what i have to say seriously i was usually the scapegoat anyways i find it hilarious when my dad or sister or anyone else tries to insinuate i dont know how to be independent aka never asking for help and choosing to struggle when there are better options which is such a heavy heavy poverty and lack mindset imo call it entitlement but i think they should think to themselves how shitty they were to me growing up and be thankful i have chose to let the pain go and not seek revenge or pettiness anyways i am grateful for them slowly changing their ways im using the abuse i faced as a catalyst for a better life for me and my lo
up until a few weeks ago i thought my only real parental problems were with my biological father who was physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my brother until he cut me off on my th birthday for being gay now here i am eight years after losing one shitty parent having to make the choice to cut off the other my moms an alcoholic she started drinking heavily when i was in middle school she went to rehab and she really seemed like she got better she relapsed for the first time when i was just starting high school she relapsed for the second time when i was about to graduate high school she relapsed for the third time three weeks ago shockingly the alcoholism is far from the main reason i have for cutting her off but its what made me realize a pattern of behavior for her my mom is a very selfish narcissistic woman i love her i do but everything my whole life has always been about her or about my brother her favorite child i have no ill will towards my brother hes one of my best friends he had a lot of open struggles with mental illness growing up and all of my moms however performative support was focused on the child who needed it ive always been the easy kid the quiet one the responsible well adjusted mature one i learned from a really young age that trying to talk about my struggles wouldnt do anything anyways it would always turn into my mom crying about being a horrible mother and a failure of a parent because how could she have two depressed children she called me the other week at pm on a work day i work evenings so i was only about two hours into my shift she decided that was the perfect time to drop the bomb that she relapsed the whole phonecall was full of her saying i wanted i needed i felt not caring that i was at work not caring at all how this would make me feel to hear knowing that id have to go back to work and pretend everything is fine for six more hours it made me realize she never really cared at all as long as it was what she wanted what she needed how it made me feel never mattered i havent spoken to her since that phone call now im sitting here at what is currently am on a work night sick to my stomach from crying all day thinking how much easier it all wouldve been for everyone if i wasnt born at all never seemed to make much of a difference to my parents at least ive got my aunt and my stepdad sorry for the novel feeling a lot of things right now

them not trying at all to get a hold of you or doing everything in their power to try to communicate with you
a rather random question i guess but i find it interesting has the abuse you experience affected at all what media you consume like what kind of music what kind of movies what kind of video games etc for me i think it has very much predisposed me to enjoying heavy moody and emotional music like breaking benjamin evanescence and linkin park and for like tvseries video games again i think it has predisposed me to heavily emotional darker etc stuff like two of my favourite video games are halo ce and bioshock infinite that first one may seem a little bit odd to people who dont know much about halo because its a shooter not exactly a super emotional personal story but the thing about it is that halo really deals with being isolated on this mysterious ring in a completely unwinnable and hopeless fight and fighting on anyway in the face of hopelessness and isolation and i think that really resonates with me and then bioshock infinite without talking about spoilers id say it has one of the most emotional and one of the darkest relationship between two main characters out there so yeah i think the abuse tends to have made my taste in media very emotional very dramatic very dark and very much aimed at stuff like isolation connection hope and hopelessness etc
do i need to forgive my mom if she is verbally physically abusive towards my dad i guess blood is thicker than water so i want to forgive go back to having a relationship with her i also keep thinking i am not a perfect human ive my share of hurting others so why not forgive another human i also cant help but keep going back to the question how id have reacted if the genders were reversed in the abuse im at my mid point in life years its emotionally draining tbh
aitah ok so my husband knows this person we will call her karen well karen was in a relationship with the father of her two children for yrs about months ago she left him over him abusing their son whom is i told her id help her however we could but that im on ssi and financially im not able to do alot well move along to the st of april she knows i have trouble saying no to people due to childhood trauma and past dv issues with exes reason i wanted to help her in the first place well this girl orders at one fast food place and at another on my card and grabs my card and hands it to the person in the window before i can speak she then proceeded to put in her gas tank and spent money in the gas station on whatever too knowing i have fears of getting hurt for saying no well i decided to try standing up for myself for once and she goes crazy on me and even has the nerve to say shes not paying me back and if i tell anyone they wont believe me she called me out of my name heres the kicker that really hurt and sent a photo of her with the man that has abused her son for years i am worried about the kids at this point and dont think theyre safe was i wrong to call cps and notify them there was recently a protective order against the father the son testified in court about the abuse and now karen is allowing father around them im honestly concerned because the man is violent and destroyed the last home they were in like destroyed it and she still let him back around the kids she said if i reported it that she would press charges on me she also said that if i said anything about the situation no one would believe me because im the r word im autistic and fully disabled
this is a long shot but looking for someone who maybe has had a similar experience and can help about a year ago my dad was diagnosed with cancer he is very active and the energy draining medication he was on and the impact it had on his ability to be active took a big hit to his mental health my dad has always had issues with mental health anger management narcissism depression but he was a fairly wellliked functional member of society flash forward to one year later hes been in prison twice now for stalking my mother she left him after months of giving up everything to try and help his mental health and sacrificing hers in the process including when he pushed her down the stairs and threatened to hit her with a baseball bat hes destroyed our family home broken all the windows destroyed all the photo albums hes lost all his friends and family the last time i talked to him was three months ago after he called me on repeat for three hours straight resulting in me having missed calls from him can someone please tell me what could have caused this and if there is anything we can do ive lost all hope my dad will ever get better and i assume he will be homeless soon thanks
so i live in an abusive household nothing has ever been fixed when i tried getting help the cps case worker said they understood because im special needs and im lying but it has been an issue with my older sister too but my older sister isnt special needs and nobody will believe me because i lie sometimes but not about my home situation my mom threatens me all the time the cops have been called multiple times and everyone i went to church with doesnt like her and knows shes abusive but she wanted to choke me because i laughed when she was yelling at me and i know she has enough power to end my life shes mean and abusive and she always calls me worthless and so on
for context i f live with my mom and my stepdad ive always had a goodish relationship with both of them but im finding a pattern of my mother going into what i call episodes where she doesnt consult anyone and buyssells something that effects all of us this pattern has been with compulsively buying a dog we have three now i love all of them but goes out of town a lot so i have to take care of them one day i came home from school and saw my car had been sold by her and she said that i can just use hers which i do and now its buying a new home we moved during covid so i changed what college i was going to there has been many other things but now were moving again apparently and i am in my final year of college i am a education student so where i was placed for my student teaching will now have to be changed and i will need to find a new job when the one i have right now is perfect for me and my career is this abuse am i overreacting for being upset with her i tell myself i should be grateful that i am able to live with my parents rent free while i focus on school but this is causing an extra stressor because now im looking to move out but with student teaching that will be my full time job unpaid appreciate youre teachers so i dont know how i will be able to afford to live on my own
my dad keeps touching me without me wanting him to not anywhere inappropriate but i cant do it anymore ive tried to tell him and he just says that he has to because hes my dad hes also been trying to push me into a religion again and he gets mad at me when i dont want to talk about it when i breakdown from sensory stuff or angsity i get my electronics taken away
my father and mother found me texting people in a phase i wasnt supposed to i had been through abuse a few days ago due to my parents finding out abt my relationship and my friends wanted to check upon me hence i was replying to texts my father says you can kiss your boyfriend comfortably but when i open the door on you changing clothes by accident you start crying and call me a bad guy i really dont know how i should perceive my dad after this arent the both a completely different dynamics what the hell
ill try to keep this short got out the psych ward for suicidiality a few days ago this was the rd time im ftm bisexual slovenia europe my parents never really hit me they only threatened but recently mom has started pushinggrabbing me and pulling me by my hair while we argue along with yelling as per usual and today my dad threatened to hitslap me if i say stupid stuff to doctorstherapistsocial workersin school i have a safety plain in case it gets physical and we have a meeting scheduled with the local social services about some housing thing the doctors at the ward recommend also i posted in helicopter parents i think yesterday they put some spying app on my phone when i was at the psych ward a few days ago
i moved across the country from my parents my roommate are great im doing okay with school and work ive been here for a few months and have a nice routine but i still cant get my head around that this is my new normal i still think im gonna have to go back or that ill wake up and everything was a dream or my roommates will kick me out even though i know that isnt going to happen but i cant stop planning an escape but ive already escaped when does this end
my throat hurts from yelling im tired and i want to sleep but every time i sleep i wake up to screams i used to cry when this happened but now im emotionless i guess im used to it
exactly as the title says im using an anonymous account because i am too ashamed im living with my parents and they especially my mother believe im not able to fend for myself and be a top student like many of mine or my familys acquaintances she is forcing my study schedule she is forcing me to study for the exams i havent passed from last year even though i have to study for the upcoming finals as well she always comes into my room under different pretexts when i ask her why she says its her right my dad agrees with her at times a few days ago she also checked out my whatsapp messages when i showed her some proof for enlisting in some workshop event organized by my college my phone is secured fingerprint and all that yet she broke my privacy at first opportunity she even had the audacity to tell me that my phone shouldnt be secured and my dad agreed with her she saw that i was contacted by a scammer to which i havent replied but she started getting insane anyways she has also forced me to install a family locator app life to be exact when i was in senior year of hs because she thought i wasnt going to take my graduation exam but she also uses the excuse that she could see me when i am in trouble and her colleagues are using it for their children one of them saved her daughter from being rped she compares herself to her boisterous colleagues almost every day and she wishes she could praise me as much as they do with their teenage or collegeaged offsprings and that includes former classmates of mine from hs or middle school presentday colleagues from uni and even my cousins it doesnt help that when i went yesterday for a lab i did the most idiotic things that only a person in need of psychiatric help would do they both think im mentally ill and bringing them shame due to my failures they also think im a burden they generally treat me worse than a kid including the time when i was an actual kid they havent beaten me at all or very rarely when i was that age especially with the belt but she started doing it a few months ago and now i have trauma and flashing images whenever i see a belt the first thought would be why am i not leaving from their house well in order for me to be accepted into a dorm id have to live in an area that is not under the immediate conscription of my city which is impossible since im living in the city itself and i cant get a job because of my college schedule so no rent for me either i wanted to leave to another cityanother country when i graduated from hs but didnt have the money and the grades its still a frustration to this day i wanted to leave for other reasons as well besides my family
how has your parents abuse affected your academic performance i remember when i was and my parents split they were screaming and offending each other the entire day my father was keeping us awake for an entire week police came several times he said he was gonna kill himself he was screaming all night and terrorizing us until the police was called at the end after he started threatening to murder my mom in the middle of the night he moved to another country afterwards i had to miss an entire school week because i was too exhausted and scared to sleep during all of this when i got back to school i got screamed at by my teacher who accused me to skip school and being irresponsible and childish my mother and her entire family told me to not say anything related to their divorce at school so i kept my mouth shut years have passed since then and i am attending a new school now since last year but more recently i cant focus at all i have constant brain fog each time i hear the voice of my abusive and neglectful mother it kills every thought that was forming in my head hearing her is always bad news the only reasons she talks to me are to either complain or scream and guilt trip me over everything sometimes she starts fights out of nowhere and starts screaming at me i usually just break down and try not to cry because i cant handle people screaming it takes so much time and effort that i cant even manage to properly do my homework sometimes also i just recently came the realisation that i have several traumas which for some reason are coming to the surface right now and are impacting me pretty badly most of them are because of my great upbringing seriously my mom brags about her parenting skills and even goes into detail to explain why they are superior i cant even manage to get therapy i am still having a rough time i feel completely empty even though i am trying to distract myself from my inner state recently i got back my math exam and i was devastated i used to be an a student up until months ago and now i am afraid if i am gonna get a failing grade my teacher showed dissapointment he told me that i could do better and that it is a pity teachers opinions matter a lot to me so it hit me like a rock i am actually still debating with myself if i should at least tell him that i am having problems outside of school which impacted my performance recently while also offering him to do some extra work
my dad wants me to be a very good football player i love football but im slowly losing love for the sport because all my dad does is lecture me about how i want to chill on weekends i am a middle schooler i just want to have fun i just want to hangout with my friends my mom is not any better because she signed me up for a football camp three states away i am writing this while getting a lecture from my dad please i dont know what to do
long story short my parents tried to claim that the abuse sa physical emotional was a result of our norwegian culture they go on to say they provided for us giving us everything we actually needed just as god has when they were initially confronted they adamantly denied any of the abuse whatsoever fell back on religion telling us that were horrible christians and going straight to hell if we dont forgive and repent theyve since admitted to lesser instances of the actual abuse that took place yet they still think that they are somehow next to god and use religion to manipulate their adult children religion is solely a tool for them to justify their abuse and is the reason i cant step foot in a church today
hi guys i just the time when me my brother and mom were walking home from school and my mom told my brother to pick up a stick from the floor then made me strip naked and beat me with it until i had lashes in my skin and couldnt walk properly for about a week when i was just came in my mind and ive been uncontrollably crying ever since lol im now i dunno why i just thought of that thr brain is so mysterious lol
over time ive realized theres a deep hollowness inside of me a darkness that swallows everything up a hurt that never truly goes away it can only be treated and thats only when i find someone im in romantic love with who seems to love me back i cant be sure where this hollowness comes from but i suspect its due to my parents emotional abuse to be clear the abuse i experienced is actually pretty tame compared to a lot of other people here have experienced i think i still sometimes question myself on whether i should call it abuse at all but based on the articles ive read about the topic it seems that it probably was anyway i guess im asking about how many of you feel the same way where theres like an underlying pain or hollowness that you cant ever quite get rid of you can only find ways to temporarily soothe it
im so scared and excited to do it ill finally be free
i seriously cant take it anymore im stuck in the house because im not allowed to go outside without one of them being present this means i have no way of getting a job im online schooled i have no form of id no access to my birth certificate or ssn and no bank account i struggle with a lot of things because i was never properly taught them and neglectedstunted in that way i remember how my mom would take me to the doctor and stay in the room with me up until i was because i told her i didnt want her to and before her reason was because she legally had to go back with me which isnt true shed always speak for me i was never able to get a word out never able to speak to the doctor alone about my health concerns i just feel like if i stay in this house im gonna die i keep thinking about it i feel like a waste of space i know people will miss me but i cant go on like this

i have posted before about my dad being a narc and had loads of other mental health we dont have a good relationship and i actually do hate him anyway im living at home with my father he had a very weird view that i should be grateful for him and he can treat me anyway he pleases because hes my dad and hes the authority figure he has absolutely no respect for me but demands i treat him with the upmost respect due to my personality i dont take his shit i challenge him back i wont let him speak to me like shit and when i set a boundary its over my dead body will he break it although he trys to break them every single day my dad currently doesnt work hes on benefits due to his mental health and it meant i became a young career has the years have went on ive released the whole young career wasnt in fact what i was my dad just gave me parent responsibility and stresses from about the age of that includes cleaning he is a messy person so i have to clean up after him cooking my meals and his financial burdens his mental health dumps etc i recently mentioned how it would be nice to get a new cooker and fridge freezer i never said i was going to just mentioned that it would be nice he took it upon himself to go buy a new fridge freezer never told me he was doing it or how much the fridge freezer he bought was k and is claiming i owe of it so half basically putting me into debt without my knowledge or agreement i absolutely refuse to give him the money it has caused crazy amounts of arguments and i tell him im on a budget and i cant afford to lose he then goes on to tell me i can pay it back a month is he joking when i refused this as well he then started saying the only reason you arent willing to pay for half is because im up to my eyes in debt which is not true at all he said that because i use the fridge freezer then i have added to the deterioration of it and thats why i need to pay half please bare in mind the fridge freezer wasnt even broke and didnt need replacing i moved in with my dad when i was years old thats how long we have had it i was a child i feel like when its a parents house its on them to pay for the up keep of their own house and that includes appliances i plan on moving out this year so im paying for a fridge freezer that he will then keep for the next years it doesnt make sense he believes this should be the case if anything needs to be replaced in the house carpets cookers washing machines etc i did mention he was on benefits but i can assure you hes got no shortage of money when it comes to buying things for himself or his hobbies im happy to accept if my thinking is wrong and he is in the right but it just doesnt sit well with me
hello years ago my family and i moved into a duplex the neighboring family consist of a couple and their kids the parents are probably like but they could fool me they look like theyve been on drugs for decades ive had my experience with druggies and some of the interactions ive had with them made it very clear to me theyre on something their oldest son is ill call him aaron second oldest seems middle school age ill call her sarah then theres two little ones young elementary age for sure due to the fact that our houses are basically glued together i can overhear a ton of fighting going on in there usually with aaron and the parents or aaron and sarah some of the stuff ive overheard is really brutal there will be times where i dont hearsee the parents for days their car is usually gone during these times which leads me to believe they are just abandoning their kids and leaving aaron to take care of them he goes to work during the day so whos taking care of them then the middle schooler no one theres been a couple times ive tried to go over there to check it out when i think the two little kids are alone just to make sure theyre okay and see whats happening they never answer the door which i understand ive taught my kids to not answer for anyone as well but i just really want to find out whats going on and honestly im curious to see the state of that house on the inside nosiness aside ive talked to aaron a handful of times he looks fully worn out constant fighting is exhausting enough but then being abandoned to take care of your siblings who knows if the parents even take care of the children when they are around ive told my kids to steer clear of them i do not want my children ever interacting with their parents my heart aches for those kids aaron shouldnt have to be a father to them they should be in a stable loving home the obvious answer is to call cps but i know this can also open up a whole new can of awful things for the kids being separated worse homes my thought was that this would be taking aaron out of his fiona gallagher nightmare but my wife thinks there might be a reason why he hasnt called cps on his own yet she has a point i need input about this
help please im years old and im experiencing abuse from my parents about half an hour ago i experienced a very scary situation with my dad my parents and i are usually very close but whenever they had mad it gets really bad me and my father were watching a movie like normal and then he spiraled i started talking to him but he didnt like the way my voice sounded sometimes it gets high pitched due to puberty voice crack etc so he started drilling his finger into one of the sides of my skull i told him to stop but he wouldnt until i hit him in the stomach he then started aggressively grabbing and gripping my body specifically my arms and chest i still have red marks and bruises from how hard he was doing it when i managed to pull myself away i told him that what he did was child abuse and that it was an offense he then proceeded to say these exact words to me if you ever call the cops the day you call the cops on me theyll find nothing but a corpse by this point i was really scared this wasnt the dad that i knew he would never have said anything like this i tried to confront him to repeat that while holding my phone out trying to record it he obviously didnt repeat it into the recording but instead said that i was the one who said that phrase i then put it down and told him that if he knew what he just did and what he said i told him that people have ruined their whole lives saying that have gone to prison and everything he then got mad and grabbed me again aggressive this time pulling out his phone and typing into the dial of his phone he held it out in front of me while grabbing and hitting me and told me to call the cops if i wanted he was yelling at me to call them i yelled stop and what was he was doing i asked him to realize what he was doing he then put his phone down and started punching pulling grabbing gripping and kicking me all simultaneously while yelling at me i dont remember much of what he was saying i was in shock im sure he was just repeating the same thing over and over about calling the cops and about making me ruin his life i also remember him yelling to call my mom theyre divorced to pick me up to take me to her house but shes working so that didnt work out i told him that i never stopped the recording on my phone and that it caught all of that which was a bluff he finally stopped he then started searching for my phone probably to destroy it i had hid it under the sheets so despite all that he looked he couldnt find it i told him to just leave the room and he finally did after that i was really scared and tried texting my mom i told her everything that happened and she blamed it on me she said it was my fault and that i provoked him that its because of my behavior she said its because i always cause problems despite being divorced they both still talk and she always supports him when we get into a fight because she wants to stay on his side to collect benefits were going on a vacation soon and hes paying for all her expenses on the trip i then told her that he needs to talk to him and get it together how could you think that after what he said and what he did that hes the one whos the victim she then told me that if i ever were to tell anyone or report it to anybody that he would kill himself and that there id be left with nothing she said that the officers would take me to a childrens home and live a horrible life she continued on with this a little more saying that im the reason this happens that its my behavior that im the root of all problems and that id be the reason they kill themselves an extra detail i want to put in i live with my dad and my grandma but i didnt think to go to my grandma about this she was in the other room when this happened because i knew she would back him up even further whenever we get into fights she always supports my father despite whatever he does even when he does some truly messed up things when she comes to bring me dinner later she doesnt say anything she pretends nothing happened i believe this is because she knows that this time he did mess up that he was the one in the wrong im scared of what she might to support him though thinking about his death threat has made me thought that she would be capable of that as well as long as to support her son from anything ever happening to him another add on i sleep in the same room

we were bickering about something that occurred with my grandmothers phone and she began to raise her voice so i did the same in defense she then proceeded to tell me to stfu and yell at me again and ill kick you in the fing head then began to tell me how she would take me out to the backyard and beat me black and blue with a pipe if i didnt continue my school work i am homeschooling so that is near impossible and went on to tell me that any officer or cloister would take her side because violence is the only option and it works and then continued to tell me how she would kick and punch me in the head and beat me with the pipe and my grandmother who i live with would have no right to stop her or say anything because it would be hypocritical to stop her and not stop my uncle who used to lay his hands on his kids
its just really obvious she is jealous i guess that im younger than her and wants to make me jealous all the time showed excitement a year ago when i was potentially terminally ill a year before that i almost died and she convinced me not to go to the hospital which i did eventually and it ended up saving my life like she doesnt just hate me she wants me to die

when my mum and dad got divorced i went to live with my dad for years and then came to live with my mum and stepdad we would regularly get into fights but not physical until they started getting physical and then we did not fight for months so i thought it was all good until stepdad me and mum one time our dog almost died for going through the bin and they blamed me of course and about a month later or the day im writing this it happened again stepdad kept shouting at me that our dog almost died last time and i told him to shut the the fuck up and then he came at me and kicked methis time i had some sense in me and i fought back my mum didnt even stop us i have a bruise on my stomach and im currently in the bathroom and locked myself up in here cause i cant deal with these shitty people anymore my mum tried her best to be a good parent but shes not fit for it i wish i never existed im glad my dad is supporting me in australia through this
right now everything feels wrong and like it will never be right again my mom keep trying to make me open up to them when i tell them that im not comfortable with it and would rather just keep it to myself one time when we were at costco my mom asked me why i looked so sad and i halfheartedly told her i was just thinking about my friend who at the time had been ghosting me and was making me anxious but that it was nothing to worry about she proceeded to belittle and guilt trip me in the middle of the store in an effort to make me talk to her when i clearly stated to her multiple times that i didnt want to before giving up and making me feel bad by shooting me dirty looks and being very curt eventually i couldnt take the treatment anymore and finally told her about my friend ghosting me through tears before she brushed it off with hes probably just tired today give him some space i just nodded and said okay thinking that this was just a normal thing that parents said when their kid talked to them i later learned that it wasnt another time i was with another of my friends and my mom had called me i was laughing and having a good time and answered to her screaming at me over how i left our dog outside for hours nobody else was home and i was leaving to be picked up by my friend i apologized immediately and said that i had genuinely no idea how hed gotten out and didnt know he was outside in the first place as well as that id never leave my dog outside on purpose she called my reasoning bullshit and drove me to tears infront of my friend and her mom she does this a lot so i just wiped away my tears and told my friend that i was okay and that it was normal my friends mom said thats not normal parents dont scream at their child over the phone until they cry what is hurting me what isnt hurting me what the actual fuck is going on

my dad has done so many things in my life that are not considered normal for instance he cut off all my hair with a pair of kitchen scissors as i begged him not to i pleaded and pleaded but he cut it by force since then every tiny little thing i do that lands me in a bit of trouble he uses it against me and the instance in which he even cut off my hair to begin with all i did was tell my sisters tutor that im having trouble with biology and school is difficult he then proceeded to tell my father that im an unserious student that combined with petty complains of my unclean room and leaving dishes upstairs made him beat me up with a belt till i was bleeding and forcefully cut off my hair im a girl by the way so this was very demoralzing and i became slightly depressed and had zero self confidence my mum is barely any help whatsoever she sometimes switches up and joins his side by adding fuel to the fire and if not she leaves and goes upstairs with the rest of my siblings so they dont witness all of this i once went upstairs and pleaded and cried with her to make my dad stop and she looked at me with a pitiful look on her face and said theres nothing she can do theres many instances this has happened and i can broadly mention them once i put on press on nails and i was told they were too long they were not that long and i was told to remove them but then i forgot and the following evening he beat me up and almost cut my hair but luckly i hid the scissors prior this has been off and on and my dad is bipolar because later on he can start calling me his sweet girl and act all lovingly to me trust me this is not the start theres so much more i can say i cant go to a trusted adult because this is deemed as normal i also tried talking to a few teachers about it and theyve done nothing whatsoever im only please give me any advice
iam male and my sister is we live in pakistan ever since the farthest can recall my life i have always been subjected to a life of blatant favoritism neglect and abuse regarding favoritism my sister was always the epitome of success and perfection amongst my parents and relatives alike everything she did even if it was wrong was just passed off as a minor mistake by a princess she was an average grade student throughout her school life an a student in middle school and pretty average throughout highschool th to th and thth her results were always celebrated and she always recived tons of gifts whenever our distant relatives would come over or we would go to their houses she would always be greeted with such excitement and whatnot given gifts cash etc meanwhile i was told to shut up and sit in a corner rarely got minor gifts and some slim money her pocket money has been pkrmonth since she was which isnt alot in first world countries but very valuable here meanwhile i have only been getting pkr since years old she would always have her friends over and i would be told to go to the rooftop for the time being her friends was there i wasnt even allowed on the second floor of our house and the rooftop in the cracking heat of the sun has only tiny shed with tools bricks boxes and cobwebs and whatnot during special occassions and festivals like eid or birthdays mine would never even be celebrated i wouldnt even be wished most of the time while her celebration would be for days her birthday and the day before it with again gifts and cash and whatnot also i only got a mobile phone at after working in manual labour in construction for year for hours after school and saving up the money id get at the end of the day the only electronic my parents ever bought me was a cheap tiny iball tablet at years old which upon reciving they forcefully took it from me saying just let your sister play on it for some time which she broke after raging in a videogame i broke down crying that day and never forgot oh and she had an ipad at that time a genuine ipad pro and a good spec panasonic phone btw all paid for by my parents as a year old ofcourse i didnt want to do construction labour i wanted to play have friends and have fun like any other child my parents forced me into it saying youll have to make money one way or the other we already take care of your sister so youll burden us even more you are a boy so make it work this is just scratching the surface i might write more in the future there is so much more i want to write about their favoritisim but lets cover the other topics aswell regarding neglect most of the times when i would be sick with excruciating fever and other flus for days my father wouldnt even give me medicine saying suck it up walk it off already drink some water and whenever id try to sleep to alleviate the pain hed always wake me up and force me to walk its only after multiple days that hed finally call a local travelling doctor for a checkup he woould also try to cheap out on medicine like it was a game mind you the checkup and medicine together costed less than a dollar and he was still hesitant to pay for it one february when i was years old i woke up with extreme pain in my abdomen area it felt like constantly being stabbed and torched at the same time and it did not stop i woke up crying i did not know what it was i would always vomit anything i consumed any liquid food anything after days of excruciating non stop crying not being able to sleep and harming myself only did he take me to a hospital where upon checkup i was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis only then did i recieve treatment and finally healed for the love of god these are just instances there are way more like the times my parents would go on trips with my sister and leave me alone in the house often with no food at all regarding abuse oh boy where do i start this brought me so much trauma even writing about it will probably make me unable to sleep tonight firstly when i was my sister forcefully took my turn to play a retro game on my parents computer i could just watch her play so i did she sucked at the game and would punch the keyboard a few times id tell her to stop shed break it eventually she lashed out and broke the keyboard keys flew everywhere and it was completely cooked i rushed to my dad and told him what happened i told him what my sister did with as much fear and truth as an year old could emmit my father upon reaching there saw my sister get up from her chair casually just pick her phone up from the desk and say hes the one who did it and my father completely believed her like no suspicion at all you know what he did next took out a broomstick and started thrashing me mercilessly i jumped back and started crying asking him why is he doing this multiple times shes the one who broke it he slapped me across the whole face multiple times my mother didnt give a single fuck and was reading a book with headphones in he tied a rope to my a fucking year olds arm and took me outside he took me to the tree in the field next door and tied me up there while slapping me multiple times locals came and asked what he was doing he made multiple excuses and exaggerated things until someone he knew came and told him something regarding not to tie under this tree no one goes under this tree because of some paranormal bullshit so my father took my home and locked me in the storage room upstairs nd floor and smashed the broken keyboard on my head and locked me in for the rest of the day all i had was a pot of water and nothing else i was only unlocked after the sunset and given no food whatsoever all i could do was sob and cry sitting in the darkness while i tried to assemble the broken keys back onto the keyboard this is just one instance oh no there is so much more one day idk what age i dropped pkr way way way less than a single dollar and my punishment well kicked from home for the day not the first time at all then i was dragged back and tied up infront of my home and given water in a pot like a fucking animal idk what happened after that during the day but it was not fucking plesant oh just to showcase the irony my sister stole k pkr from my parents locker something percent her dads monthly income hes never been a dad to me and casually defended herself like nothing happened at all my parents believed her like she was god all eyes were on me and even though they had no evidence on me i was kicked out of the house after being beaten and went to live with my aunt for a few days during my third day at my aunts my sister stole another k pkr from my parents locker this time i wasnt there so how could it be me heres how i know it was my sisters doing after i returned home i suspected her to the core that night at she messeged me saying smoothie tonight my treat i was suspicious i asked her whats the catch why being nice to me she just told me to relax and shed bring it over to me after mins i was way too sus eventually after she brought it i dipped my pinky in it and tasted it it tasted bitter like something had been mixed in it i thought it might be berry stems she forgot to remove but i was sceptical she always kept barging into my room multiple times asking if i drank it i replied wait im busy ill put the glass outside when im done i was sure that she was trying to poison me but then i remembered about the money i immediately dumped the smoothie in a polythene bag and hid it behind my wardrobe and pretended to my sister that i drank it i knew she put her sleeping pills into it and i was right after hours am she slowly came into my room slowly turned on the lights poked my head a few times i pretended to be dead fucking asleep dead asleep but i wasnt due to the paranoia i didnt make a single move not a single word and saw from underneath my blanket her opening my parents locker it was in my room with a duplicate key and look for any money they might have left there still after minutes she couldnt find anything because they moved it all to the bank she just left next day i told my parents they questioned me doubted me etc etc but the pussies didnt dare confront my sister my sister was always spoiled and threw a tantrum on every minor in convience my parents always fed her delusions and was visibily scared by her well a week after that alot happened they discovered her being in severe debt and having written down the amount she stole in her diaries the people she gotta pay back what more she gotta steal etc etc my parents being the absolute pussies cuddled up to her ears old btw this happened in fucking like a fucking toddler and she said she didnt steal anything and it was her money and she took a loan etc etc for an ai course my parents believed her without a doubt paid off her debt and went back like nothing happened she conned them like her bitches she had no course she is a university dropout she doesnt study has books and never did they see that she doesnt fucking study the night after that they discovered she sent nudes to over guys and has been sending for the past years after lying to them she doesnt talk to any guys my aunt caught her when she was at her house they discovered that when she was in university all she did was skip classes go to bars drink behind their backs take addictive substances and sleep with multiple guys they discovered the pictures of her and her guy friends her in their car drinking smoking and pictures of her and a dudes in hotel rooms she had absolutely no shame and day after that my father just said lets forget anything even happened and just went back to normal without even confronting her shes still doing these things but they wont listen to me i have lost all hopes in them and want to cut them off asap of the things are unmentioned academic unfairness privacy breach etc etc if you read this far thank you and i appreciate you
they are literally crazy if anything happen of we do something wrong the first punishment that comes to their minds is that theirs no food for us i mean are they crazy what did you mean no food for us they always twist our words and actions its tiring and annoying and my mother if anything happens she always victimize herself she hits shout curse at us i am in this stress for yearssss and i am not doing well at school my grades are dropping my concentration is gone i am tired i just wanna sleep and never wake up again
so my mom is mostly like this because of her exboyfriend and her job position as a manager if i try to say im sick all she will do it hit me with a belt and scream until i wake up its so bad im numb to it i dont know where this came from but i cant do anything
my parents abuse me and my siblings every day we live in such stress and horrible home they are always shouting always screaming at us my mother is a narcissist and always victimize herself and my father only listens to her he never try to understand or listen to us he just shouts and scream at us i have seen my big sister getting hit ever since i remember my mom would grab her from her hair and slap her hit her in the stomach my parents always hit me too and my brother im the middle child and i have been hit so much and they always telling me stuff like youre a failure you will never get anything done in your life its awful and the problem that we get abused for stupid reasons like watching tv for too long for eating much its horrible and theres nothing i can do im and i have depression truma anger issues thinking of suicde im tired and i dont know what to do
why do people do this it baffles me it truly does i was victim of an abusive mother and i went no contact years ago and never speak her name i will never post about her on social media i have deleted all traces of her from my life however sil will tell anyone and everyone how bad her mother was to her as a child and was estranged from her most of her adult life but heres what i dont get she truly was an evil woman who beat her kids drank herself silly everyday had affairs and went on holiday and left them to fend for themselves mil died in the last years and all sil does now is post constantly about her mother and how shes missing her and painting this false image to the world that her mother was this person she wasnt she is always posting about the milestones her mum is missing her engagement her upcoming wedding and how things would be different if she was here im thinking that is a lie she didnt even bother to go to your graduation why would she care if u were getting married i am really baffled as to why people lie when someone dies like all the bad they did never happened and suddenly they are the best mother that ever existed yesterday she posted one of her usual posts with pics of her and her mum when she was a kid the usual garbage seeking attention and late last night i posted something on my instagram about my own healing journey and she replied so true for real etc but today she will prob post another attention seeking post for sympathy can someone explain why people do this this person ruined your childhood with abuse they left scars that no time heals they die and suddenly they are promoted to saint hood overnight and can do no wrong but when you talk to me u will tell me all the evil things she did but on facebook u tell a different story i cant bare this attention seeking
as the title says i believe i was told i am a burden to my family or family because i do not consider them to be family as per usual my narcissistic mother is acting like a child having meltdowns about minor issues nothing out of the usual but it is becoming unbearable its not uncommon for her to berate me or call me derogatory names such as dumbass idiot ungrateful selfish nasty pig lazy pathetic excuse of a human being and useless today was no different she was yapping on about how much of a useless human being i am etc until she snapped at me and told me nan and i could have had so much done with our lives if you werent always in the fucking way in other words i am a burden to them both i make their lives miserable and cause them nothing but trouble and yet i have no choice but to sit here and take it because no one can or will help
as the title suggests my mom did apologize for context she is a narcissistic selfcentered egomaniacal jerk who has way too much pride way above the legal limit and around years ago while i was doing high school i was struggling in math then again i had been failing math for a long time and her way of helping or helping me was physical abuse i would get so overwhelmed that i would just block every sense i just did not want to deal with it she decided to take a bunch of news papers and make it into a stick and repeatedly hit me with it for months things got to a point that i hated myself so much that i could not look at myself in the mirror because an additional gift i got with the physical abuse was a high level of emotional manipulation i have always been a slow learner and would get overwhelmed easily and the physical abuse just made it worse i eventually started pushing myself just so that i could avoid being hit or hurt by her even if i was heavily burnt out i did not care i wanted the pain to stop she was also emotionally volatile during that time due to family troubles especially with her parents my grandfather is also a narc and my grandmother is a gossip talker who will talk trash about everyone my mom got all these negative traits from them eventually the abuse stopped after my math final and i got for those wondering and my mom got the bragging rights telling about my hardwork and her excellent couching i dont know if this is a trend in india but i hope its not but every person is willing to go to great lengths to please and impress relatives who will not give a damn about them one example was when my aunt came over and my mom was going on and on about my choice to become a doctor while behind the scenes she was forcing me to do it she loves bragging and in the due process she is losing her children for people who do not care about her fast forward years i took business and i am doing really well since i have a great deal of interest in the topic and i was allowed to take this subject because i began to fail my science classes additional information my family owns a small business and we have a store which is a minute drive from here and my mom takes care of it full time additionally i with my sibs take tutoring as per her request and thankfully we take the profits as well since we take the classes one issue with my mom is she does not realize the work we do both science and business are not easy subjects so i take a lot of time with it and we are in open schooling so i have the ability to plan my day i start at am then stop at pm for lunch then i resume at pm and finish up at pm then i play video games so i spend a lot of time learning things up and it takes a lot of time especially in subjects like statistics she does not understand this and she makes spontaneous plans on the dot she is a light sleeper and an empty mind is the devils workshop and she makes an insane plan and announces it the very next day which gets into your nerves if we are going to the shop i need to replan the whole day since i heavily reliant on ai to form my subject material and i rely on it for questions to solve and i have to take subject books regular book my calculations notebook my laptop other electronics which is a tedious task when i ask her for minutes to plan she looses her cool and goes on and on once i had to stay up till am to solve a particular formula so i wanted to sleep in and she wakes me up at am and asks me to come with her to the store she did not even allow me to brush my teeth or even have some milk she would get so upset even if we agree to come but ask for some time to plan that she would leave on the spot and then blame us onto today so i wake up and do normal stuff i go through some of the topics i will be learning and plan a timetable and i go down for some milk and then she calls me to her room and apologizes and i quote do you remember the day i lost my cool while teaching you and hit you well i am sorry ok step in the right direction but small problem it was not one day it was months and it did not stop there she is very very emotionally abusive but hey at least she apologized and i gladly accepted but then she went on for minutes on how i would always struggle and how i hurt her by driving her insane that tipped me off the wrong way like if you are taking accountability you dont blame the other party you dont try to justify your wrong doing that made me instantly realize that despite everything she still holds onto that damn ego the abuse was years ago and this festered in her for whole years but to rub salt in the wound my sister later told me that she had to convince mom to apologize to me mom was reluctant to say sorry to me to make matters even worse mom went on for an additional minutes telling me about how i am not doing enough in studies she has no idea how much i do and suddenly she is now an expert so for minute i had hope but for the next minutes that hope along with any faith that i could possibly have relationship with her was just washed down the drain now she wants me to come to the store with her so she can couch me the subjects problem with this is that she has no commitment she will only help me for days at max then i am back to doing it on my own and she has a problem with everything i do she does not like my format of notes and she is a major control freak and if i go there and learn from her again chances are i am doomed i dont know how to deal with this my siblings are my literal pillars at this moment and honestly i depend on them way too much for matters like this anyways wish me luck i just wanted to vent this out in a safe space thank you
hi im a yearold woman ive taken a career break for mental health reasons and its been months since i moved home i moved here because my parents and i thought itd be the perfect scenario for me to recover from my mental ailments but surprise surprise it happened to be the worst decision i ever made in the whole span of months i broke down hurt myself and developed fresh new traumas because of my fathers temper it has been happening since i was a little kid with no understanding of wrongs and right and with time it has only worsened with only one good change he doesnt beat the shit out of me anymore with age and outside exposure i learned that whatever my father said and did to me all this time was horribly wrong but somehow i always managed to forgive him and keep a soft spot for him i always had a hope that if i tried to explain it to him calmly he might see his wrongdoing and he would change but who was i kidding he has become worse let alone changed even a bit today was the last straw of my scrapes of patience he lost it unreasonably as usual plus he hit my mother this time i wasnt quiet i yelled back calling out on his bullshit next he threatened to kill himself with a knife this wasnt new btw every time he felt that he had no more cards he threatened to die me my sister and my mother have spent our whole life not backtalking because this man had us shit scared of committing suicide anyway i digressed so today after his suicide drama my mom and sister jumped on him to stop him i was sitting and watching the show because i knew those were all empty threats to gain sympathy he got so damn furious seeing me unaffected and thats when i added more to my words but this time in a calm tone he couldnt take that too and finally shouted at the top of his voice telling me to shut the fuck up while still being physically aggressive towards my mom and sister i got up came to my room cried my eyes out and decided to leave for good all my life even after being right in the middle of the same abuse repeatedly i never thought of leaving but now im done i have no money and no job or job prospects my boyfriend is helping me with the money and my friend is gonna let me stay at her place for a while the plan is to get out of here find a job and never look back but who am i kidding when has life worked out as per the plan although this step looks like my only option to end this bullshit once and for all im still unsure i need some help and suggestions from you guys on whether i should go ahead with my plan or not are there any other options that i can explore
hi im and im moving out this autumn but my brother is and will be left behind obviously i cant take him with me right now so he will stay with our parents who are not that nice scream around a lot and mentally drain both of us i just feel so guilty for leaving but i really cant take it anymore i do want him to br okay and im scared that he will suffer more because theyll be angry that i moved out i just want my brother to be okay this is the first time since always that were on such good terms
some of the stories ive read here are dreadful and my heart goes out to you guys my story started when my parents decided to move to a foreign country when i was both my parents were narcissists and their relationship was already shacky even before then my mother suffers from untreated depression and outright had a temper tantrum on the week of our departure and my father likely suffered from cptsd from his screwedup childhood and was completely mechanic and unable to feel empathy my mother had an abusive father and my father was abandoned by his when he was so a lot of undealt trauma going on all around my father wasnt present from the time of our move and my mother worked at night so i started to take care of myself when i was and by the time my parents divorced i became the head of the house until my mother remarried my mother was deep in depression which i understand divorce was terrible for my as a child but it must be equally terrible for them i know they both dealt badly with it my father became an alcoholic and i was forced to spend every weekend with him removing any possibility for me to have a social life as a normal teenager my father died some time ago due to cancer without ever trying to fix our relationship so thats a done deal but my mothers relationship keeps getting difficult im neurodivergent adhd hsp and i suffer from cptsd ptsd and social anxiety and have suffered burnout among other health issues and lost everything my home job studies girlfriend all my possessions aside from a backpack with two changes of clothes and my old laptop i eventually moved out back to my home country as a defacto homeless person distance has been good for me but my mother keeps on not respecting my boundaries and i dont even think shes aware of her behaviour and shes hostile to any conversation regarding her doing anything wrong i sometimes dont feel like talking or answering the phone and if i did that back when i lived close to my mothers km if i did i would have my stepfather at my house within the hour disregarding any of my privacy or right to be left alone my health problems are not live threatening and i was never suicidal so there was no reason for such reaction i felt mad and felt bad for my poor stepfather who is a great bloke no i live km away she cant do that but will still become abusive by phone call and will go as far as calling the building concierge to check on me when i dont answer the phone mind you im yo and bloody well know how to live my life im not perfect far from it but this is ridiculous and aggravates me as well as doesnt help my mental state she will pick on everything and i know mothers pick on things your beard is too big or you should cut your hair but when most mothers say that they dont get mad when you carefully and diplomatically say something to the form of thanks but its my choice my mother has thrown temper tantrums when i refused to accept her decoration suggestions at my home and the sort and everything she throws this line i dont want to make you feel guilty but we have paid so much for you we deserve respect and as for respect she means i must be a yes man i was there for years while i lived under her roof and it was torture and for paying she means they helped me and im thankful when i had my burnout and lost my job but then she goes and exaggerates willingly or not and starts saying they paid for stuff they havent like my studies my previous car and the such im getting to the point where im just tired and want to be left alone im single and lonely yes i have a few friends and have accepted im likely to never become a father but seeing what my predecessors did thats probably not a bad thing i would have loved to have a family but i dont want to be another abusive prick of a father i come from a long line of those and maybe its good it ends with me i rather be lonely than be abused ive cut ties to my fathers family aside from my halfsister and im honestly thinking of cutting ties with my mother but im not sure she will let me or even if it is the right thing to do im just really really tired im sorry for dumping all this shit on you but i really needed to talk and well i dont have friends that im comfortable enough to bother them with this kind of thing
all throughout yesterday mom yelled at me and my brother in the car about our grades we were supposed to go somewhere but she was too mad to go to the place we were supposed to go so she drove for hours keep in mind were high schoolers close to graduating so we shouldve sorted this out by now grades have been a problem since elementary school so youd understand why she would yell for hours she wishes we never existed she says were just like our dad a liar lazy asshole etc she tells us if were so depressed leave the house she tells us well be whipped if we dont improve she keeps asking what am i supposed to be proud of we passed by a graveyard and she said you might as well be dead she threatens to drive the car off the edge she keeps telling us go find your dad she says everyone in the neighborhood thinks her scolding us is entertaining and the reason voices are heard outside is because theyre talking about us she says were making her look like the bitch she threatens to hit us in public she keeps reminding us of the day we reported her to cps and says shes not abusing us well shes right it sounds abusive but she spoils and doesnt neglect us there were points where i considered therapy because i actually want to be happy but my brother says that theyre gonna ask me whos causing my sadness and mom will face criminal charges no matter what anyone says or how mean she is she is not an abuser abusers only abuse for no reason abusers treat their child like nothing mom is abusing because of our bad habits mom feeds us and provides shelter she got straight as and is working as a nurse we shouldve put in the same work as her but no were the first in our family to fail were the embodiment of our awful city and her amazing city actually tries in school i keeo going ro credit recovery and it upsets her because school is about doing it right the first time failure is not okay we have to be perfect or else my grades are terrible every year so im factually stupid if anything im the abuser im the one who should be facing criminal charges for not getting good grades and overall doing my part one day i want to turn myself in to the police and directly ask them to arrest me doesnt matter if i broke a law or not i have to be arrested or ill become a worse person i wish i was as smart as you the person reading this i wish i was as responsible hardworking and kind as you i wish i was as perfect of a human being as you you arent a waste of human life i am you arent a failure i am whatever negative thought youre thinking about apply them to me instead of yourself im asking you to insult me instead of support me i am not a victim i am the abuser
my narcissistic mother makes me feel guilty about a fairly new connection a fairly new friend and the fact that i havent met up with her since february the first meeting was at the end of february after that i went silent for the entire month of march because this is a fairly new connection as i said before i met this peer at work and it clicked then we met once and then we didnt meet again for a month but i did want to meet up with her again in april i was just busy in march i still wanted to visit grandma and other family members and see their new cat and meet up with my sister a few times so i didnt think about it anymore and my mother makes me feel so guilty about this and pretends that its too late to build a friendship now and that ive already ruined everything i said i would send her a message next week but my mother calls me lazy and inflexible normally she makes me feel guilty about not visiting family members and grandma and now i do that and its still not good this is quite a new connectionfriendship and is it weird to want to take things slow mother now acts as if i have neglected a fullfledged friendship while she only sees friends once per an entire years or two years its not a fullfledged friendship yet
my longtime boyfriend and i ended up getting pregnant it wasnt planned and i know its not ideal but i have always wanted kids and i dont want to abort my baby im still living at home with nmom and step dad while my bf and i save up for a place of our own he has a full time job and is taking classes im in college on a full ride and i have talked to my school about how to continue to stay in school with a baby and they are willing to work with me the problems started when i told my mom i was pregnant before i was even through telling her she immediately said shed pay for an abortion i told her i didnt want that and she laughed in my face told me i had no idea what i was doing and that if i wanted this baby i had to move out immediately and shed take me off her insurance and cut me out of the money left by my late father that is supposed to be split between the two of us my step father tried to step in but she immediately shut him down she said later when i realized my huge mistake in having kids shed help me give my child up for adoption she went on about how she did everything herself and made it but its not possible for me because i am too stupid and youngmy was when she had me and she has no interest in being a grandmother at any point in her life and thats when she finally admitted she just doesnt like kids i was shocked but not surprised i knew she never liked me but i always assumed it was because of my dad or something about me my mom has always hated my boyfriend but idk i thought maybe once she heard i was having a baby things might change stupid i realize shes still pushing for me to have an abortion even after throwing me out and after i have repeatedly said i do not want one i finally blocked her im staying at my boyfriends place and were going to move in together its a small place but i think we can make it work my step dad is working to sneak my things over social security card birth certificate etc things mom refuses to let me get my bio dads parents are working to help me the best they can they raised me more than my mom did id stay with them for weeks while dad was overseas should i go no contact i know she has no interest in my baby and clearly doesnt care about me but at the same time shes my mom and idk how to move on from that how do i eventually explain to my kid why my mom isnt part of their life

my mom has abused me in the past ever since i was four i thought it was normal growing up untill a few months ago when she humiliated me infront of guests laughing while telling them about how she threw my tablet across the room breaking it as it hit the wall because i was that addicted what actually happened was my sister at the time made us some instant noodles my older brother and my sister wanted to watch frozen while i wanted to watch the kung fu panda me being outnumbered decided that i would watch the movie on my tablet and my siblings were happy with that so i went to my room and watched kung fu panda on my tablet fast forward minutes and my mom comes into my room screaming at me for being antisocial and took my tablet and smashed it against my back while yelling at me for how stupid i was then threw it against a wall and was leaving when my dadwho was sleeping in another room woke up and heard what happened he then asked what happened and why she did my dad obviously told her how wrong she was while she refused to accept fault he then comforted me as said he would fix my tablet as soon as he could and that he would be there for me something similar has happened every months where my mom would beat me up for being a kid but she would always do it after my dad had gone for work just looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation
i know my father is awful and im ok estranging from him but my mother who doesnt live with him im a bit confused about my mother is definitely abusive around years ago i told her i was suicidal and she was supportive of it and she showed it to me by buying a whiteboard putting it right in front of my bed and writing its okay to kill yourself i support you or like ill love you in heaven or earth etc etc years ago when i was in middle school she used to hit me which she denied multiple times in front of cps when i was before calling me crazy and saying she was taking me in to get tested for personality disorders i have a history with mental health issues but nothing further than depression ive always been quiet and isolating angry only with parents after being hit or touched she also accused me of emotionally abusing her when i was after i told her that calling me names all the time made me feel bad and was abusive then when she accused me of abusing her and me asking how she would respond well i dont know but im only mean to you because i feel like your being mean to me getting closer to but before my birthday she also used to tell me that she didnt care if i was murdered raped or kidnapped because i wasnt going to be her liability anymore multiple times but whenever anything bad happens with my father and since ive turned shes started to call me frequently and ask me if i need money or help or anything and has told me that no matter what i want her and her friend whos known me since i was a child are my support group whether i want them or not and that i always have to check in with them shes been helpful even when i dont need her or when something happens and am terrified to call my father but am required to call at least one of my parents due to the rules of the high school i attend i never do anything terrible the only time ive been required to contact a parent was recently when i missed my transportation back to campus and had to get back the next day and needed her to say she was okay with it shes been so nice lately but she was just screaming at me as i was crying in the floor about how mentally fed up i am just a year ago should i forgive and forget which ive done multiple times before or is she just different because she knows i plan on not talking to her basically am i justified in estranging edit she also used to make fun of my eating disorder laughing at me loudly in public spaces but recently shes always telling me about how i should take advantage of life and that she doesnt want me regretting anything and telling me that i should participate in fun activities like prom it just seems like she cares i feel like im holding her to things that are all a year old at this point
hi i just want to get opinions on what exactly me and my dad should do i dont wanna go on all day about my whole childhood till now with this woman but moral of it all shes mentally abusive and physically abusive she also has bpd and refuses to get help we have gotten the police involved so many times because of the way she is and nothing has came out of it what you need to know is i no longer live with my dad the only reason being is because even though he pays my rent and bills my mom kicked him out theyve been divorced for years now and every single day from then she has been constantly calling him he has her blocked and she still manages to yell at him through voice memo she called his new girlfriend a bitch so many times despite the fact that they have been divorced for seven years she has a job but told me not to tell him because she doesnt want to pay rent but instead buy her own things like clothes kitchen appliances and more she bought cameras to spy on my dads family because they live on the third floor she steals checks from him she keeps all the lights on so he has to pay more bills shes even trying to tell him if she sees my dad hanging out with her brothers he has a good relationship with her family she will tell everyone hes trying to rape and groom my year old cousin which is the most disgusting thing ever he has told my grandma about it and not my cousin though because we both know my cousin will literally try to fight my mom because sometimes she can be a little ghetto my mom knows this is not true and is only saying this because she wants him to lose everything i have been begging my dad to get her out of our apartment so he can move back in how exactly should we get her removed because hes trying to get in contact with the landlord and tell them about my mom and how he no longer will pay the rent and bills at my house unless they talk to my mom and see what she has to say forgot to mention we live in new york my dad already has to deal with my rent and his rent at his apartment in nj which then she will have no excuse because first of all her job is parttime and i dont think she needs enough money to pay rent and bills here so thats how were trying to get her out my thing about court is what exactly should we do what if the court doesnt listen to me because im still a minor im and unsure if they will hear me out will the court allow my dad to get his apartment back or is it only the landlords choice im also scared if she does get kicked out she will harass us so what orders should i specifically get against my mom since she has a whole abusive history with me do you think the court will believe my moms fake stories also another thing my dad has all the voice mails saved so i would like to know how it would help in courtand will they do something about the stolen money i need answers so if you had the time to read thank you so much and let me know your thoughts and what orders i should try to get against my mom and a deep dive on how those orders are going to help

i tried posting about this on the anxiety subreddit because this is causing me really bad anxiety and since i also have diagnosed severe ocd its not letting me live normally anymore but everyone just laughed at me and i got no help so that led me to deleting my post i hope that now i can actually get some help so basically i smoke no judgement pleasee i know its bad and im trying to stop but basically what happened is that more than four months ago i was out with a friend and we were waiting for the bus and while we were waiting for it i smoked a cig after i was done i noticed that we were standing in front of my dads friends workplace and he owns that place so he has access to all the cameras the thing is its not the smoking that im complaining about its the fact that my dad is an abuser and that he has made it pretty clear to us that if he ever catches us doing something like this he will actually kill us me and my siblings i didnt think much of it at first because my dad and this guy were on no contact for two years because of an argument they had but he reached out to my dad they talked but nothing about me still this has gave me severe anxiety and panic attacks during the day and im just wondering what am i gonna do if he ever finds out was this coincidence i mean whats with this timing right now my mum is headed to my dads workplace because he told her he needed to show her something i am home and i am actually experiencing an anxiety ive never experienced i dont know what to do but i think if he find out i might just call the police or run away but i dont think ill run away because i dont want to put my mum in that position

in summery at i dropped college and went into culinary school my toxic mother loves to manipulate me and always mentioned having a restaurant one day now to modern day im now and everything she ever said was for her own personal benefit not only did she not discuss with me the restaurant idea she has no idea how to run a restaurant i turned her down multiple times and it was the only thing she would ever talk to me about money and restaurant my mother would intentionally stop talking to me if i didnt do as she wanted she would even come by around midnight uninvited scaring me and my partner i worked in fine dining i specialize in french cuisine one day she brought up a restaurant opportunity to buy i took a look and said no due to the fact that it was a heavily chinese inspired restaurant and its had a new owner and name change that resulted in bad reviews taking this business is just straight idiotic she gets upset some days past she tells me theres another place i was forced to agree and turns out it was the same place she hosted a family dinner in public that whole dinner i mentioned ways to improve the place and concerns she takes it as an insult and lashes out at me infront of the whole restaurant till this day i still have mental break downs from that night i packed and never returned the restruant she bought only had one cook its a chinese place which consisted of over menu items its not the same culinary style i learned and if this cook gets sick or leaves its done for not to mentioned that she doesnt want me to learn how to make anything and wants to pay me under the table and commit tax fraud
so basically i f have been arguing with my mom f over stupid stuff for the past couple of weeks and one thing that kind of starts the arguments is that she has anger issues and she doesnt know when to stop an argument or drop the situation and im not saying im any better because ill sometimes do things that get her mad without realizing it for an example i would be in the living room with her while shes watching tv and ill be sitting there playing with my dog and she would randomly get mad or start cussing at me for no reason or when one of my friends are over shell start talking about how im such a bad kid that talk back to her when all i try to do is just stick up for myself because i know that what she does isnt right but anyway what happened to why she thinks im trying to break her and my dad up is because one day after my dad m got back from work i came downstairs to see him because he works all day and he actually likes to be around me i walk into the kitchen and i start saying hi to him and asking him abt his day but i dont know what or why my mom was mad about but when i started talking to my dad she started just getting mad because i was basically talking and she started saying how i need to go upstairs or get out of her face when ive basically been up in my room all day and thought itd be nice to go downstairs for a little bit but anyway i obviously said no because she was coming at me backwards for no reason and after i said that she just started cussing at me and saying how i need to leave before i smack you which was uncalled for because there was no reason to be hostile like that especially when i didnt do anything wrong but after she said that my dad started saying how she shouldnt be saying that stuff to her kids and how she needs to get some help for her anger and i just stood there quietly not rlly saying anything because if i did i wouldve probably gotten in trouble with her but after that i basically forgot about that until the weekend when i went over to my big sisters house to spend the night and when i got there she explained to me how my mom was saying ive been trying to get her and my dad to break up the whole week which i had no intention of doing at all but apparently my mom got the idea in my head that i was and im assuming shes telling everybody that and i dont know what to do so if anyone has any advice i would please like it bc atp idk if im doing something wrong or not
this happened a few months ago im starting to get more pissed about it as i think more on it this happened in december while i was at my mums house my father asked me where the led strips i had gotten for my birthday where and they where in my room a few minutes later he messages me with a photo of my room absolutely trashed shit everywhere on my floor and i even lost some of my rings that i had gotten on a trip to a cool place im freaking out because he has gotten mad over stupid things before and he has hit me for it i asked why he did that and his only reason is because its a dump thats all his reasoning i was asking questions on why he would do that and make me clean it myself and he gets mad and says the same shit i really wanted to snap at him then but if i did i most definitely would have gotten hit the next day i really want to leave his ass behind but i really just cant the most escape i have from him is the weekends when im with my mother but two days just isnt enough

long time lurker first time poster i was brought up in a middle eastern country so abuse of your children isnt really something discussed there i just turned and outwardly im doing ok in all reality though i am not my parents were divorced dad had sole custody restricted me visiting my mom mom was no better either constant shouting swearing every time i visited about how divorce had ruined her life almost made me fail high school because of that dad was no different just to give you an idea of how bad he is his maxim of raising children was simple children need to be terrified of somebody so they can fall in line to give you an idea i had an admittedly bad habit of nail biting as an year old my dad beat me up about it then threatened to tie me up and use a lighter to burn each and every one of my fingertips my dad refused to attend my university graduation ceremony from medical school no less because i had invited my mom i ended up not going at all thats not the worst part the worst part was that this abuse went on while i was a type diabetic diagnosed at the age of three and a half years old he would lose his temper at the slightest thing shouting and swearing he once told me to get out of the car because i lost marks on a math test in school i was years old i think threatening his own son that he would leave him on a random street corner he looked after me financially and obviously looked after my diabetes but his verbal physical and emotional abuse continued until i was too old for him to continue to do that my mom as i stated wasis no better when i did visit her she would spend half her time shouting and swearing at me and my dad about her divorce and my dads family and her own family from when i was or years of age maybe and up she once took me out to dinner when i was i think then slapped me across the face and left me in the middle of the restaurant alone because i begged her to stop constantly shouting at me down the phone these instances of abuse are not one off they were a pattern beatings were common with his hands and with sticks as well i dont remember a lot of that because i suspect i may have blocked it out i recently went through some career and health troubles and those coincided with an argument with my dad we havent spoken in ages but all of a sudden something clicked would my life have been different if i hadnt had abusive parents would i have made different decisions i just realised that nearly all of my decisions were based on keeping myself as far away from them as possible i immigrated halfway across the world and it still isnt enough for me because the timezones are not different enough i made some less than optimal career decisions to get away from my family that probably impacted my health in the long run the common factor in all of these was trying to get away from my parents i know theres no point asking what if but i need some validation i find myself doing all those behaviors that adults who were abused as children do constantly apologizing for trivialities overreacting to minor stresses blaming myself for everything that goes wrong even when its out of my power i would read these articles and watch these youtube videos and say im fine my dad and mom were abusive but i kind of escaped unscathed i just realised i am probably not fine these are the instances i can remember i am sure there are dozens more that i blocked out i dont know what i am looking for maybe some validation that its okay to thinkfeel this way thanks and sorry for the long post
my mom broke her shoulder and my dad has a bad back and now i have to do everything when im broken to i have cronic pain in my wrist and scoliosis that they wont send me to the doctor for even though i cant sit at the bus stop without a ton of pain and i just have to do it everyday my birthday was on monday the th and i got mostly money because i asked for that but they wont let me spent it ive been looking on amazon for bach and wrist braces but now i cant even buy that with my own money i went to a residential hospital for months for my mental health and now i get punished for crying or breaking down ive been trying to parent my inner child when im still a child just so my parents dont send me back
or to dread coming back to the house or to feel a pit in your stomach when its time to return the journey home should not be one filled with fear and the first step inside should not feel crushing its something of a sleepless night and there have been footsteps and voices outside of my room theyre ones that belong there certainly but it only ever reinforces that feeling of myself not belonging here like some misplaced object or a forgotten toy at the bottom of the bed a home isnt supposed to be one where every second is braced for screaming yelling berating and scolding where every conscious moment is tense and expecting it should not feel constrictive and it certainly should not be so isolating i realised today that its not normal to get anxious at the sound of footsteps
hey guys so a little context i am in high school and my mom has always been overprotective but its really starting to affect me now see she doesnt allow me to spend time with friends alone and idk why honestly also she comes with me to all my school events and dances and it just feels a little awkward since that isnt a normal thing in high school she doesnt even let me cross the street or go to our neighborhood park alone i dont think its because she doesnt trust me she just wants to keep me safe and thinks the world is a bad place i tried talking to her about i feel her being at all my school events not even letting me go to our park which is a minute walk without her coming with me and not letting me hang with friends is bothering me and makes me sad but all she does is yell at me and guilt trip me what should i do
hey so i fcurrently live with my parents and i think they might be abusive some background info when i was little i lived with my mom while my dad worked away i idolized him and loved him a lot and my mom and i had a great relationshiphowever when we were all living together i feel like he changed he gets angry very easily but has never hit me harshly or without me deserving it yet im scared of him and his yelling my mom also changed i feel like she might be a bitnarcissistic when i was struggling with my weight issues shed make comments about how shes less fat than me even though shes more overweight because shes shorter and would get mad when i pointed it out not to mention the constant comments of her looking way younger than her age and how great she looks while she often insists i get a nose job and other things when i get oldermy dad often calls me a dumbass for any mistake something he knows hurts since i practically live for academic validationmy mom also often times vents to me about problems with my dad and his family and how we hold her back from being happy however the instance i could say they felt abusive was when my dad got drunk refusing to give my baby sister to us and my mom kept yelling at him i then had a panic attack and my mom told me to just stop being dramatic and act my age something they have always told me whenever i did something childish they also tend to neglect a lot of chores specially my dad my mom does it but surface level only i really have living here specially with how my mom just lets food rot in the fridge and drying cloths smell like mildew she also told me that shed cut me herself and do it way deeper one time she found out i was self harming and when we argue shell go days without even speaking to me honestly i dont know if im just dramatic and theyre good parents because in all honesty they do buy me everything i need and even more anyways im sorry this turned into a vent i just need someones opinion
using a throw away account because yes basically i am homeschooled m and i constantly get into an arguments with my parents why homeschooling doesnt work or me talking about potentially having bpd since i every single of my problems and behaviour are matching it they either ignore me or you dont have enough experience adults always right they pretty much admit neglectbut dont admit the fact that i am only needed to show off my perfect cheated results and now abuse changed from emotional to physical i have got hit for the first time in couple of years hits by themselves didnt leave any long term damage just a little bit of pain but still i am afraid that it will get more violent or that i will kill myself because i have tendencies to cut myself a little child protection services arent an option since i live in a rd world country what should i do i need a solution to defend myself physically and mentally and a reason not to kill myself please help

op here f days ago as of last year marks the first anniversary of me moving out of state away from my insaneabusive family i want to not have to think about that situation too much anymore and move on with my life and have had moments this year where i still mourn the genuine good memories i had with all of them ive blocked all their numbers because i cannot mentally handle reaching out anytime soon i looked into the blocked contact settings on msg and saw my mother texted me again back in late february saying how i needed to be a grown up and at least say f off instead of ghosting them all that was felt was both sadness but pure rage underneath i never wanted to leave my family like this i still love them deeply but i also cant ignore how theyve treated me for the past years im not saying that i want to speak to them anytime soon but i just really needed to vent because its mentally exhausting to think about
im now i moved into my dads at years old after being in a toxic household with my alcoholic and i believe bipolar mother she would beat me scream at me and kick me out of her house i would sleep in my friends apartments stairwells she is much better now and im so thankful for that our relationship is not perfect but its better anyways obviously that would put an effect on anybody so young once i moved into my dads i started not caring about school gave up on really everything i went through a really bad eating disorder and my dad was never around not just physically as he was always working but emotionally too i remember when i was really sick and skinny he yelled at me for not eating and said if you want to go kill yourself then kill yourself and stormed out of the house i was really physically weak that day i had to use a lot of strength to walk he got me diet pills at i had a binging and purging problem he told me some days dont eat today we would fast together and at the time i didnt see anything wrong since i was sick young and niave i was raped by a guy that same year and that was the most hell ive ever experienced in my life i would be crying and screaming on the floor and my dad got fed up with me so he ended up choking me hes choked me a few times one night after he did it i was crying to him and saying i just want my dad i need my dad right now i was no remorse absolutely no compassion nothing when i was i overdosed and he knew but he left the house quickly when he found out telling me to deal with it myself he hit my dog in the face and he was once in his way and purposely kicked him to the side once he threw shoes on the floor right in front of his face i feel like he really failed me and neglected me he would never ask how i was doing or ask about my day or my friends he never got me the help i needed never said i love you or showed any care towards me i feel like that really messed me up and ive gotten into some toxic relationships with boys where ive been hit and emotionally abused and manipulated i would have a hard time leaving i just wanted love i dont think i have ever properly gotten it this year and a bit of last i started taking school more seriously i recovered from my eating disorder on my own i stay away from bad guys and rather stay single i dont participate in parties taking drugs or alcohol which i used to struggle with i just got a puppy so my days are full of taking care of him school working out and cleaning the house picking up after my dad i mean like oil all over the stove random stuff all over our kitchen stains and crumbs on our floor he leaves it to me and i reclean it everyday im also handing out resumes im really trying my best he always brings me down too by doubting me my future criticizing me my dad was always mean to me but it got really bad this year during arguments he will scream in my face get out of my house go on welfare live on the street i dont care i want you out and ill just be sitting there crying i dont ever even scream back i just sit there hurt again never any remorse or regret im a christian and i started focusing on god when i was he has really saved me when i was at my lowest today my dad he said i shouldnt call myself a christian since i dont respect him but i swear its not like that at all a lot of our arguments come from me bringing up something he does or says that upsets me hell just get so defensive and start screaming these things at me for example a month ago i told him something he did made me uncomfortable and he got mad that i brought it up right away he threw dishes at the wall and then screamed at me again to get out of the house i was crying and he shamed me on a call with my mother you should look at her she has snot coming out of her nose but in the moment i was freaked out and again i felt abandoned by my dad thats an everyday feeling and its really tough it always takes a toll on me he claims that im the abuser is he right he says it all the time and he gaslights me hes forgotten a lot of things hes done and why is that i dont understand whats wrong with him how could he do all of this to me and not acknowledge it plus make it out to be that im the problem i want to get out of this house just as much he wants me to ive started to actually fear him i tell my mom all of this but i feel like she doesnt listen to me and it just messes with my mind this was a big vent but i really need somebody to just listen and reassure me and give me advice i feel completely lost and emotionally drained it feels like this has taken a part of me im turning in a month i want to move out before he can legally kick me out because i know it will more that way so if i leave its better ive had enough of what he has done to me

my dad would wrap me up in a blanket and then drive his nuckles into my chest and hold my arms down with his other hand it would make me cry but he found it funny
so basically friday this week ill have to present an exam to a university my parents want me to go i havent studied at all my mom told me a month before the exam that she would make me try out and shes given me a book and some notebooks a cousin and my older sister made when they went to courses to pass the exam to that university but i really dont know if ill have time to learn it all or the energy to remember even most of it because i am having lots ot trouble focusing at all because its really hard to feel positive or see beyond my immediate present when its really clear ill possible be physically disabled if i dont treat my carpal tunnel and chronic ankle instability right now and the reason i have these conditions is because of child medical neglect for my ankles my parents didnt knowcare that ive always had a bendy and faulty right ankle i remember when practicing for school dances in middle school and when i was just walking like normal people do that my ankle would randomly give out and almost make me stumble but it wasnt painful it was just normal for me i thought everyone struggled with it it made me confused that it wasnt ever portrayed in media or in cartoons but i didnt realize it was normal then i dont remember or know when it started i just know its always been like this i didnt know it was chronic ankle instability i just thought i was always just stepping wrong and no adult not even teachers thought it was weird i was always almost barely not stumbling when i was in secondary school one day when i was really struggling with my endometriosis every first day of my period i used to puke a lot because of the pain that would only get worse if i wasnt covered entirely and cold got anywhere near me and that would leave me very weak because i wasnt feeling well and was very out of it when i was trying to go down the stairs i fell on the last step and i am pretty sure i sprained my ankle the only reason she let me stay home that day wasnt because i was barely able to walk but because of my endometriosis pain she could relate to my pain since her and my grandma on my moms side also dealt with awful disabling endometriosis i dont remember for how long but when i went to school i spent the entire time skipping on one leg and walking weird like that keep in mind that this isnt when my ankle instability started but the first time i can recall easily where i sprained my ankle i dont remember any other time in my childhood where i first sprained it just that one day i had lots of trouble walking because i would suddenly lose equilibrium but it was ankle instability in i sprained my ankle again in april when we went to a water park in another state and my ankle when i was going down a water attraction i mustve hit something with it idk it wasnt even really clear what happened to me because when i got out of it suddenly i couldnt really walk on it anymore they didnt take me to a doctor we just flew home the next day i think because i couldnt walk i dont remember at all this time in october of that year i sprained my ankle again and this time it was obviously a second grade sprain and my family was really awful to me so awful it was completely traumatizing i went to my moms room late at night to hug my dogs until the anxiety spike i had that night went down because hugging my dogs really helped my mignight anxieties and my dogs love my mom a lot so they sleep in her bed my mom kept nagging me to go sleep in my bed and after my dog walked away from my hug i decided to walk back to my room except i was really sleepy and relaxed and not really fully aware of my body and maybe it was because of my chronic ankle instability again didnt really place my foot right on the floor and i twisted it right beside her bed i stopped being able to feel my right ankle where i fell and instead of asking me if i was alright the first thing she said was oh great now your father who wasnt even awake when she made the comment he was still asleep and i wont be able to sleep for the rest of the night and i just cant stop thinking about all of the things that couldve happened you not being injured if you had went to your bed when i told you to and very meanly to me when i couldnt walk and i was very vulnerable keep in mind i was like years old at the time that night i couldnt go back to my room at all so i went to asleep in her bed and cried very silently and at one point i stopped being able to tell if my tears were because of the severe pain i was in or the deep sadness i felt at having to be born to a mother and a family like mine when i woke up the next day i had a huge bump on my right ankle almost the size of a tennis or pong pong ball most of all it was really noticeable because my legs have always been so skinny no matter what i eat and yet despite this that only week my mom allowed me to stay home and rest my father older sister and mom made sure it was absolute hell for me they were obsessed with proving that i was faking the injury and the pain when i did something out of muscle memory like trying to walk with my right leg and especially in the case of nd grade ankle sprains you need to rest for about a month of rest but she didnt want to let me rest that time she wanted me to go back to school and not miss anymore of it she didnt care about my wellbeing at all i think the most egregious example of her psychological torture she made me endure that week was that every day she came home from work she would force me to wear a pair of sneakers and make me walk from my bed to the wall opposite to it this was especially difficult when it was the first days of my injury and they were not taking it seriously at all during the eveningsmornings she would come to my room and threaten me that she was going to force me to go to school the very next day even when i literally couldnt even rely on my right leg and i was just so fucking scared because my school is very large and to get to my classroom and to get to the cafeteria theres a lot of stairs even now and then i had to walk a lot to get to these places even after i went back to school i struggled a lot with walking normally bc i had forgotten how to and was worried at how it looked i felt very embarrassed all the time they spent the entire week making fun of me for being in pain not laughing along me making fun of me and constantly insinuated that i was faking it which obviously fucking pissed me off trying to catch me faking everything and even neglecting me and doing lazily the treatments etc the last concern in their minds was my wellbeing i mentioned that they were not taking my injury seriously at all and because of this i kept begging for them to take me a doctor so one could speak sense into them i had to beg several times a day not only for them to take me but also toremind them that they were taking me to a doctor because they would forget my mom forgets a lot of stuff easily so i had to do it to her most of all me asking for help so insistently pissed her off a few weeks or maybe a few months after i went back to school she came to my room to scream at me about something and then she said you always ask so much of others and then you dont do your part you dont do what others ask of you in response to me literally needing medical attention because all of the adults in my life were being assholes to me while i needed their support the most and i just wanted to feel safe and like they cared about me they took me to several doctors because i always forgot to ask them how much time i should be resting and i thought that if my mom heard a doctor say what id been begging her to understand that she would finally grasp that injuries dont go away with time especially ankle injuries and that she would finally help me but she didnt after our visit with the last one because i had remembered to ask him how much time i should be resting she simply got back into the car and told me that i would be going to school next week anyways next week she only let me stay the monday of that week after our visit with the first doctor he asked for a radiography to see how my ankle was and if i hadnt broken anything major they took several days to take me to get a radiography and i tried to be considerate and not remind them all the time but its very hard when youre trapped at home and your only hope are the adults around you and how in pain you are when my dad took me a to a general hospital to take it he was very obviously drunk as hell and he even forgot to bring the note the doctor gave us that said which zone of my ankle they should radiograph me and i they took of the wrong zone and not the right one i think it shouldve been on the front of my ankle but instead they took it on the back of my ankle and they took it to a general doctor who probably didnt know what he was looking at and said it looked fine and that was all they cared about the only time they cared what a doctor said and yet i am still living with the pain on my ankles when doing things that didnt use to give me pain live laying in bed or having my foot supported on a wall or how much harder it is to sit crosslegged my ankles have definitely not healed right because of this i might have some form of tarsal tunnel or something similar like that worst of all my older sister was and still is studying to be a nurse yet despite this i was made to go through horrible medical neglect awful nurses start at home after all as for wrists i believe i might have some form of carpal tunnel or tendonitis or something like that i got my right wrist injured way back in like when i was trying to make the very problematic charger of my computer at the time would only charge at a specific angle charge my computer and it was ubicated at the left side of my computer and with my right hand i tried to move it and prod at it until it charged again but movements were very specific and tiny also i was frustrated and anxious because my mom had just yelled at me a very sharp pain blasted through my right wrist that left me unable to use my right arm for a day or two and because i was still in online school i just pushed through the pain and instead mightve also injured my left wrist too because ei had to use it instead of my right one who was out of sevice ive always been an extremely heavy handed writer so it wasnt like it came out of nowhere i was very scared of telling my mom because even then i knew she would either laugh in my face about it find a way to use me asking for help against me this fear was made real in october of the next year or try to hit me in my wrists when she got mad and started yelling at me when i was like years old we went to a water park with some cousins and when we were playing with a beach ball the thing people use to fill it with air hit me right in my cornea and punctured it my eyes naturally couldnt stop crying bc they were damaged and when we went home and took a bath and my eyes still couldnt stop crying my mom didnt ask me what was wrong or anything she just slapped me in my cheek and my eye later she took me to an oftalmologist and i kept an eye patch for a while while it healed and started wearing glasses because my vision was very blurry this is where this fear came from or minimize the very painful and real injury i had my only best case scenario back then was if she simply forgot i had said anything or just not telling her i couldnt write the same way and opening doors and many many things involving my hands became very hard all of a sudden but i sucked it all up because i was so scared of my mom we had a lot of my extended family coming over during the pandemic and my mom was very angry all the time so it was a very stressful time too i hope you understand that all of these fears and more were validated in october of that year that i wasnt irrationally afraid of nothing it was all true in the end this is all ommiting the severe physical and verbal abuse they inflicted on me when i was a young child and lead to me developing childhood depression and anxiety abuse which intensified greatly when i was younger than because an older cousin blamed me for his abusing of my brother when he was the one doing it but at the time i felt like i should be the one taking the fault because i stood by and laughed with him even though i didnt know what was happening and i didnt want him to pick on me me and my brother are twins so we are the same age and he is two years older than me i think and then hthat same cousin tried sexually assaulting me in my sleep and raping me when he thought i was asleep when i was i didnt have anyone or anywhere to feel safe so i didnt tell anyone and just spent the next years of my life severely spiralling constantly feeling guiltyashamedanxiousobnoxious and depressed as hell that year i was also being physically and verbally bullied at school so you must imagine the cocktail of emotional turmoil i was having and dont get me started on how all this medical neglect has made my depression all the more worse before my mom had ruined me mentally but after all the medical neglect and reazling how much she had neglected me my entire life i havent had shots since i was a child outside of maybe the covid vax and some boosters she only took me to a dentist until i was like and that was to take out a loose tooth that had been in my mouth all the way back during my sexual assault and longer than that because another was trying to grow there and it was very weird i realized she ruined me in body too that she ruined me completely and i couldnt escape out of it she only took seriously my endometriosis because she could relate to it but when i had very physical symptoms of something being wrong that when she got mad at me and tried to prove i was faking it and i wish she wasnt like this i am sorry if this is hard to understand i am very much in a hurry and need to go back to studying ive been thinking bout asking her for a gap year so my ankles and wrists heal properly and like they should have shes been taking me to see a doctor about my wrists problems because she wants me to be a programmer because i am in my computer all the time and ive told her about my ankle problems so i hope she takes me to a doctor about it soon too but i dont know how she would react i really cant look or focus on my future when the threat of physical disablement and pain for the rest of my life is always ticking above my head i dont know how to put it to her without mentioning how much she has failed me for so so so many years and how that has affected me without her not taking an offense to that she gets really offended when we speak of her failures i am really scared i am so scared edit i wont report because i am almost and authorities in my country dont care about child abuse its very ingrained in our society and i would probably just get raped if they took me to an one of these child rescues center and i obviously dont want that so dont talk about it it would take a lot of energy and i really dont have any i just want kind words
anytime im in the front seat of a car he does it so i sit in back and i hate sitting up front but i get yelled at for it and even whenever i broke down crying he didnt stop he still does it it makes me remember what people have done to me in the past
okay ive come with the terms of my mother being emotionally abusive and neglecting me but im still confused about other things and need to be more sure first thing is she dont straight up beats me but ive been slapped she pull my hair pushed my in fights squeeze my arm until it hurts a lot and give me accidental injuries that dont look accidental like in the car when im trying to take of my belt she will try to reach something in the backseat and with me with her elbow a lot of times and laughed and ignored when i did tell her that other things too just like give me a punch by accident and being so much clumsy around me she knows i was saed by years old but still do things like taking her clothes around the house and calling me to have my attention and joke about that sometimes be angry that i dont want to change in front of her or even making rake my clothes to show a new bra or idk also since i was a little kid she would watch adult films with me in the room and would at least make out with my father idk if more i was a kid and later in life make sex knowing i could hear from the room at the side she also when passing by me will grope my ass or like something like that also she makes a lot of comments on my body and my development even to her husband so i need to know are these other types of abuse too or just something else but not too bad
i dont even know where to start basically i grew up without a father i lived in my mothers message shop in the storage room i wasnt allowed out when it was open and only had barney on loop my mother occasionally sent me to a foreign country with a stranger she trusted to take me to my grandmother to which i spent half my childhood in i went back and forth across the two countries a dozen times and was never able to learn and master a language my mother one day decided to pay my uncle a big sum of money and throw me into a boarding school in this foreign country which i lived in for days straight and home to my grandma day after this repeated for a year i was unable to communicate due to the curve of learning two different languages my native tongue was mandarin at this school i lost so much weight to the point i cant fit in anything the boys and girls where separated in different buildings and felt like prison more then anything with walls having glass spikes and being locked in the room at night each room consisted of four bunks no tv nothing a thick bared window every now and then the home room teachers beat the students and so do the teachers i was bullied and beat for a long time and every time i went back to that school after day being home i cried and was dragged in by my uncle and aunt i was only years old i remember i cheated on a test and only gotten a that was the highest score i ever had i never progressed a grade one day i get a notice from the teacher that i was going home back to america from my mother whom i havent been able to talk to she told me that i have a new dad as well to summarize it my step father was years older then my mother and was a vet from the vietnam war throughout my life i was never able to connect with him and had been yelled at and choked one time even he even threaten to leave us cause i cried one day seeing kids playing fetch with their dad outside my window i went through schools and three states i didnt master english until th grade no present time nothings changed my step father became more understanding as my mother never changed always saying the same thing money i left and never looked back i wish i could tell more but it would be too much thanks for reading im definitely missing more major things
my mum is always telling me how she thinks i had an amazing childhood and how lucky i am when in reality she was never around to see that my father was abusive and that i was terrified of him she questions my choice to go to therapy and tells me its a waste of time i go once a fortnight and she thinks im not broken enough to need to go that regularly
it feels like a way for my mother to harass me receive piece of mind and an opportunity for her and her family members to contact me asking my whereabouts and to face them the police officer told me i owe it to her so shes assured im in in a ditch i shared that i intentionally abruptly fled the environment to a shelter for safety then was able to sustain my own home and now career im much safer and better off he did not care his job was to check on me and follow up with her that i am okay i asked how to prevent this from happening in the future i mentioned making a complaint and he told me to call the shelterwhy for giving him my address he said to pick up the phone when they call i do not pick up no caller id for my safety because my abusive parent utilizes that to try to get through to me it feels so wrong it should be wrong for this to happen i feel so unsafe and intruded upon in my safe space if i pursue a restraining order against my parent would this make the wellness checks stop

its just so obnoxious how all parents are portrayed as great parents and if you dont pay respect and or say how great they are then youre obviously the problem arent moms great so sick of these comments i absolutely love the great moms and dads but theyre not great just because they had a child i know it creates better workers but damnit its triggering
i hate him hes not working he earns zero money always alone on his phone watching youtube or playing chess always yells at least once because its not funny otherwise always hide behind the im your dad excuse to do absolutely nothing in this home cant even clean after him let me explain so as i was cleaning the living room he come home from his only friends house and he directly throw his jacket on the couch i ask him nicely can you put it in the closet and he replies with yelling and telling everybody how bad of an education we got because i was bold enough to ask him to clean after him today while we were eating my sister asks him if he wants a desert he says am i supposed to bring it here myself then not gonna describe everything but just know that he made my sister cry and still continued telling her how dumb and disrespectful she is i wanna kill him sooooo bad is there any way of making him leave the house please help me im being serious
im an older teen male and any time im in the car or in the room with my dad i feel really uncomfortable and want to leave and the sad thing is hes actually the better parent parents are divorced btw whereas with my mom i deal with physical and verbal abuse my dad has always defended me and been nice fun and caring but hes been such an asshole recently and he just yells at me and puts me down sm to the point where i hate being with him for too long hes never really hurt me physically that bad but i have had an odd feeling around him since a few months ago when he started being mean it feels like hes staring at me or something its really weird and ive never felt something like this before is this normal
does anyone else deal with loneliness feel lonely because your parents isolate you from otherscontrol who you can and cant talk to i do online school so that makes it hard even though i try to take advantage of the fact that most students are in my city and its good i have an education dealing with loss in the family as well and just feeling down in general im hopeful i will get better and i will get into a better environment any tips
this is mostly just a vent hope thats okay im doing a lot better since i have lots of support from the outside but its taking a while the constant gaslighting and general disrespect ive experienced since ive started sort of rebelling against my mom has retraumatized me for a solid years and i feel very disconnected from my already almost nonexisting family she has only rewarded me for my failures usually only materialistically as well and at the same time doesnt actually want me around perhaps because she knows i dont ive had to spend most of my money i was saving from job hopping for years on feeding myself because dinner stopped being a guarantee usually for me specifically even that food isnt guaranteed because nothing in my moms house belongs to me except for my medication its been months but i still grieve over the cat my mom gave away to someone else without telling me for over a week after it happened because she knew i was the only one that cared about her my mom has gaslit me an insane amount and threatened to tell my friends about the true me or whatever that means either that or send me away to some kind of psych ward i just feel invalid for all of this a lot but it helps that my irls help me during the times that i think im just faking it all or something im talking to my psych soon and im hoping i can talk to them about these feelings
as i write this im filled with anxiety and dread over the years my dad has made inappropriate and sexual comments towards me i have caught him staring at my chest when i was thirteenfourteen blatantly and multiple times when my mum has ever said anything about this like recently when he threw a cloth at me and asked me if it was my stockings he has immediately tried to intimidate her and got aggressive by getting closer to her and completely changing his tone then asking her if she has a problem as a result of her pointing out its entirely inappropriate i despise him he repulses me and all i want is for him to get the fuck away from me he has very high standards for me academically i think hes projecting sometimes and expects me to go to universityi do want to and im working towards it but he expects so much of me and so little of my sibling who is and still getting an allowance from him his favourite thing is to guilt trip my mum me and sibling with how much money he gives us whenever we disagree with him including earlier when he made the cloth comments im at a loss for how to handle this i have been for years i wish he and my mum would separate but she has said to me shes knows if she ever tries to hell get nasty as well as try take from her financially the only way i know how to deal with this is ignore it its all ive ever known im scared but i also feel like im blowing this out of proportion and shouldnt be i have mixed emotions what advice can anyone give or opinions my friends dont know and i hope they never do
palm sunday my mother passed away i live hundreds of miles away from all of the family as i went nc years ago shed been sick for a few years and i warned them all and mom to get her affairs and will in order nobody listened until the last second nobody except my sons ex wife helped mom with dr appointments and stuff cue the day of days after sons ex wife and my daughter now apparently besties took my moms purse and belongings from the hospital they were there so they were supposed to but they stole her credit cards and bank cards and emptied them leaving in savings because i got there too soon they took all she had saved to pay for the funeral costs my son and or the two girls went to her apartment because they were the only ones with the keys and began systematically stealing the very meager valuables and pawning them and my sister and i are guessing this was taking place before she passed away when i arrived a few days later to get things in order i found out that while i had a bit of help i had to clean her apartment by myself she was a hoarder and i was overwhelmed nobody knew where the funeral was or what time nobody had a meal planned for afterwards i took the to pay for the food and the pastor officiate after the funeral grandkids were coming to the apartment and just taking stuff tossing everything here and there undoing everything i worked so hard to sort my sister was handed the whole estate down to her acre and the condemned house garage absolutely packed top to bottom with more hoards i cant even grieve grieve the loss of a woman who openly and savagely hated me abused me and destroyed whole lives because of her selfcentered behaviors i dont know how to feel or how to let go im a damned mess now everyone is fighting and someone is headed to jail i just cant
so my dad has always been verbually abusive to everyone he will go in a cycle of anger for a month and then go back to normal for a few weeks except for this time we havent stopped all year i think he started at around middle of january well it got really heated in january i just want to know what i can do to stop this abuse its not physical and i will make sure it never will be but im worried it will turn physical with how he is acting so he doesnt yell at me as much more onto my mum doesnt complain about my chewing being too loud doesnt go off of his nut why there is a sock on the floor he wants everything to be so neat and tidy its ridiculous im not being rude to you but your house is a mess compared to ours we can never have things out on the floor for an hour if we havent touched it for a day it needs to be packed up i cant play my board games now as some of them last hours and it takes a few days he has been having road rage lately pulled out on a taxi and decided to chase him the taxi was in the right and he was suprised he was in the wrong could have caused a crash said he want to punch that moron in the face the other night did a stupid cast at a silly boat while fishing only to take my rod and reel and have it scratch along the rocks he is so particular about his items if they are damaged i put his phone down on smoothed concrete once in the garage he snapped said fine you can start paying for everything in a mad tone and his snap rage or what ever you want to call it is getting worse and about the verbually abusive stuff he will just go so mad yell at anything and yell at your face say super rude comments double standards its ridiculous little brothers st birthday and he was going aroud the house yelling at everyone cleaning the already clean house and then getting mad that we wrecked his birthday because we werent smiling on the camera we were all yelled at for hours how could we smile today my mum asked him if he wants to go for a walk he then says are you telling me or asking me mum goes just asking you we were going to go out somewhere wasnt sure if you wanted to come or had any suggestions dad well i dont know where to go so your telling me to go mum no not at all im just wondering if you want to get out of the house with the kids and i dad why cant i do stuff i want to do im always told what to do mum im asking you if you want to come or have any suggestions on what to do not telling you and it just rambled on mum ended up in tears and they left and my mum never raised her voice my dad sure did and he then fliped the argument as he always does and puts it all on mum so in short if we have a different opinion in his conversation he will yell he wants the house extrmely clean and tidy he has some sort of rage i get scared going in the car with him now and he says some awful stuff to me that i will never forget what can i do i have no friends at all im homeschooled so im stuck in the house no where to go other then work work is my only out im a myo turning yo
i dont really know where to post this and i dont know the age limit on this app but im just super eager to know because nothings been showing up on the web so im a female and years old my stepdad has always been a drunk since i could remember even when i was little hed do things to my mom when hed come home drunk like wanting to start a fight but it never really dawned on me how bad it really was i remember a time he literally took my moms phone and snapped it in half literally broke it into two pieces with his own hands but back in the fighting had gotten a lott worse constant yelling till am in the morning counters being slammed and me being freshly in middle school i was still a pretty young kid and obviously terrified so at times i did call the police nothing so major came after that except a cps surprise visit at my school and at my home which my parents yelled at me for but it wasnt until my little sisters birthday party that things had gotten real bad my father ended up physically assaulting my mother at the party and my sister raced in to help but when he got up to square up to her too her friend swooped in and punched him telling him to get the fuck away from her and of course after that my mother acts as if the assault charges are ridiculous now i thought we would be safe from this man and my mom promised he wouldnt live there any longer but when i returned from a visit to my sisters not even a week later he was sitting in my mothers bed watching tv with the most uncaring expression on his face my stomach sank and i knew that this would be a constant cycle of insanity from there on the dude never even apologized by the way or tried to make it up to us hes one of those financial abuse people and even in this argument he threatened to put us all in an apartment together and leave us a week ago on the weekend my mothers friend came over here to collect my dads friends money that he owed her so he transferred the money to my mother who then gave it to her friend but my father for absolutely no reason blew up and started yelling at her thats my money even when they tried to explain to him it wasnt at all i was asleep for this and i only woke up for the end of it i was told he attempted to hit my mother but instead grabbed her crafts and threw them across the room he also slammed the fridge so hard multiple times hed broken the shelves inside and glass jars now i have picture evidence of this but i dont know if i should share because the state of our floors lol i dont want anyone to come after us anyways mind you all these times are from when hes been drinking all day and recently the question came into play is he taking something thats causing him to react this way other than alcohol which brings us to now earlier ago they had already returned from a night out of drinking and were fine until we all sat down to just talk about things my mother and i were taking and his friend and him were talking she was telling me a story from her middle school days and for no reason at all my step father begins to say that he doesnt fucking care for her stories and that theyre going to bed i turned to him in disgust and went thats rude theres no reason to be like that and we went back and forth and he was like so im the bad guy and i went i never called you the bad guy at all all i said was its really rude to behave that way when someones talking me and her were in a conversation and you interrupting the way you did was rude and he just waved me off and i thought that was the end of it i thought i couldve slept easy tonight but no i was alarmed by the fearful cries of my little sister and the sound of something slamming against the wall so both i and my brother race in because obviously big sister mode i heard my little sister crying i was worried i got pepper spray and what i did probably wasnt the best solution against a ft tall drunk violent guy but i cussed him out loudly saying what the fuck is wrong with you what the fuck are you doing this got pretty scary as i was ready to be attacked or attack him since his mannerisms when he got up were concerning this is when he threatened the apartment thing too and kept pointing at my mom saying you fucking bitch and all this stuff oh but during that i accidentally rubbed my eye and started to burn like crazy so i was holding my scorching eye while shouting and crying eventually he left and my mother explained to me why he seemed to blow up which she was surprised and confused by a plastic pill looking thing it mightve not been shaped like that my mom isnt very knowledgeable on drugs with clear on one side but purple on the other and when she asked him what it was because she had no idea thats what caused him to blow up as he did now this probably just confirmed a lot of what we thought was true and im curious if maybe this is just some medication or actual drugs and if hes really on something thats causing him to act this way any ideas on a worse note my tv broke today and i was supposed to be getting a new one tomorrow by him but now i guess i cant because i didnt let my innocent step father abuse my mom in front of my little sister edit its the next morning and my mother and i talked some more his friend had called asking what happened and she explained to which he then said well our other friend takes something like that she responded well what is it and he said viagra i forgot to mention that my step father has a cheating past which caused the arguments from all these years to get so nasty because my mom would always yell about it when they were drunk and i said it probably hurt his manhood but there was no reason to act in such a way regardless to which she then responded he doesnt use viagra with me op so my mom definitely caught him in something but he basically ratted himself out by acting in such a way normally when violent fights like this happen they talk the next morning about it privately but he had ignored her completely this morning and left the house after showering and getting dressed which means whatever he got defensive over was the fact he was most likely caught cheating again
weird title i know my parents arrived home from the club and my mom was really drunk throwing up and such and my stepdadfor years was pissed about that overheard my dad just insulting my mom over and over again and trying to undress her so she doesnt puke on her clothes then saw he closed the light and then started to hear a weird macaroni sound ik dumb description that started to pick up pace and heard my mom moan and realised what was happening at that moment i wanted to burst into their room and start swinging on my stepdad but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and just went back into my room furious and deciding to just ghost my dad tomorrow and if he asks ill just start spewing everything that went and is going through my mind right now not really sure what to do just know that i am pissed and really dont want to talk to them tomorrow
hello everyone i am m i am from europe i live with my parents and my younger brother yo and we dont live in our country of origin but in a foreign one i hope yall spend a few minutes of your life and read this because i really need some advicehelp to get to the point my mum never let me go out but lately since things got worst and now that i am i want to leave but dont know how do plan it some context of the situation the first two times that i went out alone was around and that was in front of our house all my relatives knewknow that my mum doesnt let me go out that i have no social life and my father doesnt carewhen i was in school she didnt even let me go on school trips except for one time and that time my father and she followed me with their car on the whole school trip when i got to highschool things got different a little bit usually she would drive and take me from highschool but when her car got damaged i went to school by bus and thats where i had a bit of freedom and social life in may i asked my mum if i could go out with some school mates and a girl and after i insisted she agreed but she sent my father to watch me what i would do few days later my mum controlled my phone secretly and checked the texts between me and the girl i went out with and also checked her social media and my mum saw that the girl was a bit depressed had a few tattoos mediumshort hair and a few earrings my mum reacted by saying that she was in shock because i talk with a depressive punk girl like that and then she told to our relatives that i was part of a group of drug addicts which it was not true but my grandparents and the rest of relatives believed her from that moment may my mum told me that i wont go to that school anymore but because it was almost the end of the school year she let me finish there in the summer of my mum let me go around our little city with the bike at the end of august i tried to smoke my brother caught me smelling of cigarettes and told my mum when my mum asked me about it i didnt lie and told her that i did try a cigarette after this event she let me go out only when she would send me to the market which is minutes away from home then if my mum goes out she doesnt let me stay alone at home starts yelling untill i eventually give up and go with herand manipulates everybody around me in september she took me out of school i tried to go to school in september untill she did the paperwork for taking me out but she didnt let me when my mum took me out of school september i couldnt do anything because i was a minor so i talked with one of my aunts this happened still on around october and she advised me that i should talk to my mum and see why doesnt she let me out and that i should convince my mum to reenroll me in highschool and if my mum wouldnt reenroll me in highschool i should wait untill i am and then reenroll myself to highschool i did as my aunt advised me but no result came out so i had to wait to be my birthday is on th december and from september to december i didnt go to school at all and only went out when my mum would send me to the market or eventually when she went to out in august i started to call local highschools to inform myself about the reenrollment in public schools and the highschools told me that they wont accept me in highschools because by law i was no longer obliged to go to school so in september months before my th birthday i started to talk phonely to my uncle my mums brother to seek help and told him everything that happend then my uncle and i came to a conclusion that if i want to be free have a social life a normal life and if i want to continue school i should go to my country of origin and stay with my grandparents my mums parents and my uncle agreed to help me to go to my country of origin after i will be a few weeks later my mum found out that my uncle would help me and she convinced him not to help me anymore she lied to my uncle about the fact that she took me out of school and convinced him that i didnt went to school because i didnt want to and that she doesnt let me out because i only want to go out to go to parties all night get drunk smoke and hang out with drug addicts which is not true after some contradictory discussions me telling to my uncle that is not true what my mum says and my mum telling him that i lie my uncle said that he wont help me if my mum doesnt agree my mother of course did not agree to go with my uncle to my country of origin after my th birthday december i decided to talk phonely and seek help to my grandpa my mums father that lives in my country of origin i told him that my mum doesnt let me go out that she took me out of school that i tried to seek help to my uncle to get in my country of origin but my mum told him some nonsense and he didnt want to help me anymore my grandpa said that my mums actions are wrong and that first he wants to talk to my mum and secondly that i have to come to an agreement with my mum when my grandpa talked phonely to my mum my mum told him that everything i say is false and that actually she didnt let my uncle take me in my country of origin because she wants to go too in our country origin and there is no sense in me wanting to go with my uncle a few weeks before she goes then when my grandpa asked about the school thing she lied in two ways firstly she said that i lied that i didnt go to school and that actually i went to school then when she saw that my grandpa didnt believe her because i was constantly saying that my mum took me out of school my mum changed the lie and told to my grandpa that i didnt went to school but only because i didnt want to which is not true then about not letting me out my mum lied and said that she actually lets me out but i dont go outwhich is not true then my grandpa said that i have to wait and go with my family in my country of origin and when well get to him we will talk more about the situation my family and i arrived in our country of origin on st december we stayed at my grandpas house and i talked about the situation with my grandpa and with my mum present because thats what my grandpa wanted in the discussion i told him that the problem is that my mum talks to me really bad that she doesnt let me go out that i have no social life because of that that my mum doesnt let me go anywhere not even to the gym or to practice a sport and that she took me out of school since september my mum would contradict me and say that i lie and that i actually went to school my grandpa believed me after he asked my mum to show him my report card from highschool which my mum didnt have in any way because i didnt go to school thats when my mum changed the lie again she said that i am right she actually took me out of that school but because she wanted to put me in another school because i smoked and i was part of a group of all punk girls and boys that were doing drugs and that group started to influence my thoughts which is not true from that moment everybody started to doubt what i say except my grandpa i told my grandpa that i want to remain with him he agreed and so my grandpa said to my mum that she must enroll me to school in my country of origin around thth january my mum tried to enroll me to school in my country of origin but lied that i cant remain there because my school transfer paper was not valid and that there was no other solution but to go back with her in the foreign country to a private school at payment where i would recuperate the two lost school years by the end of may i didnt want to come back in the foreign country but we eventually came to an agreement with the help of my grandpa in which my mum lets me go out normally and she would reenroll me back to a private school in the foreign country so i can recuperate the lost years of highschool in a few months from january to may i came back in the foreign country even if i didnt want to my mum enrolled me to that private school but is located kilometers miles away from the city in which i live with my parents but now here back in the foreign country my mum again doesnt let me out not even for a walk i go out only when she sends me to the market or when i get my monthly haircut whenever i ask her why doesnt she let me out she answers with who said that i dont let you go out are you insane i let you go out but you dont want to go out and thats what she says to everyone else but when the moment comes to go out and i tell her that i wanna go out she says no where do you go if you go out you dont come back no you wont go out because you go to search drugs or lately she said no you wont go out because what if someone manipulate you to suck a dick what you going out for to suck a dick i never touched drugs i never talked or was friend with people who dodid drugs and never will and i dont know from where she got the idea of sucking a dick but clearly she got some problems now my mum sometimes says that she wont pay my private school and to go wherever i want or to go to work to pay my school but when i am looking for a job and eventually have to meet for the job interview she tells me not to go because we will leave the city we currently are in and will soon go in the city where is located the private school or on the day i have the job interview she takes me out of town with her because she have stuff to do but actually she only goes to shopping and again if i want to stay at home while she goes i cant she starts yelling untill i eventually give up i posted once before a month ago not knowing what to do and most of people advised me to leave i talked phonely with my grandpa a few days ago and told him that i want to leave he told me to resist and not leave now and wait untill the school year ends which is in june so we can see what happens my grandpa said that if i leave now my mum would again say that its my fault and that there are less than two months until june and he knows i can resist ive been thinking about my situation and i also tried again to talk calmly to my mum and see what the problem is why doesnt she let me out why she indirectly or directly impede me to work my mum answered the same i see that this situation will never get better as long as i stay with my mum and as long as i am not independent so in conclusion i want to leave get a job a rent and become independent free i will do this after the school year finish june so i can have time to plan everything well but i dont know how to plan it how do i do leave my mum is always at home with me so she sees everything i do how do i leave do i pack my things and just leave without telling her do i tell her a few hours before i leave i dont think that is a good idea telling her weeks before because she will try to impede me who do i tell that i leave when i will pack my things she will see so how do i do then before i leave i have to plan where i will go there are summer jobs with accomodation here in the city and the cities around so i think thats the option i have looked for jobs and mostly are in the city that my mum lives but do i look for jobs here where my mum is living or in a nearby city when i leave i am sure that my mum will call me every second and also tell to our relatives most importantly i dont want my mum to have a shock when ill leave i know she reacts badly because a year ago after a discussion with my mum she broke my phone and i just left for a walk my mum took the car and looked for me in the whole city and also called my relatives about it when my mum found me she was on the phone with my grandpa crying and my grandpa told me to not do that again because she could have a shock and there would no one to take care of my brother so how do i leave
i made the mistake of thinking i could be involved in a decision that directly affects me not at home rn but im going home tonight which means tomorrow my dad will pull me aside for a lecture usually when this happens hell yell a little and then talk down to me while i pretend to agree with his opinion and pretend like i was in the wrong but my plan this time is to speak my mind to put it simply im scared last time someone truly spoke their mind to my dads face it was my brother and he got kicked out at im just barely a minor so i dont think my dad would kick me out but that just means hed keep getting angry he used to use socially acceptable ways of hitting like spanking and slapping hands on my siblings and me as kids but now that im a teen spanking wouldnt be considered at all socially acceptable i wouldnt put it past him to hit me though it all feels so unpredictable do i go through with my plan to speak my mind my life wont be in danger from him so id be relatively fine and im so tired of walking on eggshells to please him and my mom my younger brother has two more years in that house too how is he gonna deal with that alone idk what to do
im and have recently opened up to my psychiatrist about the abuse i was put through as a child it includest threaths hitting ripping from my arms and hair being left outside alone for hours yelling constantly beating as humiliating punishments for things like crying i can tell more if someone asks but thats that in short today i came home from the library and my mom told me she received a call from child protective services today and they told her everything ive told my therapist my heart basically stopped as i specifially told my therpaist i dont want my parents to knoe what ive said as they get incredibly angry for telling things about them my mom says half of the things ive said arent even true and that im just lying but i remember those memories very cleary she accused me of lying but im serious ive only told my therapist things i remember for sure im very sensitive and of course started crying and she just said so its all my fault and left she also said shes done everything for meshe doesnt abuse me anymore stopped when i was around or but she also takes from me every month for my foods im turning next month please please help me what do i do the cps are going to visit next tuesday and im scared my mom is beingg accused of child abuse and i dont think itll ever be the same in my house again i thought therapists werent allowed to share information ive told her unless its life threathening she also asked me if i want to involve a police and i said absolutely not what do i do are these just very accurate fake memories or is my mom trying to make me believe that stuff didnt happen please help i just dont know what to do
someone was offering me a new computer from another subreddit and i couldnt get it despite being completly free because it might not work and why do you want a hunk of plastic you should get a laptop and they also got mad because my friend had sent me a little bit of money to get parts that it needed not only did i have to explain to the person offering it that i basically live in a hellhole but now people are telling me to just get a job despite me being disabled i have some mental illnesses some from trauma they told me to wait until soandso time but whenever i earn money from selling things they take a part of it people are also telling me to go and get it anyway but its not that easy i dont know what would happen but im afraid of what could i feel like im in a cage what would anyone recommend if there is something i can do
erm
i am a british muslim at my parents tried to convince me that marrying my cousin from my home country was the right thing to do so i left to go to university far away against their will over the last years they have done nothing but manipulate me and lie in a bid to keep our relationship i travelled home this easter as i normally do for a few weeks to see my siblings much to dismay i find out my younger brother is getting married to our cousin from back home im astounded that he thinks this is a normal thing to do and ever since i have expressed my disagreement with this they have done nothing but guilt trip me about not being there for one of the most important times in my brothers life and even saying that me moving out is against our culture i am sick of being made to feel like a disgusting person just for wanting my independace and disagreeing with blatant incest this is so common amongst uk muslims and im tired of it getting brushed aside when i return to university for the remainder of my final semseter i will not be returning home because i am done
my mother verbally and emotional abuses my paternal grandmother her motherinlaw she uses words like whore bitch etc for a year old woman she makes my grandmother do a lot of housework from morning am till night am everyday she makes a year old woman clean her own bathroom while continually verbally abusing her she occassionally also physically abuses her slapping choking this has been going on for my entire life my dad doesnt do anything he does not oppose his wife and has been letting this happen in our house for decades he is a huge coward my mom emotionally and verbally abuses me as well but not as much as she abuses my grandmother when i was younger the abuse was worse but after i went to college for under graduation ug it reduced since i have been away from the house ug work and post graduation im living with them again and i feel traumatised by the horrors in my house the screaming and the humiliation of a year old woman my mom emotionally and verbally abuses me too and i cant fight for my grandmother because i will be probably be abused and mainly because my dad will not support me or take my side and my grandmother is super traditional we are indian and kindhearted she will never do anything that spoils her sons name in society so she will not come with me if i try to take her im sick of this hell i dont think i can do anything for my grandmother or for myself by being a part of this family i have a job now and will be moving out in a month but i still cannot bare to be the daughter of that awful sadist woman i want to understand what options i have should i report the abuse of my grandma and try to save her given the above context would i be successful should i get legally emancipated from my parents should i file a restraining order i tried to record the abuse as much as possible i have audio recordings but it is hard to get video evidence because my mom is sharp and hiding my phone in the kitchen where most of the abuse happens is difficult some help on spy cams or other devices to capture evidence may be helpful i need emotional support and strength to face this and get out of this my therapist told me to wait it out and not fight because a person like my mom cannot be reasoned with how do i get strength my culture has ingrained in my brain that parents are equal to god
i just cant i dunno how am i supposed to study and work when its still ongoing my headache gets worse i have a job interview tomorrow and i think i will just disappoint another employer with my depressed face and social anxiety but i need this job to escape this situation i also need to save siblings because they get this shit too shit
when i trying to talk about my family changing current job to new because the current job is completly exhaused im young at the end of s its just customer service alone and just more sitting nothing intresting monotony for example my aunt says what do yo do at work then you dont like to do anything at worklike psychical work if i talked about after job interview then aunt said about new work like this oh the new work is hours work now you dont have a full time job at your current job after all you get what you want in current job you go to work later etc they allowed you go to school and finish it ive taken half of the workload because i couldnt go to there even a day but i cant find a new one at the moment then grandma said that you are still half workload thats nosense its not good for future why they dont want me go better but to suffer in this workplace like i have no one to talk to there my workmate is moody over i am not asked anything and there is no one to talk to friendly things like how you going they are just like why you are not in your place or what do you walk here
i have been dating this guy for months he knows me and my father arent on talking terms but doesnt know why i really want to open up to him about my childhood abuse but i am finding it difficult to start the conversation i dont even know what to say
my step father used to randomly open palm slap me in the foreheadtypically many times a day and declare me baptized i think it was like a joke or something but he was really weird and i never quite understood him he had no religion or religious affiliations anybody got any imput
i used to live with my father who was very abusive and neglectful im glad i got away but i think about why he did the strings he did to me all the time its like my father wanted me dead and he had plenty of reason i still think i deserved everything he did to me and sometimes i think i shouldnt have left because i dont deserve better is that weird
alright so i dont know what flair to put this under but i need to know if this is abuse and i need to know what to do and how to get us both out not just me for context my fiance m has a traumatic brain injury im f i have adhd and cptsd were both dvsa survivors from previous relationships and i fled my narcissistic mother in december and severely abusive ex in november my fiancs parents are taking me in temporarily not getting into this it doesnt pertain im sorry if this all over the place my fianc jesse has had to deal with corporal punishment especially in elementary school his dad would hit him with a belt and his mom would put soap in his mouth a few other things but thats all he can remember for now remember he had a tbi he was afraid of his parents as a young child because of it and has flashbacks and when his dad yells hes like a deer in the headlights he freezes and we suspect he dissociates but like were waiting for a psychiatrist to evaluate him separate issue theres spots on his body i cant touch because it triggers flashbacks and he physically feels like its happening all over again when he was in middle school he came to them suicidal they dismissed him and said what do you want us to do about it theyve actively seen his sh in the past and he relapsed a day before he met me for the first time we met really late june of he was even thinking about ending his life around when we met hes told me im why he stayed i struggle too with sh and his dads literally asked me if i was done cxtting yet right infront of people his parents know im a dv survivor and his dads yelled at me and gaslit me by saying ive said stuff i didnt say and jesse and i both know i didnt say it and i told his dad i know i didnt say it and he said you were probably off your meds or something then his dads also said i can function without my adhd meds and that its laziness and im not trying hard enough his dads also told me employers dont wanna hear about my adhd my medication is a prescribed class ii stimulant thatll test positive for amphetxmines so yes i do disclose it as a precaution and i also disclose that im asthmatic and keep my inhaler on me i have a morning adhd medication and an afternoon one so disclosing it also puts that within my reasonable accommodations his dads straight up yelled at me and it caused jesse to freeze like a deer in the headlights jesse dissociated from what hes describing thats what likely happened i have dissociation myself and again were waiting for a psych to evaluate jesse and it made me feel so unsafe that i actually started hyperventilating and started fidgeting with my hands before i was distressed and his dad verbally attacked me for it and for not finishing my plate of buttered pasta which i didnt take much of as i wasnt feeling good and when i went to pack it away he said watch she wont even eat it i have a psychiatrist and am in active therapy both were horrified by this jesse wont tell them certain things because he doesnt trust them with it i advised him not to tell them about the dvsa but he didnt listen and theyve already tried to use that against him jesses dads like walking on eggshells his mood can change at a drop of a hat his dad when he sent me into a panic attack told me my dad who was soft spoken and mellow and never raised his voice to me would agree with him raising his voice to me to which i knew otherwise his dad and mine have never and will never meet obvious reason being my dads dead i ended up saying respectfully my dad wouldnt agree with another man especially a father scaring his daughter so much that shes nearly peeing herself he raised me that the minute the volume of your voice makes someone uncomfortable youre raising your voice to them apparently jesses dad was raised with never raising a voice to a woman but yet im a woman and he yelled i ended up reaching out to one of my dads friends who sided with me and told me he never knew my dad as loud or anything like that and that i know my dad better than anyone my dad had parents like jesses especially his dad he didnt want to be like that to me moving on to jesses mom she literally has said countless times he gets one shot at moving out and he aint comin back and theyd shut all his stuff off when he does leave they dont give him info on stuff hes had to relearn stuff like taxes or whatever cuz the crash she uses the crash as a justification and constantly says he doesnt know how to do this the crash took that from him wont allow him to make appointments or advocate for himself wont teach him anything wont stick to her word with anything and if he does ask her to show him she doesnt tell him the truth shell purposely confuse him ive seen it shes told him that his brains younger cuz the crash but told me his brains normal like age appropriate and i saw papers saying hes cognitively his chronological age ive tried to help him and she terrorizes me like gets extremely passive aggressive example i had him ask for his w tax form cuz i was gonna file mine and i had a free tax agency do mine and she refused to give him his form and kept it from him and menaced both of us and stayed silent on him for days i had voiced the idea of him and i moving in together and she was like oh state insurance doesnt work like that uh i know it does cuz my ex and i had to file that way and jesse and i arent legally married so in the eyes of the law were the equivalent to roommates and she tried gaslighting me on that and tried throwing a bunch of info at me to scare me and overwhelm and confuse me and it failed she also treats jesse like hes cognitively like his brother who has a delay but turns around and says oh jesse is fine she wont respect his boundaries and jesse has been terrorized to the point where hes afraid to voice himself cuz hed literally get the belt as a kid for it its not normal to be afraid of your parents as a child as far as i know in my trauma therapy sarcastic comments are a thing too from both parents the meds thing his dad said to me the jesse is used to living a certain way he wont change it from his mom then scaring him immediately into submission by trying to scare him by bringing up finances and lying to him she said hed have to pay car insurance and some other vehicle costs his car is titled to her and we know shes not gonna title it over to him and he cant file for car insurance if hes not on the title meanwhile shes telling him hes gonna have to pay for it when he leaves see what i mean shes not honest with him and gaslighting me his mom literally intimidates him and stuff to the point hes afraid of stuff and gets overwhelmed fast and freezes exposure to abuse can make ur brain foggy too its common and im certain jesse has it because i had it in my situations so i know the signs she said shed help him with his dental appointment and like said months ago that oh its emergent its emergent but like forgets to stick to her word and if anyone holds her to her word she gets passive aggressive and even more controlling only reason she did anything with his taxes yesterday is cuz tax seasons ending soon i filed mine months ago and tried bringing him with me to where i go and she refused to give him his w and when we both asked for it she threatenedmenaced both of us and refused to give it to him ive tried helping him and she found out cuz jesse keeps getting her involved im guessing cuz the prolonged exposure to this kind of abuse and the fact she keeps withholding info from him that he needs that im unable to get i have experience with this it makes you feel helpless and youre petrified of anything different cuz all you know is the toxic hes not involving her in his psych stuff i told him that he has a right to his privacy and explained hippa to him and everything so the only one on his forms is me for it currently his parents literally wont allow him to make his own decisions and they scareconfuseoverwhelmthreatenbullybelittleberate him and if he does make his own decisions they pretend he doesnt know what hes doing and wont help him with anything jesse has aphasia and some memory issues from the crash and his mom literally wont help him with his words and belittles him his grandmother her mom said it was abusive and mean and told her to stop and she still hasnt they criticize him constantly put him down so on i handle his aphasia by throwing synonyms and antonyms to him along with some goofy phrases which get him to laugh and he finds the word he wants a heartbeat later pre and post crash if he made a mistake or got confused about something theyd say stop acting rtarded jesse hit a deer in august or something and he asked them to help him file an insurance thing cuz like the car titles not in his name nor is the insurance theyve refused and like his dad didnt hear the situation out like hitting deer happens its life your kids alive there couldve been far worse id rather the deer get hurt than your kidhitting the deer in this situation was inevitable and his dad belittled him and even me and was like i dont wanna hear it do better and no ones helped him file anything theyve said theyd shut his phone and stuff off when he left too he has no current savings as he had to pay a credit card bill his mom keeps calling him a certain nickname and jesse told me recently hes getting tired of hearing it hes told me and her before its embarrassing and he doesnt want to be called it which is why i never say it take a guess which one of us is respecting his boundaries and voice me shes said veryyyy personal info about him to me like the thing yesterday about how he were born thats just part of it i have a hard time recalling info as i suffered a moderate tbi last saturday and chipped parts of my skull so pardon me if im repetitive or vague his mom has said other weird stuff and i notice she repeats herself about it all if anyone says anything or does anything she gets mad she was rambling to me about him and his childhood and crash and so many other things yesterday when we were transferring our phone data over to our new phones i switched carriers and no im not on their plan i couldnt keep up with her and when i excused myself to pick my phone up from the dining room table she got weird even though i was polite and came right back to where she was she doesnt like people sharing anything about themselves or actually having a normal conversation ive noticed his dads the same way they both ramble and no one can say anything at all edgewise not like i would try anyway i dont give them much personal stuff about myself because ive dealt with people like this before his parents especially his mom brag about knowing him so well but they didnt notice he had a massive drinking issue and was very suicdal just before his crash part of what i see is jesse is basically a caretaker he has to remind them to take their own meds they esp his dad wont remember to do it otherwise he literally puts their heated blankets on organizes their pill boxes so on his love language is acts of service everyone like his doctor mechanic so on are friends with his parents his mom literally refuses to leave the patient room when he goes to the doctor and justifies it by saying she just wants to know whats going on and i know jesse sees this stuff as normal and none of it is his moms said good luck getting him to move out hes used to living a certain way before trying her scare tactics on me they scaretry to intimidate his partners and some former partners and friends so on have actively said that his parents scare them they scare me anyone thats not connected to them like kids from family friends or whatever its a massive issue and theyll do anything to keep them away jesse literally told me he was isolated as a kid if they cant control who hes around theyll try to get rid of them jesse has told me he saw them fighting like yelling and stuff pretty often he ended up getting fed up once and slammed a door infront of them and only then did they stop because they remembered they had kids around them jesse has told me if we had a kid in the future not now obviously hes anti corporal punishment he didnt recognize it as abuse until i came along and he sees the you get one chance to move out because youre not coming back after the fact thing as abuse and he doesnt want that for a future child they dismissed their sucidal child in middle school but expect comfort when they bring up his crash especially his mom im confused because she was not the one in the crash he was it also seems like they have two different sides to themselves the one people see in public and this stuff jesse told me weeks ago that they wouldnt give him his birth certificate or anything they literally use the fact he gets confused and overwhelmed easily against him cuz they know if they manage to do it to him he wont be able to say anything against them he wont be able to voice himself based off what jesse has described to me it seems like this makes him nervous and he cant stop worrying im trying to tell him that someone doesnt have to lay a hand on you to be abusive and parents are never done being parents until they die hez tell me constantly that he feels like he owes them and he dont he had no say in being brought in the world there are things parents are obligated to do and providing for their kids is one of those only reason they stopped hitting him is corporal punishment became illegal in our state and when he turned it became assault he couldve pressed charges and fight back jesse has told me he never had someone who wanted to stay and wanted to really know him and who was able to tell him whats abuse and whats not a few nights ago his parents have spun him around so much that he actually has a really hard time picking up on signs of abuse it seems like theyre trying to scareoverwhelm him and make him as dependent on them as they can so he wont leave what do you guys think how do i get through to him have any of you gone through this what advice can you give him is this abuse how do i help him see this how do i get him to come with me so he doesnt have to deal with this what kinds of abuse are occurring here if any how do i help him see that this isnt normal i told him to come to a dv shelter with me because i might not be staying with them much longer because of my situation that has nothing to do with his and theres a chance i wont have anywhere to go past the th of this month were both in pennsylvania usa

english is not my first language so bear with me this will be a long post i need to provide some context about my relationship with my father he is a big red walking flag my grandfather abandoned my dad and his siblings when he was my father always says he has done a better job than his own father because he didnt leave i wish he did my father is the typical macho man who will start a fight if he is challenge plus he believes its my moms and is responsabilities to tend to his needs because he deserves my father used to leave me without eating the whole day because he is so self centered that he wouldnt notice i didnt eat he expected me to cook for myself while he had take outs i was around years old i never told my mom but one day my older brother who is years older than me found me crying on my room and well he found out my father hasnt feed me since he left in the morning my father gave me a nickname it means monster in my native language if i make a mistake or dont agree im called stupid idiot useless or my fav one piece of shit he was never there when i needed him and i needed to beg for his attention i dont receive hugs and the rare occasions it happens it cant be more than seg he has never said anything nice about me he always fights with anyone of us brother mom or me so everyday is like who will be the target today he respects my brother more because my brother is a man and im a female seems like gender decides the respect you are supposed to receive he only cares about himself and he usually expect to receive the best otherwise he feels insulted he likes to look at himself in the mirror several time a day to admire how handsome god made him his words not mine so before anyone asked no my bf doesnt have any plans to get married because he is scared of ending like my father cheating on wife im trying to convince him to go to therapy well we had a fight days ago i cooked pasta and he said he should have ordered something because it was not what he was expecting mind you he only pays the triple bundle internet cable and tv dollars he has a pension for in the house im the main breadwinner since i make more money than my brother we pay for everything besides what my father pays i told him he didnt have to eat it if he didnt want to he went crazy he called me a piece of shit who thinks im more important than shit he called me stupid and a lot of other things but i talked to my bf and he said something shocking to me do you know of your issues are from living with your family its true if i were living in another place i wouldnt be going through all this craziness and it finally clicked my therapist told me you can love someone and they can love you back but that doesnt mean they are toxic to you i stupid me love my family including my father but i realized i dont love myself because why dont i remove myself from the source of my problems i promised myself than no one will be allowed to put my freedom in danger my freedom to choose my freedom to be myself and to be at peace in my own house i just wanted to share and tell anyone who read this its ok to leave its ok to put yourself first it is not selfish its time to love ourselves and if you have to cut off communication or go low contact to be happy or in peace go ahead im typing this while doing a budget to move out as soon as possible im not sad but i feel excited of this new adventure so if you want to give me any tips about living alone ill really appreciate it
i have a lot of trauma to sidt through with not just a narcissistic father but repeated betrayals from various exes and friends my dad gave me massive abandonment self esteem and trust issues i have made two of my best friends in college and theyve been helping me finally process years of repressed trauma they do a lot for me but im jealous theyre happy but im not and worse yet i cant escape this anxiety so i only ever bring the mood down they can only have fun without me does anyone else feel like this i feel trapped by his abuse and i feel like my friends cant have fun with me i sometimes feel like putting my walls back up so that i can be happy again help
my parents are emotionally abusive i defended them from my friends criticisms for years but i eventually came to terms with it when i was around im now and i just went to tour colleges in massachusetts with my dad over the weekend i thought we had a nice time and i tried to be as nice as possible engaging in friendly conversation with him and trying to bond but on the car ride home he turned off the music at one point and told me he wanted to talk he proceeded to spend the next minutes telling me that im a disappointment and that the reason hes never that impressed by my academic achievements is because hes disappointed in me as a person he thinks im a miserable person who makes everyone around me miserable and ill never be happy i was able to avoid crying until he brought up my grandma who died when i was and whom id always avoided because i was scared of old people since he knew ive always felt guilty about that he told me about how when he was younger nothing made him happier than making his parents happy like when he performed at the kennedy center and all he cared about was that his mom was so happy seeing him perform whereas i didnt even want my parents at my school play i really did want them there and cried when my mom lied to me that they hadnt gone and he brought up how hes and in the last decade of his life and doesnt want me regretting not appreciating him while he was alive i just dont get why i feel so guilty about disappointing a man whos emotionally abusive i want to make my parents proud and be an honorable son but i know that i wont be able to thrive in life until i cut ties with them update i decided to take a chance on my mom and tell her how hurt i was usually i just try to keep my emotions inside at risk of starting a fight with my parents and her immediate reaction was to tell me he was probably right even as i cried and told her that i just wanted her support for once she said she couldnt just pretend to disagree with him i feel so lonely i just want someone to comfort me like when i was a kid
today my mother asked my dad for help with some sort of media player which wasnt working because the subscription had expired and there was a lot of trouble trying to get it to work again unfortunately i was dragged into it and had to act as the middle man translating what my shouting dad was saying to my mother on the phone along with this my dad was basically interrogating me on why my mother was having issues with renewing the subscription he has anger problems if that doesnt seem relevant i answered one of his questions and he got really impatient with me and basically called me stupid and started swearing at me as usual this time i got really angry and stormed off and shut my door to my room so that i wouldnt have to deal with his shouting i could hear him swearing and knew it was directed at me because he was saying my name and calling me stuff its am now and this happened just before we went to bed im dreading waking up and i dont want to go through tomorrow as hes going to be really angry and bitter towards me how do i get through the day without any problems sorry if this is too long u can skim through to the end
im and autistic my parents have always been physical the earliest times i can remember are my dad beating me because i was misbehaving as a child then it progressed to him grabbing me by the neck n other areas also slapping from my mother as well as shoving and numerous threats threats towards me and my dog they say theyre going to shoot him sometimes or purposefully poison him in hopes that he dies from it anyways i couldnt take it for so long i started cutting i was sent to a mental hospital but even then my father still says im being dramatic and i have no reason to be suicidal hes verbally told me before he doesnt care for it i remember we got into this huge fight and i was actively showing him my scars while sobbing to him about how bad his actions and my mothers were hurting me even then that wasnt enough for him to care i remember crying to him about how much i hated him and now we dont talk at all that fight was only a few nights ago theres a lot more but i cant get the energy to write it all i will say though its emotional and physically abusive in my household between threats and yelling and terrible jokes thrown at me i cant handle it ive gotten so much trauma from it i developed a disorder similar to did i just need advice i have no idea what im doing anymore
first post on reddit ever because i really need some help if im being honest i have no clue what im asking like i know ive been abused but my mind is like broken from it and i have all these weird fears and dreams because of it basically im and ive lived with my parents my whole life and my dads always been abusive he has like bpd or something because there is no way hes sane he throws his weekly hissy fits and fights with my mum almost every night in their room and im so scared when it goes quiet like i know that its never going to happen but im still scared that my dads stabbed my mum and hes gonna come into my room and kill me next cause he hates us and its so stupid because i know he would probably never do that but im still scared shitless and also my taste in men is horrible like ive never had a crush my age only teachers and actors who look like they could hug me and tell me they love me but also strangle me and kill me if they want to i just really need someone to love me cause if no one does i might just go fucking feral this is what im talking about i need someone to love me or i cant function i need someone to tell me they think im perfect otherwise im going to kill myself its these things i cant do anything about what if no one loves me what am i to do then i need help on this how do i stop feeling so needy of things my father never gave me and how do i stop being scared and imagining the worst things every night
she would clarify that she didnt mean her kids of course but i think i kind of grew up internalizing this and i would agree with her because kids are generally loud and scream and cry etc and i was a very quiet and reserved child so was my brother i started repeating the things shed say about kids especially jokes about violence towards kids who misbehave and i would say how much i hated kids and how gross and annoying they are i think it even put a rift between me and kids my age because i would judge them for acting immature which was really just them acting their age ive since grown up and realized this is a very immature and unfair perspective to have towards children and no longer think this way but my mom hasnt changed does anyone else have parents who diddo this i dont understand why youd have kids if you hate them what if i wasnt the well behaved quiet kid that she wanted would she have hated me too
i was physically and emotionally abused throughout my childhood and still to this day though it is less physical and less often as my parents are now divorced i confided in my ex boyfriend about this we had a bad breakup and recently he messaged my dad and told him that i had told himmy ex about my parents being abusive my ex never met my parents we were only together for a few months my ex was also abusive towards me though a lot less severe than my parents i am so hurt that he has told my dad this and cant understand why im not sure if he wants my parents to abuse me or if he doesnt believe me although he has seen proof obviously this has made thing a million times worse between me and my parents and my dad has started being physically abusive again i never thought i would want to tell the police but i am now debating it however im scared i will be come homeless ive only just graduated from university
ive delt with abuse my whole life im now and my parents split apart when i was they were both abusive onto me but was better when they split my dad was emotionally abusive and physically i dont visit him often because of how toxic and narcissistic asshole he is ive debated cutting him out many times and havent gone full through with it in hopes he would change which he hasnt in the slightest i cant even be my own person without him criticising me for the way i look the way i dress judging my lifestyle and puts me down for not staying at certain jobs the list goes on but hes such a negative and toxic influence on my life and ive reached my breaking point im no longer going to let him abuse me mentally any further my grandpa on my dads side is creepy disgusting man he makes inappropriate jokes and comments towards me and comments like oh i like your body take a spin around and got upset at me when i told him i didnt want to go dress shopping with him ive told my dad about this and hes defended him saying oh hes old he doesnt know what hes saying and put the blame onto me that im in the wrong and i should understand my mum doesnt understand how this effects me and expects me to come to events and that its rude not to because its family and shit im done putting other people first before me and going to family events to please my family i want to put my mental health first and prioritise my needs
do they act this way to their friends when they mess up if they didnt have a child would they be happier why would they have a child if they know it can be a hassle if they hide this behavior in public why do they only act out on us are they doing it intentionally were they treated like this as a child or do they think its regular parenting if they werent treated like this when they were a child how did they end up becoming this way so many questions very few answers
first post here sorting some things out in my adult years and wanted to know if i was overreacting to some memories or if my stepfather emotionally abused me i was a pretty good athlete growing up probably diaa level my stepfather was a big basketball guy and wanted me to play as well i was pretty good and probably could have gotten a scholarship had i cared enough i told my parents that i didnt want to play anymore when i was about and my dad threatened to not allow me to play other sports that i enjoyed if i didnt play basketball he also told me that if i didnt play basketball that he wouldnt pay for my college or help me in any way financially despite making about k per year i ended up getting cut from my high school basketball team right before my senior year after a talk with my coach who saw what this was doing to me i was a pretty angry teenager and definitely pushed my luck with some poor decision making luckily i had excellent grades and ended up going to college at unc ironically a basketball school i graduated with about k in student loan debt because i didnt qualify for any federal aid stepdads income and zero help from my parents i feel like im on the right track with my life now but ive been emotionally withdrawn and have a hard time connecting with people i have a great job and even managed to pay off my student loans despite turning parts of my life around i still feel kind of messed up over the whole thing was i emotionally abused
hi ill keep myself anonymous for this but im non binary and my mom makes me feel like im not even important to her by the way she constantly belittles me but then expects for me to love her she screams at me in public stores over the phone and calls me a bitch almost every day i have a father but who left due to my moms actions which i dont blame him for i dont think my own father even loves me anymore he laughed when i told him i love him yesterday today at pm my mom asked for me to go to the store for her then gets mad at me for when i call her to confirm what she wants i ended up getting what she wanted after she screamed at me i honestly believe that this is my sign to end my life my career isnt important anyways i dont feel wanted anywhere i go im sick of my life and sooner or later ill write a suicide note and right it in my blood since she wants to keep treating me like im an object i want to end up in anything that will take my life i honestly cant stand to go through this life style everyday i want to run away or die shes also called me a bitch lazy useless slow and a beggar idk what to do during these times anymore
long post tldr my mom got drunk had sex with my dad and then psychically assaulted me now she is telling everyone a different story and im starting to doubt if im in the right here edit i have made two separate posts from this with what the facebook post was and a couple of images of some of her abuse towards me dating back to i am posting this on behalf of my younger sister as she cant get into her own reddit account for anyone who saw my own personal post about her me just turned f mom dad sister and hailee older sister hey guys i am coming here for advice because i would like to know if im the asshole or not i would like to open this by clarifying my mom and i dont have a good relationship she abused me while she was on drugs and has been psychically violent my whole life towards me my sister her other children and my father i was removed from her care at a young age due to her psychical violence and history with drugs all of her children stay with her own mother for the reason she has abused them as well and my sister and i stay with our dad i have worked through many of my issues regarding the past i would say i am over it now what happened has happened and the future and present are what matters to me however what i am not over is the fact her behaviours have still carried into the present she is still extremely psychically violent is it really not letting go of the past if its still happening the other night my mom came over at around am her cat was sick and was going to be put down at am so we wanted to let her spend the night with her cat before she had to say goodbye my mom started drinking she kept telling my friend to drink as well although she really didnt want to i had two cans with her and that was it my dad asked my mom to stop drinking and she started screaming at him about not telling her what to do my friend witnessed this and was extremely uncomfortable and i was incredibly embarrassed anyway they went to the vet and i stayed home with my friend im not sure what happened between then but they came home seeming okay they had to go down town so my sister and i hung out with our friend until they left they went down town for about eight hours and my mom came back with more alcohol okay whatever she is a grown woman and is responsible for herself if she wants to drink knowing it doesnt agree with her thats her choice we tried asking her to stop and it didnt go down well i had been attempting to sleep but all i could hear was her crying and rambling probably drunk although i am not sure i dont want to claim she was in case she wasnt then i could hear her yelling and my dad asking her to stop and so obviously i got up and no i shouldnt have but i was sick of arguing at this point and i told her to shut the fuck up which maybe wasnt the right move but during our other arguments that night she also spoke to me incredibly disrespectfully and i told her if she wasnt going to talk to me respectfully then i dont see why i should have to talk to her respectfully i know some people believe you should talk to your parents respectfully anyway but i am an adult now and believe i have the right to ask for respect from her especially if she wants it in return something she also firmly believes and tells me all the time but doesnt uphold for herself she said sorry and we calmed down and everything was fine and i went back to my room to attempt to sleep again fell asleep for a bit and woke up to very loud sex okay adults have sex thats fine i told them i could hear them and told them to keep it down they acknowledged me but did not keep it down i could hear them acknowledging that i could hear them so l decided id ring my nan and ask if me and my sister could sleep there and yes i did tell my nan why and what was happening and i did explain i wasnt really bothered by the sex itself just annoyed that they knew i could hear and was trying to sleep but still didnt keep it down i was completely willing to not say anything else and just rant to my grandmother as l packed up it was my mother who came out yelling at me despite my dads protest and asking her not to because i was leaving with my sister anyway but she came out yelling at me and insulting me telling me i sook about everything and to shut the fuck up i told her to leave me alone and they were dirty probably not the best move but i was incredibly sick of her yelling at this point she kept getting in my face and i told her to get the fuck out of my face and so did my sister she said whatll you do if i dont and i said ill show you what lll do and i had intentions on ringing the police on her because i wanted her removed from the house because i was unbelievably fed up with the arguing she grabbed me first she is swearing black and blue that she didnt but she did grab me first so i obviously retaliated i am not a minor anymore and you cannot put your hands on me without it being assault i am allowed to defend myself so l hit her once and shoved her to get her off of me and she would not get off meshe had me by the back of the hair dragging me up the hallway and she slammed my head into the wall three times my dad has come out and pulled her off of me and i have told her i was ringing the police on her for putting her hands on me she with the knowledge the police were on the phone was still screaming at me and the operator could hear her so they pretty much rushed there and i told them what happened the officer could literally hear her calling me names and whispering things about me and so could i insulting me saying im a stupid little cunt of a kid and etc i went down to the station to make a statement and got an avo on her or well was more or less told there was an avo being put on her i think because they heard how she was acting they were required to for my protection im not sure how it works she cant come near me now but she has posted about me on social media and not told the full truth i really want to know if im in the wrong here should i have rang the police on her i have videos and heaps of evidence regarding her behaviour that i have also shown the police hence the avo i believe she has claimed my oldest sister hailee came up yelling about how disgusting she was even though that did not happen my sister was having a mad laugh and thought the situation was funny i am not sure why she feels the need to lie i believe my mom only tells people what she wants them to hear she is trying to have me charged with assault even though i did not assault her only defended myself just like every other time she has hit me and i have defended myself or when she has hit my dad and i have defended him this is probably going to be a stupid question to anyone with an outside view but am i wrong here i am constantly being told by her that i have no sympathy for her i dont support her mental issues i dont love her for who she is i think she is getting into my head i just want to know any non bias opinions and thoughts my dad is on my side so is my nan and my sister but im not sure about my other sister she always tends to believe my mom because my mom cries to her and makes her feel bad at least thats what i think she does my mom has blatantly lied about me to the police and to my sister claiming she is going to charge for me for lying about being molested as a child which is a low blow seeing as she knew how that event affected me as a child she cannot prove i lied about that it happened when i was eight and also she has no evidence and im pretty sure she cannot charge me for that at all she has been this way for as long as i remember having sentience i have only just turned eighteen on the th of march and i am at a loss of what to do legally and morally i know she cannot come near me due to the avo but im starting to wonder if im in the wrong here somehow i am sorry if this is a stupid question but i am really lost and starting to doubt myself i feel like this is on me for even letting her come up to begin with so am i at faultthe asshole

my abuse by my own father began years ago it was the springtime when it began i remember because it was past spring break at school i was in the th grade thats when my father called me to bathroom in my parents bedroom he was naked and touching himself thats when it began thats definitely not when it ended though i only wish i could say it was a one time thing i think thats what angers me the most and why i cant forgive him because it wasnt a one time thing or a misunderstanding or whatever bullshit it was a regular and deliberate occurrence at least weekly anytime that i was home alone with him was a time i could have been molested i dreaded time off with him during summer break or whenever my mother wasnt around my mother worked and my father knew exactly when shed be home and often times when hed molest me he would be completely naked except for his casio watch so he wouldnt lose track of time it was deliberate and calculated hed attempt to entice me with pornography dirty magazines hard core porn movies etc i was when he started doing this i was still playing with toys and not aware of anything like that i had no understanding of what was going on in those movies showing me porn became a routine to try and excite me into participating and then touching him or performing acts i absolutely wanted to vomit before during and afterwards when i was i began to have pain in my gut i would get severe anxiety and would become nauseous and throw up my mother assumed from too much junk food in reality it was because i dreaded my father assaulting me further when i was i was caught shoplifting a dirty magazine at a video store my mother picked me up she yelled at me for embarrassing her and for doing something so disgusting she told me how perverse these magazines were the police officer who detained me shamed me for this too as did the probation officer i was assigned to i wanted to tell everyone who i developed a porn habit from that it was my father who showed me every piece of filth he could find by the time i was i knew who most of the major porn stars of the day were i should have said something when i was asked by the police my probation officer and especially my mother but i didnt as part of my probation i did weed and litter pickup for the city every saturday for a month all that for a dollar copy of penthouse magazine i quietly did my penance to society and accepted a lifetime ban from the video store and didnt say shit of course i wasnt going to say shit my father was a man with a violent temper he had beat me several times before so there was no way id ever say anything hed also conditioned me groomed me that this was normal behavior between fathers and their children i was barely able to bring any of this up a year ago i think acknowledging what happened was good for me ive also spoken with a couple of survivor groups i wont say im better but i think im starting to deal with it better getting it out helps

turned in january have been bombarded with threats of getting kicked out and physically harmed since i was but it has dramatically increased over time parents have heavily withdrawn financial support and have been doing this since i was but i feel the lack of financial support now more than ever want to move out as soon as possible i know i have to work but besides working can i get some tips on how to move out as quickly and smoothly as possible months left of senior year and i dont wanna drop out to work but id be lying if i said it wasnt on my mind i know theres a lot of ways to make money remotelyonline so id appreciate any remote work tips any flexible scheduleseasonal work tips any gig work that i could pick up that would help me bring in as much money as possible im more into unconventional ways of income im picky about where i work always have been regardless of the life threatening positions ive been in i know thats not the best attitude to have in this situation but id be lying if i said im willing to work anywhere at least im honest with myself about my emotional and mental capacity i just dont see myself working a part time customer service job of any kind but i do have some other part time job ideas that suit my mental needs i am just wondering if anyone has any unconventional ways to make money besides the ways i already plan to part time job i already do a paid internship which gives me hours of pay every two weeks that is my most stable form of income right now but even that can be a bit unstable sometimes because on a tough week im only given or less hours in a week pay period does anyone know about any emergency housing assistancesupport any emergency government programs i can apply to to get out of here as soon as possible the government may not consider my case an emergency since im technically not homeless and still have a place to stay but i just want to know about all the resources out there ive looked at resources already but it seems like it only applies to people in more dire situations than mine such as people with kids and people with disabilities at risk of homelessness ive thought about applying for food stamps and disability but i dont know if my diagnoses are serious enough for disability support plus i still want to work but i dont know if ill be able to work and recieve disability at the same time i am having trouble with providing food for myself my mom still helps with buying food but when shes upset at me i notice the amount of support drastically decrease i do not need my livelihood to depend on someones moodthats how its always been and im sick of it my safety and my stability and my bare minimum needs have always depended on my parents mood i shouldnt have to worry about you withdrawing the parental support i shouldve been guaranteed since birth as soon as youre upset at me i shouldnt have to worry about my most important needswants not being met just because youre angry thats sick she also canceled my follow up psychiatry appointment today without me knowing that was another wake up call for me i had to change my medical accounts passwordcontact info to prevent this in the future but she may still find a way to get into it especially since im still on her insurance she will probably call my hospital every time i try to schedule an appointment on my own and make it extremely hard for me to receive any kind of medical support does anyone know of any medical services that would fit my situation besides the ones ive already looked into such as medicaid because shes threatened to kick me off her insurance in the past and this type of behavior only reinforces what she said she has bluecross blue shield plus other types of medical insurance so if im kicked off her insurance it will be hard for me to find help she is insured through her job so her kicking me off her insurance is for more of a malicious reason than a financial one i dont talk to my dad even though we live in the same house and havent since due to a series of incidents where he put my life at risk ever since ive stopped talking to him hes stopped financially supporting me if i ever needed money from him id have to ask my mom to ask him and even then the answer was rarely yes he basically became a deadbeat after i set boundaries and my mom has always supported his decision to stop financially supporting me cause in her words you love his money but not him you can use him for his money but not talk to him he has feelings too i live in chicago if that matters im wondering if there are any special programs vouchers housing info online job opportunitiestipstricks that dont require a hs diploma obviously any info that anyone can give me id appreciate whatever you knowthanks i cant stay here i dont know where im gonna go but i cant stay here i could go to my grandmas house but theres barely any space for me thereand i dont want to watch the ongoing alcoholic and drug addict outbursts that frequently go on i just want a space of my own i need a space of my own
so my mom has been physically abusive for as long as i can remember to the point where i was one of those kids who thought it wasnt abuse shed never punch us granted but she left hand prints on my face more times than i can count and once openly told me that getting whooped with the belt didnt make me cry from the pain but because she was the one inflicting the pain ive somewhat made my peace with this i know its wrong but at the same time shes my mom and i cant change her she went through it as a kid and never knew how to grow from it so she became it im not saying that makes it right im just saying i dont resent her for it any more ive just accepted it part of the reason i accepted it was because she changed when i moved out at she went from being overbearing and abusive to helpless and manipulative and made me pity her it kinda went from awful to just being annoying her texting me multiple times a week asking me to drive across town to buy her cigarettes or groceries was better than her hitting me so whatever i knew she was still hitting my sisters and i did all i could to be there for them as well as trying to be there for my mom because her mental health actually took a decline due to an autoimmune disease that i dont fully understand but apparently her immune system is attacking her skin cells in her legs and its turned into a necrotic open wound and has caused her a great deal of chronic pain up until recently i feel like i was doing a pretty job of being both a father figure to my sisters teaching them to drive and deal with emotions and all that while also being what i consider a good son to my mom and helping her through her struggles recently she went to the hospital where they cut out a huge chunk of the wound and packed it with a wound vac i brought her home from the hospital and her and my middle sister immediately got into a fight ive made it clear that i wont be involved in yelling matches they stress me out and dont solve anything so i left and went to pick up some groceries for my mom when i got back mom told me that she was kicking my sister out so i took my sister back to my house a few blocks away from my moms house and that was that my sister is so when i went to work the next day i just let her stay at my place apparently she decided to sneak into moms house to get her stuff and it got physical my sister called the cops and the state is pressing charges against my mom im trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and continue to help them both the way i have been and let them handle their own stuff and neither is trying to make me choose sides they both know i want to help everyone as best i can but i feel guilty being there helping my mom after her abuse has progressed to this point is it wrong to still care for and worry for my mom while all this is going on im at the point where im genuinely scared shes going to kill herself because this is the absolute lowest ive ever seen her
hi both my parents were killed in a murder suicide when i was i had other siblings of them went to their bio father and me and my sister went to my aunt i should be thankful for being adopted into family but im not my childhood was hell my aunt physically and mentally abused me and my uncle sexually molested me my earliest memory is of him touching my penis for no reason around age i remember he was supposed to be applying a cream to my chafing in between my legs i got curious about why he started touching my penis my rash was inbetween my legs not on my dick my aunt was unfortunately worse to meshe didnt sexually assault me but she physically and mentally abused me its hard to say that shes worse because my uncle sexually assaulted me my whole life but he was the one that would try to get her to be lighter on me she abused me for anything i did wrong i had a learning disorder growing up instead of taking me to get a checkup she would hit and ground me as a child i remember being grounded on summers my godmother and godfather would take me until school started again these were the best childhood memories i had i was supposed to be grounded while at their house per my aunts rules but they never abused me or followed through with my aunts orders later on in my adulthood my god parents told me they hated the way my aunt treated me so thats why theyd take me for the summer my uncle would molest me at nighttime when he was drinkingas he did every night i would try everything to stop him from coming in my room at night i would even get loud and yell get out trying to deter him from waking everyone up id sleep in my jeans only to be yelled at and grounded by my aunt for sleeping in jeans id figure out how to put a baseball bat between my door and water heater so that the door wouldnt open id always wished someone would catch him it never happened as a child i understand now that my uncle was being nicer to me than my aunt because he was grooming me when i turned i had a growth spurt and was finally big enough to defend myself from my aunt and uncle they both realized that and i moved out of their house at i was homeless for years i barely finished high school because i stopped going id find myself sleeping on my friends and familys floors sometimes anyway i got a good job at a major dealership in town when i left i went from being a car washer at to an auto tech at at age i purchased my own home i also invited my sister and cousin my cousin is one i also grew up with my aunt and uncles bio daughter to live with me they accepted anyway as we were getting the house set up i dont know how it was brought up but my sister mentioned my cousins father and how he molested me i was flabbergasted at how she knew i never told anyone when i asked her how she knew it she said she remembered me yelling at him to get out my room at night when i was young anyway my cousin denied it and moved out she even stole my cat when she moved because she had one and didnt want them to be separated whatever anyway i had a breakdown because i thought if my sister heard it then my aunt must have known it and ignored it i ended up in the hospital for a suicide attempt i eventually told my story to the onsite therapist the therapist then told me itd be best to tell everyone about my childhood so when i got out of the hospital i started telling family what he had done to me as a child then i informed my aunt and i was surprised that she had my back i went to confront him he was drunk of course and denying it when i brought up evidence he acknowledged that he didnt remember because he was drunk a few days later my uncle committed suicide one part of my horrible childhood was finally out of my life i never wish death upon anyone but this was a relief i still have dreams about him being currently alive and abusing me those dreams terrorize me still anyway i moved to a different state for a year to help some friends with their business when i got back i had another breakdown and ended up in the hospital again so i was broke and no job i needed a place to stay i didnt have many people to ask because of their living situations but i asked my aunt to live with her in her new house i thought she had changed just before i asked her to move in i was approved for ssdi so id give her of my ssdi check every month which came out to around she didnt ask for any money i just started paying her every month i didnt have much at the time and couldnt afford to give her more anyway ive been living with her for years now at years she told her daughter how she didnt want me there her daughter has anger issues and sent me a half paragraph text telling me im taking advantage of her mom there were some ridiculous accusations like shed need to redo the basement bathroom because of me so ridiculous for some insight on that i have ibs and spend a consideral amount of time on the toilet so i only use her basement bathroom because i dont want to stink up the upstairs bathroom that text pissed me off so much again instead of coming to me and asking me to move out she sicked her angerriled dog of a daughter on me i dont hate her daughter but she was the spoiled one growing up and had always gotten what she wanted growing up she also has always had anger issues so in my mind she told her daughter because her daughter is overprotective i was ready to just leave but after some thought i decided id take my time she was the one who fucked me up as a child and shes the one who refuses to tell me to my face to move out so id thought id wait until she told me to my face to leave yesterday it finally happened after years of living with her im ready to leave because i dont like living with her she just always seems fake to me i cant forget about my childhood being raised by my aunt and uncle im still not ready to move but im looking right now im terrified of change but it has to happen i dont know how well ill do finding a place for a month but i will be happy to leave and never see her face again ive went to my states website that helps people with disabilities find homes for cheaper wish me luck im open to questions that delve deeper feel free to ask sorry for the long post but i feel much better writing this out and getting some helpful feedback
i know my mother is a narc she makes everything about herself loves to portray herself as a victim projects her insecurities on me doesnt have a shred of empathy or sympathy but expects those things from others and lastly shes so full of herself and views herself as the most beautiful and perfect woman in the world but what about my dad he has a huge inflated ego and thinks very highly of himself hes also dismissive of my feelings and health issues and blames me for getting sick like my mother both of them expects sympathy compassion importance and attention from me but they are always ignorant or dismissive when it comes to my pain and feelings they yell at me for not always helping them in household chores and always says that how lazy i am for always not coming to their help but when i do they behave rudely with me and snaps at me my mother says youve done enough go away my father makes faces and gets irritated and says i can manage in a curt tone they accuse me of being a lazy and an ungrateful brat to their friends i just cant figure out what to do and what they want from me
so my parents never really believed in doctors and especially not in mental health issues but since becoming an adult and taking my healthcare into my own hands ive been diagnosed with multiple things both mental and physical the majority i havent told my mom because i just dont feel like dealing with it but when i do tell her things usually because im worried my younger sisters who are still in her care have the same issues and im trying to get her to get them treatment or at the very least assessed for it she then has me list of why i have it as if i have to prove to her i have it she then goes off about how she deals with all of the same things which leads to her either expecting me to console her or her lecturing me about how shes lived her whole life with it so im just being a baby and need to get over it i dont want to just tell her she doesnt have it even when its very obvious she doesnt because im not a medical professional and i know shell use it against me but i cant come up with a way to divert the conversation away from that and show that my symptoms or what im dealing with is different it just feels like im talking to an incredibly selfcentered wall she also has other responses as well like saying im just trying to upset her or put more on her plate by claiming i have these health issues but i dont have as much of an issue coming up with responses to these as i do when she claims shes inflicted with the same thing any help with how to deal or respond to this would be helpful
this is a repost from my old account im sorry its a long post but i just needed to write it out i f have been in therapy for years growing up i had this horrible rage i didnt really understand tbh i was a horrible sibling to my sisters and my bio mom as an adult i now understand why i was the way i was over my life ive been diagnosed with adhd ocd bipolar and bipolar depression seasonal depression general anxiety ptsd and cptsd not to mention i was diagnosed with bpd when the man who i call my father passed away when i was my sperm donner raped and molested me as an baby and toddler i havent seen him since i was but jennifer bio mom knew something had happened and put my in therapy the thing is she never told anyone in my family my sisters grew up thinking i was some awful person when i was just a child whos body and emotions were constantly reacting to my trauma when my memories came back years ago i told jennifer and her response was thats not true youre lying that never happened even though when memories of my molestation from my babysitter also came back years prior to the rape memories jennifer told me thats why she put me in therapy she knew something had happened i grew up crying myself to sleep every night because jennifer taught me it wasnt safe to cry elsewhere if i cried around her she would tell me stop crying or ill give you something to cry about i grew up being the villain in the family i take responsibility for how i was and who i was im not that way anymore but my family will always see me that way growing up jennifer refused to acknowledge that i would be acting out because of my trauma that no one but her knew about and i grew up learning i was a burden and my emotional needs were never met by her granted she would always fight to make sure i had medicine and therapy but that was all she did for me i grew up terrified to tell her i was sorry for something because she would say you should be sorry and then tell me exactly how i messed up and throw it in my face i grew up being so scared of her i would try to hide my mistakes so i would t be berated when she finally told me and my sisters about why she and my bio dad tom got divorced it was because he went to jail for child pornography and having am affair with our year old babysitter the same one who molested me my sisters and i learned tom would constantly beat and sa jennifer as well she never dealt with that trauma so there were so many times growing up that she would tell me youre just like thomas when my illnesses would flair up my sisters only got depression from tom and jennifer i got literally any and every mental illness and physical illness that could have been passed down so i grew up believing i was as bad as a rapist and someone who beat people i mean granted i already hated myself but that didnt help i grew up being forced to go to the mormon cult and i never felt comfortable being there but i grew to realize that if i wanted to feel like i fit in in my family i needed to conform to the churchs ideas and standards hell i would wear vneck tshirts at a family gathering and i would be told to cover up around my bils um thats fucking gross that my sisters wanted me to cover what little cleavage i was wearing around my brothers the man i call my dad david he came into my life when i was he was the man who taught me to trust men again it took over years to actually trust that i wouldnt be hurt but david become my whole world he was my best friend and my protector he knew how much i was ganged up on from my sisters and jennifer and he would always go to bat for me even when i had messed up he was in my corner not to say he wouldnt discipline me but he would do it with love and not by making me scared like jennifer would he was he first person in my life that chose to see me for who i was and love me unconditionally he had children from a previous marriage and when they turned he would help them but tell them their an adult and to go live as an adultbasically kicked them out but he had told jennifer that i would probably have to live with them after i turned and that that was okay when he died i lost it and the trauma was so huge for me i was diagnosed with bpd less than a year after his death jennifer sent me to a school in the mountains i had become too much for her to want to deal with i admit my only emotions in the household were to either be dissociated or anger flare up from my ptsd and bpd but she chose to send me away to friends houses all the time and then eventually sent me away i didnt know i was going until minutes before i arrived there i was told i was going on a road trip the school she dropped me off at was so horrible that just this year after a decade of leaving im able to truly open up to my therapist and be vulnerable about what happened ive worked my ass off to be able to be who i am now and where i am however my family only ever continued to see me as who i was jennifer is a covert narcissist due to her trauma and she would always make me the villain and her the victim i knew if i wanted to continue to be in this family i would need jennifer and i to go to mother daughter therapy there were things that we needed to heal from but she still didnt know how to communicate with me in a healthy manner so when i asked of she would be willing to go to therapy to be willing to learn to communicate in a healthy manner with me i got told that i was the problem and im the one who doesnt know how to communicate after my final straw happened i went no contact with her my partner heard the way she spoke to me and berated me and he was floored after crying in his arms i knew i needed to get away my step dad and jennifer had been made aware that if jennifer continued to talk to me the way she does and treats me that way i would be forced to go no contact i knew going no contact would mean i would lose my entire family the most heartbreaking was that i lost my nieces and nephews tbh i stayed longer in that family than i wanted to because i didnt want to lose my nieces and nephews but even now sisters grandparents aunts and uncles and cousins dont know what tom did to me as a child jennifer refused to ever tell them and now the will never know they will always think of me as the villain and never understand why i was the way i was what sucks is jennifer and steve told everyone i cut off contact because she physically abused me growing up but thats not true i made it very clear as to why i was going nc hell i even have the screenshots to prove that i told them it was because of mental and emotional abuse i realize i was difficult for her to handle growing up i take accountability for who i used to be especially because i am no longer that person but she refused to ever take accountability for the damage she caused me i dont regret going no contact my mental health is still struggling as i heal all the traumas in my life but at the same time i feel like a giant burden has been lifted
im alright nothing bad happened when i went to lunch with my pop pop my stuff is safe
pop pop always wants me dressed up and have my hair combed even if where not going somewhere fancy
i had to move back home due to a breakdown my father became very cold during this period now im over it in trying to build our relationship back up however i practically had to beg for him to even talk to me he is now but our relationship is sort of an ultimatum unless i talk to him first he wont talk to me unless i sort of pander to him he wont talk he has disrespectful presence around me he zaps all my power and i have none before we both had a healthy relationship both of us were powerful but now its like he holds complete power over me it affects my thinking my decision making and my mental health and self esteem what do i do im moving back out in a month but my mental health will remain the same
when i was a kid maybe like ish years old my dad was the cool fun etc kind of parent the corporal punishment pretty common where we live started around this age and from there everything started going downhill for the first few years it was pretty normal but when i was he started having really random spells of anger where it felt like all his sympathy just switched off and hed just go crazy and take it all out on me but then the anger spell would be over and a few hours later it would be like everything was normal again hed go up to months without anything happening and then one day he would just snap when i was covid came and essentially screwed up my life all the month periods of lockdown just made my life a living hell hed refuse to give me food lock me up force me to kneel in the corner of his study for hours on end just so i wouldnt disturb him and the anger spells got a lot more frequent it was kind of up and down from then on where thered be periods where nothing would really happen and periods where day after day he was beating me up excusing it as punishment with belts canes and that sort of thing there was this particular incident when i was where i walked in on him drinking and his breath smelled of alcohol and the first thing he did was invite me to join him five seconds later he was in some wild drunken rage throwing the bottle at me and slamming me against the wall cutting my back with the glass and pouring the fucking alcohol over the open wounds but there were also times where it felt like everything was fine now its sort of in this constant up and down where it feels like there are two entirely different sides of him he doesnt even need me to piss him off or something somedays he just barges into my room and fucking glares at me until i follow him to the study because he fucking knows im too afraid of him to do anything else and it just feels like he can be so horribly sadistic and disgusting at times but others hes so supportive of me and im just praying that whatever is going on in his head is something that can be fixed or changed in some way because i just want the old him back and its so hard to hate the abusive side of him because hes also attached to someone i love more than anyone in the world and someone who has been there from me and im just so lost
hello everyone im reaching out because im feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to handle my current situation at home im about to turn tomorrow but instead of feeling excited i find myself dreading it because of the turmoil in my household to give you some context my mother and stepfather have been arguing almost every day and its not just simple disagreementsit often spirals into verbal and even physical abuse my stepfather has been violent towards me my younger siblings and my mother which has left all of us feeling frightened and unsafe in our own home its heartbreaking to witness and even worse to experience firsthand whats truly distressing is the way my mom handles these situations she tends to bring up past grievances and hurts during their fights using them as weapons against each other she also downplays my stepfathers behavior and expects me to forgive him easily because she believes she had a tougher childhood than i do its like shes invalidating our pain and trauma and its incredibly hurtful but it doesnt end there when my mom is angry she tends to take it out on me and my siblings cursing and degrading us in the heat of the moment its emotionally draining and demoralizing especially when i try to assert myself and speak up for whats right only to be dismissed as immature and told to grow up even more its a constant cycle of blame and invalidation that leaves me feeling lost and trapped to make matters worse my parents have been married for almost eight years now and their constant fighting is taking a toll on all of us the tension in our home is palpable and its affecting our mental and emotional wellbeing today my mom even told me she wont be able to celebrate my birthday because of our disagreements which just adds to the sense of hopelessness and despair im reaching out to seek advice on how to navigate this incredibly challenging situation i feel like im at a loss and dont know where to turn any guidance or support would be greatly appreciated thank you for taking the time to listen
im positive screwed i called someone who saw abuse but didnt stop it i have to meet up with my pop pop today for lunch and soon as he hears what i did background i was camping and i wanted to walk around at night and see what the campground looked like at night in different places but she didnt let me i knew that campground though and i know how to be careful my nice aunt was there and she did hold my arms behind me and my ex aunt was there too i remember what happened and what she called me a stupid spoiled little brat after years of having to hide this yesterday i called her out and told her i just want an apology just once she denied it and said it never happened unlike before this was a good thing
i just had the worst day in a long time which is crazy because yesterday i fainted during public speaking my mom bought me these starbucks coffee cans a few days ago but shes one of those people on tik tok that always listen to the videos they hear well shes convinced that it is an energy drink and maybe it is but today when i started drinking it infront of her she starts telling me how bad that is for me i respectfully say but its just starbucks and she still was giving me a lecture on how its not healthy i decided to walk away which she did not appreciate and started talking to my aunt about how i need to get mad and unmad this is where i made a mistake i got irritated because i wasnt mad at her i had walked away to protect my peace anyways i try to tell her no im not mad i just get frustrated when you tell me how everything i do is wrong she constantly makes comments about the stuff i do last time she said i had frontal lobe damadge for vaping and shamed me realistically all i wanted was to make her understand why i walked away but she started yelling at me and cutting me off i go into her room shes yelling at me to get out and i just wanted to finish my point well she starts screaming so bad and i freeze and she comes at me and physically pushed me out of her room and slammed the door on me i got very angry and hurt and i started crying and screamed i hate you you are a narcissist that is where i know i messed up as thats pretty rude but she litterally is more concerned that i called her a narcissist over me hating her now she is so worried that my aunt is going to talk shit and call her abusive as she has witnessed this whole thing and now shes shit talking me to my dad saying its my fault they are going to think this of her i try so hard to talk to her but she keeps twisting the story and im starting to feel crazy i just want to know if i am in the wrong so im being as transparent as possible
my m mom really a stepmom but shes been in my life since i was so shes always been mom severely abused me as far back as i can remember it was just much about being hit as it was being psychologically messed with some of the earlier memories were of being sent to my room and i would have to remove my clothing and be told not to get into the clothes or id get whooped i would sit on my top bunk feeling real strange exposed confused but it was often enough that i knew it to be normal i was given smacks on my private area a few times that i remember when i got older went through puberty and got much bigger than her she seemed to really make a point of letting me know im not in charge and that i wont shame her by being an animal so anytime i was being yelled at i had to get on my knees and pull my pants down she would say it was a reality check she had a focus on me not being an animal and called my penis my tail if i was being talked to or spanked and it moved to much shed chastise me for wagging it spankings were front and back nothing off limits and i was not to hide or pull away or worse would be threatened she had a way of really making me believe she needed to do what she was doing and it was normal i would be forced to kneel outward either in my room her room or the back deck with no pants or underwear it would last forever it felt like and i was not to move this is part of the really disgusting and messed up part when i was like that i was told she would force my obedience no matter what i was not to move an inch or flinch she would let her dogs come sniff me and lick me and tell me that if i was cleaner it wouldnt happen this isnt true i tried i would be stuck there and she would pretend not to notice but sure did as soon as i moved she eventually got real open with this level of humiliation and knew i would never share what happened as i was deeply shamed she would openly talk about me getting my tail licked and insinuated it would come out if i stepped over the line this is such a small amount of the details im just starting to open up
i am turning in may i escaped my abusive household back in july i went away to work in a different city so i could be apart from them for months and when it was over i moved out immediately and got my own place in september in my hometown i have been working since i was started back in july so i saved up money to do so the first two weeks were really hard and i was mourning the family i never had the one i was supposed to have i cried a lot because i knew i deserved a lot better and i didnt get treated like i was supposed to i kinda put all my energy into working picking up all the extra shifts i was allowed so i didnt have to be alone and that way i didnt have much time to feel sorry for myself christmas was a really difficult time since the place i work at was closed for days and even my two flatmates went home to their families to celebrate holidays are so difficult to spend alone and now that easter is coming up those feelings are coming out again and i just feel so lonely obviously it is still much better than having to be at home and i am so grateful that i can be apart from them but its still very difficult i picked up extra shifts for easter too but since i cant work days a week i have to be home too by myself my question to you guys who have went through this too would be how you cope with this feeling that you are supposed to be together with your loved ones but arent does it get better with time it would be easier if i had a partner but sadly i dont so spending it with them isnt an option either i struggle a lot with my image of a family i crave the feeling of being close to them but the idea of a mother and motherly love disgusts me and i couldnt stand being loved by one at this point i just wish i could go back in time and put with another family at birth so i would have a whole different image i want to have a mother figure but at the same time it would make me feel so disgusted i just cant i wish everyone in the same position as me all the love and luck because you all deserve it and to those still at home trying to escape all the strength it is a very difficult thing to do but being lonely alone is still better than being there have a happy easter you all
my mother and i always fight the past five or six times shes pushed me beyond my breaking point to the end that ive always selfinflicted hitting myself in the head because i didnt want to hit her getting so infuriated i would bite myself on the arm this last time a couple days ago when i went to get my selfinflicted bite looked at it was fine by the way the doc at the er told me i needed to quit selfinflicting and redirect in some other way well today about ten minutes ago instead of selfinflicting or redirectingi just went for it i charged her apparently i hurt my ankle in the process i must have stepped wrong what i was far too infuriated at her to pay attention to my footing anyway i went to punch her in the head but she put her arm up to defend herself so i grabbed it by the wrist and yanked it downward so id have a free shot i stopped short though and faked her out a couple times threatening to hit her all the while i was gripping the zhit out of her wrist as i held it out of the way ive got vice grip hands my grip strength is stronger than most peoples she was on the verge of tears so i decided to let her go and so i faked to punch her a couple more times just to make sure she got the message i was still blocking her way out of the room so then she said are you gonna let me go or are you gonna go and so i stepped aside and like shooing a stray dog i snappedly pointed for her to go on get so im icing my sore footankle right now when thats done im gonna go to one of those minor emergency places to make sure i didnt tear any ligaments or anything but i finally stood up to the old fat cow i didnt selfinflict i just went for it i feel proud myself god it felt good felt powerful finally to be able to have control back
some backstory i live with my mom who divorced my dad for being abusive i have always hated him for it but my mom always forced me and my sister to spend weeksmonths with her as he was abusive and she just wanted him to buy stuff for us he is really religious and extremly sexist so he has always treated me better than my sister recently he found out my sister smokes and takes nicotine which he asked me about and i told him the truth i regret it i fear that he will ask her about and it will be big mess he has almost hit my sister but i pushed him down i hate my dad and his new family he has to always makes comment how i look and tell me i am ugly how i am i just want to tell my sister i hope she doesnt get mad i will update but i will just not visit my dad anymore the reason why this happened is because my dad is too lazy to text and i told him i only wanted to text him for contact as i can get the word properly without feeling bad or feeling my words not coming out i just can express myself better over text as i dont feel physcialy pressured or the fear they will scream over me please someone give me feedback update my sister is okay and she knew something fishy was happening we figured out he was going through her stuff and we both are now not going to have any contact with him for a while

remember how could i not me dont be afraid to talk to me about anything good or bad friend i wont friend i promise friend you fish me nah i think im more of a fish stick xb i am very worried for her i have had lots of suicidal situations in my life a few years ago i was constantly having suicidal thoughts and recently my uncle has cut his wrists i really dont want her to feel like that i understand what it is like to have abusive parents my dad and stepmom are not the best i have also had experience with her mom we used to live together as roommates and her mom would constantly be a jerk to me my mom would often take me and my friend places to avoid staying home alone with her mom i am also planning on telling my friends dad if she doesnt tell her herself but at the same time i dont want to get involved any suggestions btw the fish and fish stick thing is just am inside joke of ours
this is my first time posting here so please let me know if this is the right place or not to be posting this recently i f have started noticing that the way im being treated by my mother as well as how i have been treated in the past could qualify as sexual abuse but since ive tried to bury my experiences that are still currently going on as a way to cope with it i dont know if this really is sexual abuse or not i also want to clarify that i do know that my mother is physically emotionaly and mentally abusive but i just need to know if this is sexual abuse as well for some context my mother is extremely violent and would randomly lash out at me for no reason she does this by either physically attacking me or hurling verbal abuses at me but now im noticing that whenever she attacks me she only kicks me at my vagina shell look at it and then shell just kick me right there with full force i know that shes aiming for my vagina because she keeps on trying to repeatedly hit me there also she just randomly attacks me there without any sort of provocation and if i bring up how thats extremely inappropriate and try to communicate my feelings she tells me that i have a dirty mind for thinking that way about her she makes jokes about random people exploring me sexually for example one time my neighbour was having a bunch of construction workers building his house and i told my mom how i wished that this would be over soon i said that because i always listen to music while showering and the sound of construction prevents absolutely anything else from being audible when i explained this to her she started saying that i have no reason to complain and am i saying that because i want one of the workers to join me in the shower shes always touching me innapropreatly one day when i was i was getting dressed in the bathroom after my shower when she just started banging on the door she threatened to break the door if i didnt open it so i slightly open it and ask her what does she want this was when she just forcefully opened the door and barged mind you i was completely naked down to my butt when i tried to tell her to leave and cover myself she told me to stop overreacting because shes my mom and according to her that means that she can see me naked she did this just to come inside and measure my waist she accused me of having sex sending nudes being a prostitute masturbating and all sorts of sexual activities that she imagined i could be doing shes beeinga causing me of this for as long as i can remember like one time i was and i overheard her telling my siblings that she doesnt feel safe in leaving me alone at home because i might being doing something innapropreate and nasty she also says that she worries that ill grow up to become a sex worker finally shes always deliberately exposing herself to me and she says that its fine because shes my mother like shell use the bathroom and leave the whole door open or shell just walk out naked in front of me and complain if i look away because according to her its okay if i see her naked as im just her daughter on multiple occasions ive told her just how uncomfortable all of this makes me feel but she never takes it seriously and actively ignores it is this sexual abuse
im really in a dilemma both my parents have drinking problem and my dad have been drinking ever since i could remember we faced a lot of problems cause of his alcoholism but now that hes older his abuse have toned down the problem is my mom have started to drink and shes ruining the family environment it was another thing if she was drinking and just having a good time but whenever she drink she randomly choose a hill to die on and just make everyones life miserable i want to tell my dad about since my dad havent suspect a thing and i just wanna be done it i just want to them get divorced or something and if i tell my dad about her drinking they probably will separate as all her behaviours will be explained should i tell my dad that my mom been drinking that is why every night its war for us all
im glad he said it at least we dont have to pretend now ive never posted anything about my dad before of the memories i f have of my dad are bad ones he is verbally and physical abusive fake and has tried his best to make his wife and kids dependent on him he has somewhat succeeded at the last one yesterday my dad and i had a disagreement and he started yelling all i had to do was ask why are you yelling and he lost his shit bc apparently i had disrespected him and then i lost my shit i was so tired of it i normally just ignore his yelling because i dont like to stoop down to his level i didnt yell back at him but i was saying things like do you think you yelling is helping at all right now and he was blaming my mom for everything he wasnt even talking straight to me he never has this morning i woke up to him and my mom yelling after he came back from his night shift he blames her for not disciplining me for a good amount of time a few years actually i thought him acting this way was somehow my fault that i did something wrong to hurt him i thought i was at fault for not turning out like he wanted im out of that now i know that no matter how i turned out he would never be happy because in every possibility i see myself standing up to his abuse and he cant stand it i have to live with him for some more time unfortunately but at least now i know how he actually feels im the type of person to never be in debt as soon as i started earning money i took responsibility of my own expenses and even helped out in groceries i dont give a shit anymore im going to use his money he gave me his card as a nice gesture because he couldnt give me his time or love he always talks about how hes gotten me everything ive ever wanted which is not true but if thats what hes claiming so be it im saving my money for when i actually need it ive always respected his time and space because he works night shifts by choice but hes never done the same for me so i dont really care anymore im gonna do what i want im only gonna deal with him because of my siblings and mom i love them and i love my friends my dad can fall off a cliff for all i care
hello im just here to vent more about my situation with my nigerian parents with me being a m i did a previous post in rnarcissisticparents regarding this but something happened again recently they found out about my grades being poor to them my grades being poor is because of me playing mens volleyball to which they both hate as a sport as a result they then proceeded to yell at me about how im not serious throw objects at me and search my tabs to which they found me watching youtube videos instead of doing work despite it being friday they proceeded to tell me how volleyball is a useless sport and how i wont get paired in it but if i wanted to pursue a career in basketball it would be fine due to the money despite me knowing well that i wouldnt even make it to the league they also said that if i dont pass in college that theyll either disown me get a hatchet and cut me to pieces for the world to see threatened to smash my chromebook on my head if i ever try to play volleyball again and other cruel stuff too whats funny too is that when they were searching my tabs they first found the youtube video it was an scp foundation one and the next two tabs were volleyball related shows that i was watching those shows being haikyuu and spike team the haikyuu and spike team tabs werent loading but they skipped the haikyuu one then waited for the spike team one to load despite them not doing the same for the haikyuu one and then afterwards they proceeded to yell at me more and thrown my objects my father throwing a pen and nearly throwing a shoe although i was able to get back into my room and lock it again afterwards they proceeded to say how i wasnt serious how i had to pass and how if i dont pass then id be a disgrace after this they proceeded to go through colleges with my mother trying to make me do something easier like biology chemistry or biochemistry but my father wasnt having it saying how ill learn the same things from pharmacy or premedicine if i do biochemistry and id be a bum in the streets if i do biology or chemistry instead of pharmacy or premedicine then once again threatening me with violence if i fail college despite me being in my senior year of highschool then after all this they then proceeded to schedule me to do a tour to mcphs one of the schools that my parents forced me to apply too during spring break saying how its his school despite my mother asking me what school i want to go to but i didnt even choose since i knew that my father and her wouldnt like any of my options and would try to shift me into theirs at this rate i wasnt even as scared as i was last time just more annoyed if anything i have to put up with their pressure and how they want doctors and such i still feel trapped like last time and i feel like no matter what i do im basically forced in one direction in life by some sort of god or something that being medicine despite me my counselor and my health and wellness teacher knowing very well that i dont like medicine i didnt even try the suggestion my counselor made about having my parents come to her and talk about my college choices since i knew this would make my situation worst i even made a promise to my coach that id be playing this year again last year inorder to have college coaches come and watch me play to be recruited but i guess thats never happening i dont really know what to do at the rate my life is going tbh and its like im expecting to get better but at the same time i knew damn well that its never going to i also made another post regarding this couple of months ago ill link it below here edit also my father talked to me about it which was basically a lot of nothing where he was saying how he hates failure figures and how i wasnt speaking up despite me knowing thats a clear trap for anything nonmedicineschool wise how i couldve asked for help on anything despite me knowing thats a lie that help will only apply for medicine and that i probably wouldve had to deal with more abuse if i did told him my problems saying how they sent me to private school for better opportunities despite me knowing that im only in private school because i snitched on them on my elementary school counselor for the public school i was at about their abuse and they only moved me to private school inorder for them to avoid cps i still have them occasionally ask if i told anyone about what their doing to this day after school and other useless tidbits too my father also wants me to stop watching animated shows and watch live action showssports despite me watching mens volleyball games people like erik shoji reviewing professional games and watching the out of system volleyball podcast but knowing my parents watching any irl volleyball content doesnt count because he thinks that watching animated shows will slow my mental capacities and such calling it shit and useless in all honesty i have no clue what to do
me f my mother f and my little brother m have been subjects to my fathers m verbal emotional and physical abuse since i can remember he is a very argumentative and abusive alcoholic who starts arguments and lectures over the smallest things he constantly verbally abuses us and hits us just in the right places where no one would see and im reaching my breaking point we have tried to leave him before but my mother was not financially stable enough to support us and we had to go back to him due to us being from eastern europe toxic and abusive relationships and partners are common to my mother and we just have been enduring his abuse ever since i want to emphasise my mother is the strongest and kindest person i have ever met she always protected me when i was young and would bare his punches and slaps for me now we both do everything we can to shield my little brother from him i dont have much proof of the abuse if thats needed for a case against him im not sure but i have countless stories of his threats to take our lives to do horrible things to my mother infront of us and many other horrifying things we currently live in the uk and i want to take the initiative to finally be rid of him but i dont know how i have spoken about this with my friends who have been through similar situations and they say the police wont do much to help is this true i just really cannot live like this anymore any advice or help is appreciated
when i f was years old my then year old half brother began abusing me the abuse occured dailynightly breaking into the bathroom to harm me in the shower in my own bed and luring me into his bedroom there was a specific incident when i was that he attacked me in the shower this resulted in a panic attack and me naked on the bedroom floor my father walked in on me panicking and watched my brother exit the bathroom and asked no questions my parents are both alcoholics and would often leave us alone to go drink when i was finally i was berated into telling my mother why i was harming myself which resulted in her throwing a selfpity party and no therapy for anyone nothing was ever done eventually i was told i would be moving states away to live with my grandmother and everything was swept under the rug my mother continues to financially and emotionally support my rapist brother no jail time no record no therapy he has been protected from facing any reality or consequences of his actions i just dont understand how a parent could blatantly choose one child over another especially the offender i feel like im going crazy all these years later and as much as i try to keep my mother and brother out of my life they are in the same small town as i am

sorry in advance i had to add alot of extra information for context im sorry this is so long im just looking for help i f cut my dad off in august the day before school after he had a huge explosive episode where he texted me telling me to just stay with my mom from now on i saw him on the weekends for years my dad complained i never saw him enough and this summer i was seeing him the most i ever had in my life days a week thinking it would help our relationship he became the most emotionally abusive he had ever been with me and would even get mad at me for asking to stop and buy medicine when sick because it put him at an inconvenience where he would yell at me calling me insensitive and selfish things like that for more context my father is and lives with my grandparents where he doesnt pay any bills like food water or electric no rent either and only spends his money on his truck motorcycle and weed he has always been narcissistic and ive always been a vessel for his emotional abuse he is also emotionally abusive to my sweet grandmotherhis mom and openly shames her and insults her back to my main story since august communication has been off with my dad he doesnt text regularly or check in he was essentially just abandoned me at the drop of a hat because he was mad he has only seen me on holidays and only contacts me relating to holidays or if he wants something from me but during the whole duration of time i havent been seeing him and months before he hasnt been paying any child support so hes a little below in debt to my mom this is where shit gets messy my birthday is coming up very soon and my dad has been contacting me about trying to see me for my birthday which sounds considerate at first he has called me twice between christmas and now to talk to me about it since my th birthday is next month but both times he has called me he has been bragging about the money he has been spending on his toyota tacoma which is obviously expensive he has bragged about spending on it the last time i called him so while contacting me for my birthday he has been bragging about the money he would rather spend on his truck than me while simultaneously posting his road trip vacations with his girlfriend which are also very expensive its clear he is only contacting me when its convenient for him but if i tell him i dont wanna see him for my birthday for obvious reasons he will totally explode on me the easy summary being i hardly see my dad because he doesnt contact me when he does he brags about himself and the money he would rather spend on a truck than me and then fucks off until its convenient for him to see me again i dont know how to stand up to him because hes so incredibly manipulative i feel the only way it will happen is if i just blow up on him because he doesnt communicate but i wish i knew what to do he will most likely wanna see me for easter and push me more and more to see me for my birthday when i dont want to does anyone have any advice

i have an abusive father that ive completely cut contact with for a few years now im planning on getting married to my partner in the next few years but it just occurred to me that i have no idea whos gonna walk me down the aisle so my question is basically the title
ever since i was a child i remember my father yelling at others because he spilled ketchup he also did not let me go to my grandparents house because of this and hit me or because my mom talked to a male employee for too long he shattered one of our house doors with how hard he closed them after mom said she was just asking the employee to order some vegetables for her job as a cook but in the last two years i feel like its becoming worse and everytime he starts yelling i fear he will do something to us the most recent one happened min ago was because i opened a nutella jar when he already opened one last night and told no one he smashed both of the jars threw them in the trash then started throwing posted silverware glasses just anything into the washing machine and yelled at me how i am such a bitch i also recall that he once broke our front door glass and it was my fault because i was taking a bath and did not open the door for him he also yelled at me and my mother on my birthday just because he had a bad day and my mother did not clean up flowers when she was after an operation he usually yells at us after work but he doesnt go that much anymore so i just want to know what i should do because anytime i tell my friends they just ignore my troubles and change the theme into something completely different

edit ive seen a few people talk about my mom saying if she doesnt step up shes part of the problem my mom does step up she defends me a lot of times but shes just a person too and ive seen my dad make her cry multiple times shes my main supporter she fights for me and im not sure i would be here without her while i truly appreciate the concern please dont call her part of the problem if someone doesnt deserve it its her the needed context is i have pcos which makes it impossible for me to wax my legs because my hair is really thick and it makes it hurt like hell i am not allowed to shave using a razor for reasons unknown to me i am female turning in a month i am cm about ft tall and weigh kg i am not unhealthy physically apart from dry skin xb i was getting changed and i realised i forgot my pyjama pants so i figured id head to the kitchen to throw away some trash and then go grab them i had a shirt on and obviously underwear which means only my legs were visible as i walked into the kitchen i heard my father make a weird noise and say thats disgusting and you look disgusting if you want to make yourself look like that i shouldnt be forced to see you i dont want to look at ugly things and this is just disgusting do this again and youre grounded xb he then started telling my mom how ugly and horrible i look and how much i disgust him i usually dont take his comments personally because i know hes abusive and my therapist told me not to listen to him but this one really hit me because ive struggled all my life with finding people who liked me and even now that i have friends i am nobodys first choice im always the friend they hang out with when their boyfriends are busy as for me i have never been in a relationship with someone not online i am lonely and my father saying how disgusting i am makes me think that maybe the reason why i cant get a boyfriend isnt that im autistic isnt that i have anxiety maybe its just that im a disgusting person maybe i truly have a disgusting body xb i dont know it usually doesnt bother me but this time it did i used to be overweight kg at about cm ft and i lost kg by going to the gym and changing my diet and i now feel comfortable in my body but maybe i dont look good enough yet he says im dirty disgusting smelly and that i look homeless i dont even know what the point of this post is venting i guess i needed to tell someone and be listened to and hopefully get some replies i dont know thank you for listening
so my step dad has been tickling my thigh ill try and explain it as best as i can so he has been putting his hand on my thigh and squeezes it over and over in a short period of time and apparently its tickling although he hasnt done it in a while i still feel uncomfortable my mom and mimi grandma says that in their younger days that my great grandfather mimis dad and moms granddad did the same thing to them i do know that my mimi has done the same thing to me but i dont feel uncomfortable when she did it but i was like or when she did that is what my step dad did was sexual harassment
i just cant handle this anymore i am uncomfortable with living in this house with my parents especially my dad english isnt my first language so please understand if i make any mistakes you dont need to read the whole thing i just want to interact with some people who will understand me so ill appreciate it if u leave comments for me if you go to the end of this paragraph there is a sumary so u can read that one instead too btw im f from to i was in college and i could live alonemy parents paid all the fees including my uni and rent i worked as a tutor for a while tho and escape from my parents not always tho cuz when i didnt get their callhad a boyfriend they used to just storm into my room and yell at me they had gps tracking app on my phone too which i found out later and deleted i wasnt very happy in university too i want to find a job which allows me to work from home or requires less social interaction but my parents strongly wanted me to become a teacher so i had to choose elementary education major im very introverted and anxious so it was pretty hard for me i loved interacting with kids tho when i was preparing for the exam last year to be an certificated teacher my anxietydepression hit the peak and i did several self harm and suicide attempts and one of them was jumping off a building it was mostly from the pressure my parents gave me i broke my spineright ankle had to go through surgeries and almost went completely numb in my legs since i hurt my spine some part of my right thigh is still numb though it was months ago and i had to move back with my parents i can walk now but im not allowed go out alone at all since im still healing but they bring me to every family event even though i dont want to since im tiredhurting ive been getting therapy from my college for the last years and now im doing it online also taking meds for my depression i try my best to get better but as long as i live with my parents i dont think i can ever get better there are some things that i still cant forgetforgive that my mom and dad did to me my dad is very impulsive person he cheated on my mom with a hooker once and when my mom found out he started crying blaming my mom for everything and tried to stab himself in the stomach in front of me and my younger siblings and he used to get mad at work and then put that anger on me and my siblings especially me verbally and physically there was one time he beat the shit out of me and strangled me when i was in high school i had bruises on my face in my eye also on my body my mom gave me a makeup concealer and told me to cover the bruises and go to school he said sorry but when he said sorry he said its partly bcz of me too for getting him mad my aunt which was at the time my high school counselor brought me to the counseling room and told me it is my fault for getting dad mad also when i was in high school i was groomed by an adult man and when he rped me i confessed it to my parents and they called me a whore and got mad at me later when they were calmed down they did their best to help me but i still cant forgive them and when my homeroom teacher told my mom i cant get in the university that my mom wants me to go she got so mad at me and telling me how disappointed she is at me and if i wasnt out with a guy getting groomed i couldve gotten a better grade i took every pills i could find in my house and slept hoping that i dont wake up the next morning but i ended up waking up vomiting and when my parents found out they called me pathetic and even though my uncle said they need to take me to the hospital they told him to leave me alone in the bathroom until i finish vomiting so they rly did leave me alone and even though all these were hard enough the one worst thing that i cant forgive is that when i was severely bullied in elementary school my mom didnt care and even told me that i dont need to care if i get better grades than them and my dad told me im a loser for not beating them back even my teacher didnt care none of them and they didnt help me for years until the kids stopped bullying me since i got so depressed and basically let them just do whatever they do to me and they lost interest and now suddenly they want to interact with me when i needed it they werent even there or they made it worse i dont even want to talk to them i just do my bare minimum like telling them good morning or good night they are trying to make it up for all those years that they neglected me and the thing is i am mad at them but also i feel guilt for feeling mad cuz theyre finally trying to make it up for me my dad still is a very impulsive person and he gets mad at me when its not my fault i feel suicidal everyday i just want to escape and what hurts me the most is even though they know im going through a hard time they wont change they wont change their controlling behavior and telling me im useless when i was hospitalized i was crying everyday and my mom told me i ended up like this cuz im spoiled that they gave me everything i wanted and i still ended up like this when i had an argument with my dad recently he said he doesnt remember beating me at allit happened almost everyday in my childhood and he always did his best to raise me everytime i think about this i feel like im losing my shit i feel shitty everyday i dont even know if theyre really trying to help me get better staying in my room all day is making this worse but they wont let me out at all unless im with them they told me im fat everyday cuz i gained some weight after taking depression meds and i couldnt exercise at all for months i used chat gpt to summarize this living in this house with my parents especially my dad has become unbearable for me throughout my college years i had moments of escape when i lived alone but even then my parents overbearing behavior followed me their constant calls intrusive tracking apps and unpredictable reactions made me feel suffocated university wasnt much better i wanted a career that suited my introverted nature but my parents insisted on me becoming a teacher the pressure reached its peak during exam preparations leading to severe selfharm and multiple suicide attempts the injuries i sustained forced me to move back in with my parents despite therapy and medication i still carry deep wounds from my parents actions my fathers impulsive behavior and past violence combined with my mothers neglect and hurtful words continue to haunt me their attempts at reconciliation feel insincere overshadowed by years of neglect and abuse even now they refuse to acknowledge their role in my suffering or make meaningful changes their controlling behavior and hurtful comments worsen my mental state trapped in my room i yearn for escape but they wont let me out unless theyre with me their constant criticism especially about my weight adds to my distress every day is a struggle against suicidal thoughts i feel lost unsure if they genuinely want to help me get better or if theyre simply trying to alleviate their guilt the pain of their past actions weighs heavily on me leaving me feeling trapped and hopeless
hi im a yr old college student who is finishing up my freshmen year my mother shows clear sign of narcissistic personality disorder and has abused me and my siblings for years after going to college i had high hopes our relationship would improve as i would have more freedom and been viewed as an adult or even just a mature person however that has not been the case and even with the physical distance between us the abuse has gotten worse i am working towards saving up to move out after i graduate college and trying to get counseling through my school however im not in a position to go no contact with my mother for a multitude of reasons ive made the mistake of repeatedly calling out my narcissistic mother on her behavior this of course only enrages a narcissist my mother has used this to gaslight me and call me crazy and emotional i am looking for advice on how to sort of swallow my pride and how to keep cool when an abuser tries to upset you ive tried the gray rock method however this lack of engagement also upsets my mother more i cant bring myself to pretend my mother is a saint so pretending everything is fine and kissing ass doesnt work for me its also not going to be very believable any solutions to keeping your dignity while trying to deal with a narcissist
i started cutting today after an argument with my mom i want to die so she can feel some kind of pain behind me she is so stupid she forgets im the one she sent to school with bruises and cuts she called me a slut at and she told me she would kill me leading to my first attempt at she wished rape and sa on me for years but im the one who cant take accountability
itit feels likehow do i even put it my parents did some things to my siblings and i and if they were ever found out they would probably be locked away for child abuse but now its only verbalrarely and nobody seems to believe me or care example my father who of the time now is funny and caring and nice to be around beat and whipped me till i bled and then threwphysically threw meme into a dark room for six hours threatening to throw away the key while i screamed bloody murder begging to be let out nonstop and that i was sorry i was around six or seven example i made something for my parents and wanted to show them i tripped and knocked over a vase destroying both my gift and the vase the shards stabbed into my skin but i dare not scream or cry i tried to glue if back together and was successful but they later found out and beat me so hard i collapsed onto the ground almost unable to move i was nine example it was my eleventh birthday my older sister was in a boarding school and it just so happened to be visiting day i was so excited to see her i didnt mind sharing my birthday they completely forgot i existed but i didnt care i was happily munching away on a snack when my parents commented on my weight and appearance saying i looked disgusting and that i shouldnt eat so much i stayed in the car until we left they then grounded me for causing a scene i didnt say anything just left example my brother is a gifted person he went to highschool from around the age of eight he was my parents prized possession though they only ever cared when they could flex with him he once did bad on a test because of stress my dad locked him and my brother in his room beat him until his face would end up with permanent scars but he wasnt done he took him with him and around an hour later came back without him my mother begged and pleaded and took one of the other cars to go look for him she found him on a random street stripped down to his boxers bleeding he was example i grew up thinking i was a monster my mom would scream about how horrible i was and how i ruined her life and how i was nothing but a demonspawn my parents would say that they would sooner strangle me to death that let me drive them insane i thought they were right that i was a horrific demon because why else would this happen to me i was nicknameduseless child by them and would be blamed for everything only around percent i was even vaguely related to including just being there when something bad happened the twist one day they just stopped aside from verbal nothing i grew up feeling fear for my life just for it tostop i found out they essentially thought i was too old for it to be accepted anymore and the same thing happened to my siblings but my siblings defended them saying it was a cultural thing butbut thats not fair im supposed to justdeal with it im supposed to accept that i was the problem because my parents were perfect angels nobody would believe me if i tried to say anything and i just gave up because now all the physical violence stopped so ive lost my proof my siblings either side with them or are going no contact with me and my parents the second they can and just dont want any problems until then so why me why am i the one at the butt end of the stick the one who was despised since birth the curse i was no angel but i tried to be and was most of the time so why does it feel like my trauma doesnt exist when i still have this pain in my chest why dont i get to sweep my problems under the rug
im f with adhd and autism when i was younger i went to a really bad school and my parents were a lot worse then i have ptsd from a lot of different situations and my parents wont accept it about months ago i left a residential hospital that my parents sent me to now that im back they keep talking about a contract where if i break down or cry ill get punished my parents wont let me be a fucking teenager i wasnt able to get a childhood and now i cant get a teenagehood either they dissmimiss everything and wont accept that the residential made it worse
tw possible sa as the title says i posted about my mother saying no one wanted me at a birthday party because i wasnt a popularwell after reading so many comments i started to realize and remember a lot about my mother for a long time that memory was the main one i could remember about her but ive started breaking down remembering some of the worse stuff shes done and the idea there could be worse i dont remember or cant i made a list because i think it can help me to remember for a long time i just thought i didnt have a good memory but i just didnt want to i remember being a kid and she kept having me pee in cups i asked my dad a few days ago if i had dr issues or something and he said he was always the one to take me to the dr if i needed because his job gave him better pay leave after i told my dad this memory he got a horrible sick look apparently my mom had joked to him when i was that she could make extra money by selling my pee one memory that makes me sick is when she used to fill up the bath tub and hold me for hours crying saying im going to save you from this world i think she was planning on drowning me when i was young she used to say i was the reincarnated jesus and she believed i could walk on water if i tried hard enough she stole my nintendo ds i managed to save up for and pawned it i looked for that thing for years and every time i asked her about it she would say maybe you should clean your room and you might find it one memory that sickness me is when she drove me to a motel she and some stranger had sx in the room with me on the couch in the room after my mom fell asleep the man came over and sat on the couch with me still fully naked i dont remember anything other than when we left the motel my mom was crying i asked my dad if he knew and he said he knew she was cheating but didnt know she always took me with her i have snipits of other memories pop up of other motels and men but this one is the most vivid the mans name was doc he lived around north texas she used to have my sister and i physically fight each other for her entertainment just like gladiator combat my sister had my fingernails still in her arms when we were at my mothers funeral i feel so guilty for how i treated her i was younger than her and i saw her as the enemy for years my mother used to have me ask her for water and if i annoyed her she would deny my request i still have issues with remembering to drink water my teacher told her she thought i had adhd my mom responded by taking me home and locking me in a dark closet for a few hours she let me out before my dad came home my mom made it clear i wasnt to tell anyone anything about her i wasnt taught to wash myself or brush my hair i dont know how teachers didnt call cps i smelled and looked awful i also wore the same clothes to school almost daily the one case where cps was called when the school nurse thought i wasnt being brought to the dr i told the case worker i was scared of what my mom would do to me because of her coming to my house she told my mom she knew this case wasnt serious and she wasnt going to really investigate my house growing up looked like one from the show horders i had to waide through garbage laundry and organic waste up to my waist to get out the door after cps was called she pulled me out of school and into k or as i think of it the worst two years of my life she had me take care of her cleaning and cooking she also had me give her insulin and would smack me if it hurt her when i lost my first tooth she made me she had grabbed me by the hair for the whole moviewatch this horror movie about some demon tooth fairy who kills kids for their teeth but cant go in the light i dont know the name of the movie i slept with the lights on for years when the light bulb burned out i sobbed and had to figure out for myself how to change it or live in the dark i was too short to reach the bulb i realize after all this she was a sadistic sociopathic woman yet i loved her more than life
i dont know what to do or to feel is it alright that my mother hurts me after saying something disrespectful to her she always kicks punches pinches me and always aims for my face or the back of my head she said that she only act this way to teach me a lesson because im always quote disrespecting her im the only one one she does this to she doesnt hurt any of my other siblings earlier we were sitting on the couch watching a movie and she gets up to put a timer on our air conditioner and accidentally turns it off it mad me chuckle a bit so once she was done putting a timer on it i joked about it to her ooh you broke the ac i said it in a joking tone and laughed a bit then she answered me with just shut the fuck up will you and of course i was a bit put off by that so i answered her geez kill joy much then she pinched my wrist for some reason of course i said ow because it was pretty painful bit i didnt do anything else but playfully nudge her hand with my elbow then she pinched my arm and said why did you elbow me to which i responded because you punched me at this point i still saw it as a bit of a joke and that me and my mother were just play fighting but i guess to her it didnt seem that way soon enough i turned away from her then out of nowhere she hit the of my head with her palm and i did what was that for and she replied you were being disrespectful even if i picked you you have no right to elbow me i mean i didnt put any force into it but it didnt hurt didnt it so why did you hit me i then said youre being a disrespectful little bitch thats why then i said i would be this way if you didnt keep hurting me maybe if you didnt pinch me i wouldnt have nudged you she replied with go on one more word out of your mouth and ill fucking punch you and i said but i was just joking are you really going to hit me because i joked about our air conditioner what kind of reasoning is that why are you like this i could then sense by then that after that sentence was over that i was done for you never listen huh she said right before she pinched the back of my head and my shoulder hard since followed this with a painful pinch it was like she dug her fingernails in my skin and skinned the part of my body in which she pinched this was all pretty painful even while im writing this i still feel like ive just been punched by her of course after that i stayed quiet i just felt a feeling in my chest something that i feel whenever she beats me up or when im sad like my stomach dropped or something she still kept going and running her mouth about his i was so disrespectful and how much of a bitch i was and i just had enough even though i knew that what i was about to say would make her mad i still said it wont you just stop already youve already hit me you hot what you wanted just be quiet and watch the movie i move an inch or two away from her and squeezed my eyes shut expecting for the worst she didnt say anything after that and just punched my shoulder blade extremely hard youre such a disrespectful cunt i told you to shut up didnt i yet you keep on talking when i tell you that shit hurt it hurt bad it made he just hold my shoulder and mad me shut shut up for good i just couldnt take it anymore and got up to go to my room dont come back down here so god help me if i see you down here later youre going to fucking wish that you didnt go down those stairs i just dont know what to do anymore everytime we get into an argument it ends with her hitting kicking punching or pinching me all i can do is express myself through my words and be so called disrespectful to her because its not like i can hurt her or hit her back shes my mother and i have so much respect for her but sometimes all of this hurt just makes me burst into tears each night i get closer and closer to committing and shes probably going to be the number one reason as to why id kill myself ive always been pretty suicidal every since i was nine years old ive tried and tried opening up to her about the suicidal thoughts that i had been having on multiple different occasions but they all end up with the same out come she either hurts me pushes that fact away or both i told her one time that she shouldnt have had kids if she didnt know how to handle her and her childrens feelings but she just ended up beating me up i dont even know if i can cry about my experiences on here because even though what she does is painful it doesnt leave a scar so should i really be yapping if it wasnt bad enough to leave a scar i dont know is my mother in the wrong or am i just overreacting
i f dont know if im being abused or just sensitive i feel like im being verbally and emotionally abused but idk my dad has always been quick to call me names like bitch cunt asshole brat amongst others and he always refuses to apologise the lack of apology didnt bother me when i was young but as ive gotten older ive realised that i deserve apologies for things that upset me once he called me a bitch and i decided i wouldnt speak to him unless i got an apology i would like to add i dont give anyone else the silent treatment when fighting i just felt as tho this was the best way to get through to him we didnt speak for weeks and it ended in my mother giving out that dad didnt like how he was being treated and i was crying asking what about me and how im being treated i understand i started it but i feel like i was justified and just at my tipping point and also why didnt he speak to me why didnt it bother him that his eldest daughter didnt want to speak to him ive been looking at colleges and at the moment i have my heart set on a college hours away this would mean i would have to live in student accommodation i broke down in front of my mom crying about how me and my dad dont have a relationship now why would we ever have one when i leave with the best intentions she told my dad trying to get him to see how hes pushing us away he reacted by twisting the narrative he claimed i wanted to leave because oh im just such a terrible father just because im not ever talkative i cried for hours after that conversation his love for me and my siblings seems based on how many interests we share with him we have a farm and personally i dont have much interest but i help when i can i find during these times im helping he is much nicer to me and i actually feel like i can talk with him im in a stage of school where my final exams are coming up so im busy studying i also play sports and have a job so i cant farm as often and its always a point of contention i understand he wants help but i feel like roaring that im an ungrateful brat just because i have other priorities is unfair it all came to a head today i left school early yesterday because of a headache and i didnt go in today because of my headache and a cough that has been manifesting over the past few weeks i woke up after a nap to hear him downstairs giving out about me to my mom i actually dont want to repeat it because of how upsetting it was but the basic jist was id never do anything with my life because im missing school for some context i am a good student i always have been i have won national stem awards won debating competitions participated in mun travelled abroad for exchanges and different climate change events fyi these events were mainly paid for by my school i am consistently top of my class in all my subjects and its just shit to hear him disregard all of this because ive missed a few days of school he also accused me of being on drugs i have no idea where this has come from ive never gone near drugs nor given him a reason to believe i have there was a lot more but im just still trying to process it i would just live some advice idk is this just tough love or the way he is or is it actually abuse
my parents make it pretty clear to me they arent abusive but they also tell me that was happens in the house stays in the house and there are some times where i feel like something has to be said so this is what happened today keep in mind i am my parents are full grown adults the story i was going down the stairs and i fell and hurt my hip and since i was a bit tired and exhausted i got a bit worked up i yelled and i opened doors forcefully because i was mad i tell my parents that i am having anxiety about my health and that im feeling burnt out and exhausted and my parents asked what about my health i was anxious about and i said why im constantly getting sick all the time and they pulled the you dont manage it well enough my sinuses and i already knew that but they also know ive done everything i could and nothing has worked i talked to my doctor about that last week and they gave me some new stuff im going to try tonight so anyways after that little emotional blow up of mine and resisting the urge to cry i without knowing slam the closet door shut and my dad says he is gonna come punch me like i punched that door and then after that they bring up the fact that i may or may not need to be dropped off at a mental hospital again like wtf that set me off and here i am now short version in short my dad threatened to punch me and held a fist towards me and threatened to send me back to a mental hospital all because i was having a bit of a meltdown and a rough week
hi sorry but im sick of this and i need advice or something ive been dealing with abusive behavior for years for months my mother has been telling me to get rid of old clothes she kept on telling me she was going to throw out my clothes and even threw out a few without telling me i only found out because i couldnt find them at all in the house still havent found them anywhere she blamed my dog that i recently adopted for the holes but it doesnt look like the dog bitesholes in her clothes or the clothes of mine i sew so i know the difference between a rip or hole made by something sharp like dog teeth i have sewing scissors i keep in my sewing box that i keep out in the open the cuts are not small and ragged like dog teeth holes hes a puppy and a small breed they are whole ass inch long clean cuts with no ripping the dog bites are all over the clothes and the cuts are in areas only like the crotch armpit and chest there are even clean straight cuts on threads that where holding down buttons on one of my old shirts i cant even sew the right buttons on because they are completely missing im running out of clothes this really scares me because when i was she straight up cut the clothes off of me its making me get flash backs to other things too she calls me a fucking psycho when i call her out on her abusive behavior what the fuck do i do i want to leave but i have nothing and i have pets to take care of im scared to leave my pets with her because she might hurt them she used to threaten me to come back because she said she would give away my pets one needs meds everyday and i also have a lizard so i need to spray her terrarium everyday edit i am an adult she still does this shit to me as an grown ass adult
so ive been wanting to post here for a while but couldnt now that ive finally found enough courage to do so i figured out that theres a lot i want to get off my chest it began since i was a child tbh kids make mistakes and i was no different my father never had enough time for me and i completely understand this my mother however wanted me to be a all the time even machines arent efficient how can i be even for my smallest of mistakes i got beaten i had a problem with my stomach when i was a child i used to vomit everything i used to eat and guess what got beaten for wasting food and her effort like that but that was a long long time ago i kinda buried that in my past i was a dropout as i didnt understand the degree program i was in it was mechanical engineering and before you ask why did i choose it for myself i didnt my parents did as usual theyve had complete control over my life but i did what i wanted and dropped out in the last year and started pursuing what i wanted just to clear some stuff its no use talking to them about issues either because they just dont understand and they think what they tell you is the only thing best for you what happened a few months ago is something i can never forgive them for there was a girl i was in a relationship with for years approximately we were good together and the girl wanted me to marry her since im a pakistani and my culture doesnt allow me to leave my parents out of any decision i take for myself it was mandatory for them to meet her parents for the proposal they were going there just because i forced them to not because it was something i wanted or for me to be happy and then just as usual they rejected her by telling me that shes not upto the mark which they were completely wrong about as they didnt even know her very well i cant do much to break this loop where my parents control my life to the point where i get depressed and theres no awareness about depression here in pakistan i just cant escape this life and do feel suicidal at times i sometimes still feel like ill be able to marry her when im capable enough but im running out of time i guess as her parents will find someone for her i have developed anxiety issues just because of them theres no use of talking to them about anything im becoming a bad person just because of them as ive stopped seeing positivity around me because of their behavior they taunt me and push me down everytime i never ever heard a word of motivation from them i keep my stuff to myself as i know they dont deserve to know what goes on in my life i just need help but i dont know how cant talk to anyone as i only have a few friends and they cant relate with me because theyre lucky to have good parents with whom they have a good bonding and a loving relationship i dont know how to fix my life
so recently i tried to commit and i sent my friend a lengthy message in base my mom and i share a phone number so she can see what i tell other people and so she can block the friends i have that she doesnt like and he ended up calling the police and when they left my mom yelled at me for being selfish and inconsiderate this is the same woman who is attempting to use my birthday to get the things she wants the same woman who makes me take care of my sibling and her the same woman whos belittled gaslighted and guilt tripped me for the past years of my life im the same woman who tells all her friends that im the problem and that shes doing her best when shes on her ass all day doing nothing but ordering me around then the day after that the police came back to explain some things to her in the letter i sent to my friend i had told him i was saed when i was younger and that they were going to open a case as well as call cps to investigate our home which is a mess im trying to keep it clean i am but some days i cant even get myself to change clothes let alone clean an entire house not to mention my sister who doesnt really have to do anything even the chores she does have i have to end up doing them for her because she refuses to do them then when i feel burnt out and just want to tune the world out i get yelled at and called lazy so today she made me clean the entire living room and kitchen there was mold under the freezer and kitty litter everywhere and so much trash then when i finally got done at pm i had been cleaning since pm right after i got home from school she accused me of stealing her tweezers from her bathroom which i did not then she yelled at me for not getting the dishes done even though i was cleaning h e r and her crotch goblins filth up not to mention i still have to mop the bathroom and do the laundry and change the kitty litters then i have to organize our room and resweep the bedroom i feel burnt out and tired i dont know what to do anymore anytime i try to get help it always backfires i feel like im drowning and i dont want to be here anymore im beginning to think that im just destined to be trapped here shes found ways to keep me here forever she uses my sister against me and favors her over me she says im the quote bad kid and sure she has her good moments most abusive parents do but i dont wanna take care of her anymore its starting to cause me issues in keeping my grades up i wanna be a kid and enjoy my life xb xb what do i even do at this point is there even a solution i just want to feel like i can enjoy myself without that fear in the back of my mind
so me and my mom just got into another fight where she yells at me and calls me degrading names while i forcibly sit there and take it and today she said if you dont pull your shit together im gonna stop caring then nobody will care and when that happens youre fucked when that happens youll end up homeless on the road living behind a dumpster and that evoked some sort of feeling within me apart from me already crying so now i wonder is saying that some sort of abusivemanipulative tactic for a toxic parent to use to make their child feel super codependent on them or am i just being dramatic

so my stepdad is very emotionally abusive and sometimes physically with putting me and my sister in headlocks and threatening to put our heads through walls my mom usually sees what he does but she cant leave him because for one shes gets disability checks so she doesnt work and my sister is about to move out i think the worst thing that he has done is either slap me in the face or grabs mine and my sisters thigh and tickles us by squeezing his hand over and over hopefully i put some pictures of him getting mad
from what i was told by my mother when my mother was pregnant with me my father would hit my mom and abuse her and manipulate her as far as what my grandma told me when i was born my father would sexually abuse me and my grandma kept me away from him as much as she could from what i remember when i was and my little sister was my father would drive me and my sis to his house to play video games to make friends with me then take me home one time however my father didnt want to change my little sisters diaper and made me do it remember i was at the time i struggled to change my sisters diaper and my father kept knocking on the door just to freak me out the whole time i also remember being in bed then my father would undress me and would make me sleep in bed with him i thought it was normal at the time then after a few hours of that my father would dress me again then drive us back to my cousins house where we lived at the time if it werent for my grandma id still be in that situation im in my double digits now yet not fully mature yet but im sure this is worthy of being here just so yall know most of this happened years ago and doesnt effect me now just thought it would be ok to post here

hi im new to this group and im hoping this is a safe space where i can share everything that has happened to me tw this story can get kind of graphic so if you dont think you can handle it please dont read this my bio dad wasnt ready to be a father his father had abused him and thrown him threw a brick wall when he was a young teen im not joking i believe he felt that he should treat me and my siblings the same because thats what he knew i guess he abused my two older siblings and my mother while i was still in her womb he picked up my older sister savannah by her hair when she was because she didnt want to clean her room he shook her by her hair and yelled do you want to clean now he did it again and picked her up by her french braids and swung her around the room he picked up my older brother caleb by his neck when he was three then dropped him like a sack of potatoes when my mother was pregnant with me he backed her into a corner and punched a hole in the wall right next to her head she punched him in his nose and broke it but he beat on her until she regretted it fast forward to me being years old we had our new house put in we were so excited but the torment only seemed to get worse as time went on my dad had been gone for a few months and i didnt think he was coming back but i was wrong he came back and lived with us again he beat us with a belt and screamed at us daily he was a big smoker he vaped smoked cigarettes and all of that i was the vulnerable one i didnt have any control over my emotions at all i couldnt even be in the same room with him without crying and i would get beat more for that my mother had to work because the sorry piece of shit that is my father wouldnt i have another little sister hannah and she was little during all of this so my mom protected her more but every once in awhile he would start to hit her and i protected her and shielded her from him fast forward to my mom got covid i was there to help her she was so sick it felt like it wasnt even real i got off the bus one day from school and i walked in the house her fingersnose and toes were purple and she was gasping for air my sister tricked her into going to the hospital by saying she was taking her to whataburger because she was hungry my older sister was fifteen and had a permit she got to the hospital and the doctors told my sister that if she hadnt of been there for more hours she would have been dead she was in the icu for months but it only got worse from there me and my siblings were staying with my really close family friends i was outside and just gotten home from school they live on acres and have a pretty long driveway ps i had to get picked up from school everyday early because my dad tried to kidnap me from my school i was sitting on the swing bench around the fire pit in the front yard and a green kia that looked like my sisters had been following us and had come up there road and gone back and forth continuously for a week or so he tried to kidnap me and my siblings from their house we were in hysterics he ended up leaving after he got told by the police he couldnt take us but that didnt stop him he tried to kill my mom in the hospital by saying he was her husband and he wanted to pull the plug he sent his girlfriend up there to get info on her saying that she was my mothers sister we had to put a code on any info on her so that if you didnt know her code you couldnt get any info on her he terrorized me and my siblings we couldnt even go outside without being terrified fast forward to me being my mother is out of the hospital and doing great we are so lucky shes still here with us today but things got worse for me i got sa sexually assaulted by my familys friend we had grown up with them our whole life i never would have thought he would ever do something like that his dad was like my dad he fathers me and my siblings still like were his own he sa me over and over for almost a month straight before i told my older sister savannah she was and his former girlfriend she broke up with him then i learned that he had done it to her and my cousin also jasper was my assaulter i was only i can still feel his hands on me sometimes and it makes me sick i was just a kid but that never lasted long ive had to have the mindset of n adult since as long as i can remember i didnt have a childhood we were and are not rich at all we sometimes wonder how we are going to get things done by a deadline well my mom anyway im now and i got caught vaping smoking and doing other really bad things i shouldnt be this was in the beginning of february im better now but my mom was so disappointed in me but my older siblings are under age and they do worse my mom lashes out on me if i tell her how i really feel i cut off my emotions so long ago i dont know how to turn them back on i cant cry anymore im just numb i disassociate and flinch when someone raises there hand to give me a high five i apologize too much and i get clingy easily and im sorry for anyone who is reading this if you had the same thing or worse happen to you i wouldnt be here without my best friend chasey she saved me from killing myself last year and my little sister hannah i love her so much im all she has our other siblings dont give two shits about us i moved out of my moms house and in with my grandma and two aunts they are gentle and never yell im so happy here but i must admit writing this has taken a toll on me because of the memories but ill be okay there is way more to the story than this but ill save more for another day please dont judge if you read this but can you tell me whether my father deserves to be in prison he already had multiple warrants out for his arrest but he a a professional criminal anyways thankyou for reading loves sorry its so long avaree
as ive mentioned i have trouble picking up social cues sometimes and with how my mom raised me its easy for me to jump to the theyre manipulating me cue and i know that my grandma can do the same was this one of those instances at this point its all sorta muddled together i am on low contact with them overall she is someone i talk to more where as my mom i only do so like every few months also idk if its relevant context but my mom has been on a downward spiral health wise and likely mentally i did cut out a portion but it just had my stepdads name and she just said that she told them to get disability yrs earlier so didnt seem too relevant after my message she stopped talking to me for a few hours and basically kinda ignored what i said and just started asking me to get my moms medical history she wants me to call around but i work graveyard i hate phone calls like anxiety lvl i dont think we can help someone who doesnt want help she got herself mixed with a shitty man who isnt my stepdad turned my stepdad into a literal door matt refuses to cut contact with the shithead she is too finicky one minute she wants him there the next she doesnt i understand patterns of abuse and know she isnt well but hell even the cops dont want to go to that house which is a whole other problem so i dont know how i could help hell i went on a whole rant sorry point is i dont know what my grandma wants from me an i held her in a good light growing up but these past few years ive more than realized that most the adults used me as a therapist growing up and she wasnt an exception to that and i just wanna know if my realization of that is clouding my judgement or just making the manipulation cues more obvious
i mean its been a while since ive felt fucked up but i thought once i left or went away from the source of those feelings i would feel so much better but i dont i find triggers and feel threatened with the smallest things i constantly feel the need to hate myself and find myself to shelter myself from people i really want to go back to being content with being by myself but i have a hard time doing so i have a hard time feeling happy i have a hard time feeling okay i have a hard time pretending like im okay im tired of pretending i was so good at that shit in highschool but now i can hardly do it im so drained and i find so passion or pull to do it i just want to tell people i hate them because i genuinely hate everyone cuz they will always find a way to hurt me and make me feel bad and less and awful i just find happiness with myself and myself alone
this is going to be a very very long story im gonna start by describing my familys situation on my mothers side my greatgrandparents were very successfull and had a lot of kids boys and girls the men in the family also became successful got married and had kids the youngest of the girls has trisomy and couldnt live alone the other girl is my grandmother my grandmother wasnt as successful as her brothers she met my bio grandfather who turned out to be very abusive and they had my mother my bio grandfather hated my mother because she was a girl and he wanted a boy he abused her and my grandmother and then left to have boys with someone else who ended up breaking up with him because he was still abusive my grandmother ended up meeting my grandfather and had my aunt on my fathers side i honestly dont know much because my father isnt one to tell stories about his family i know that my grandfather worked at the bank while my grandmother worked in whatever government stuff but they lacked nothing my father was fat as a child and he clearly has a complex about it he blames his mother all the time for that and hates fat people i had to do some research about my fathers life because he is very secretive he wrote a lot of books that cant be bought anymore none of them are being sold except for the only book that he published himself but looking at all the boxes full of his book i guess it didnt work from what i could find he mastered a lot of degree he always told us that he owned a company when he was younger but i couldnt find anything about it i did find a company that he worked in at some point but thats pretty much all now how those two families got together my father yo was married to one of my mothers cousins my mother yo was yo when she met him at a family gathering but only started a relationship when she turned my father had my older brother kevinyo with his exwife at that time when my older brother was born he was the golden child of the entire family everyone doted on him and he has been allowed to do anything he wanted as he grew older i nb am an affair child my existence had to be hidden from everyone my father only aknowledged me when i was yo after my mother told him that he had no legal rights over me as he didnt reclaimed those at that time because it would be too hard for my older brother at that time my mother was already pregnant with my sister melanyyo my father ended up divorcing his exwife and married my mother when it happened my moms entire family shunned her calling her a slut and she was not allowed to any family meetings anymore even my grandmother rejected her the only person who protected her was my greatgrandfather who was very ill and died when i was yo soon after melanys birth my mother got pregnant again with my little brother george yo due to financial difficulties we had to move a lot i cant tell you much about that part of my life because i was very young obviously i remember playing with my younger siblings i remember that we would always had very violent game and it always ended up with me having nosebleed i remember hearing my mother screaming and seeing my father beating her it happened when i was yo my parents were fighting again and i had a nosebleed due to my older brother violently kicking me in the face i went to ask my mother for help and my parents and i went to the bathroom i honestly cannot remember what they were fighting about but my father punched my mother in the face so hard that she was actually thrown against the wall her face became big and all purple and she ran outside as quickly as possible and locked herself in the car my father unable to get her out came back and put us to bed the next morning police officers came with my mother she told them that he was beating her her face obviously being the proof of it they responded by saying that there was nothing that they could do that it was only a couples fight and that if my mother was that unhappy she should get a divorce and they then left i had a huge black out and when i was yo my parents were not living together anymore the divorce procedures had started and they had split custody my fathers appartment was unsanitary which caused me to have huge asthma crisis of course my father never treated me for it and it all fell on my mothers shoulders it unfortunately didnt work and i still have trouble with my asthma both of my parents were working but my mother didnt have much money as she had to gave up her studies when she got pregnant with me and my father never allowed her to go to uni and ordered her to be a stay at home mom since my father never paid child support we were having a hard time at my mothers fortunately for my mother she met someone when i was yo and moved with him at the other side of the country which allowed all of us to have food on the table my fathers mistreatment towards us started almost as soon as he moved in his appartment i was diagnosed with depression and an eating disorder at yo my father was with me at the doctors appointment he never informed my mother it i never saw that doctor ever again my father gave me some paracetamol for a week and then claimed i was fully healed spoiler alert i was not to heal me from my eating disorder he applied a technique used by many parents not allowing your kid to leave the table until they finish their food leading me to spend most of my nights sleeping on the table my father distrust in doctors was so bad that once while we were having dinner melany shared with us that she had been having trouble pooping for a week instead of taking her to a doctor my father decided to put some gloves on and to unblock the path he sexually assaulted her i remember the screams and the blood as he was doing it in front of us i clearly remember his face while doing it and it wasnt the face of someone who felt guilty about it he was proudly smiling the whole time when my mother learned about it she tried to talk to the police and to doctors but they denied her the help saying that my father did the right thing later that year he met my stepmother agatha yo the first rule that my father instaured when we met agatha was to obey her as our own mother but not view her as our mother as she hated kids and didnt want any a fact that agatha would constantly remind us during my childhood their relationship was very chaotic agatha and my father would constantly argue everytime she left after an argument my father would start destroying whatever he could find i remember seeing him destroying the oven because it burned the pizza the pizza was burned mostly because my father was too busy fighting with agatha to check on it i think its after this event that my father would let my sibling and i yo at that time cook for ourselves as he was too busy again fighting with agatha when my mother left with her exboyfriend my father got fullcustody and we moved to agathas house since my mother didnt have any money the judge ruled that she would not pay child support we would only see her during the vacations my mothers new appartment was really small melany george and i had to sleep on the couch as there was no room for a proper bed we would rarely see my former stepdad during those vacations he worked in the army and was away most of the time their relationship lasted yo i think but they ended up breaking bc he cheated on my mother during those years he was pretty nice but it wasnt the kind of environment good for kids they would always go out to party while locking us in a room with no food water or access to the toilets the party would usually start around pm and end very late at night or the next morning i know that my mother was having a really hard time so i dont blame her anymore but as a child i thought she didnt care about us and didnt want us around i tried to talk about it with her recently and she doesnt even remember that she went to those parties while we were around so i decided to leave it be my eating disorder didnt get better and around the end of the relationship my former stepdad decided to instaure a new rule to force me to eat not allowing me to drink water if i wanted to drink i had to wait for them to leave the room and secretly grab a glass after their breakup my mom met her now husband matthew yo matthew is basically the father i never had he always goes out of his way to protect my mother and he cares about us they had my little sister alice yo back to my father when we moved to agathas we also had to change school melany was the only one who was accepted by the other kids i was rejected by them because my classmates didnt like strangers so i would spend most of my time with melany which bothered her a lot she thought i was stealing her friends as for george we didnt know it at first since they separated him from us but he was getting bullied everyday he was yo at that time at some point george was fed up with it and insulted them back it was the first time he used a swear word and the kid immediately reported it back to the teacher and got our parents involved what basically happened is that my father was very angry about it and took us to the other kids house i thought he would listen to georges side of the story but no he made my brother apologised to the kid and the mother and on our way back he stopped the car took our little brother out and left him on the side of the road he brought melany and i home while we were crying and screaming at him to take back george george was left min alone on the side of the road unsupervised agathas house was really nice at the beginning i had to share a room with my sister but there was enough place to keep our intimacy but it quickly went bad my sibling and i were crying every night for our mother and my father would yell at us to shut up telling us that our mother never loved us and abandonned us we had to cook and clean because we were living rent free when i went to middle school my father instaured a bunch of unreasonnable rules xb i was not allowed to leave anything in the locker i had to carry around all the school books all the time if it was not actively raining or snowing i had to go on bike if i was sick i wasnt when i was getting bullied i had to shut up and leave them alone because they would get tired of it spoiler alert bullies never get tired of it all these rules leaded to a lot of health issues my back started to hurt so badly i wasnt able to sit lay down or stand up without screaming even now my back hurts and i still dont know what i have because my father yelled at yo me so hard to stop screaming because i was only doing that for attention and the only thing i had to do is bear with the pain and i was so afraid that he would kill me so i stopped screaming my eating disorders and depression got worse but then again my father kept claiming that i was okay i passed out multiple times during middle schools and my father would claim it only happened because i didnt want to go to class i threw out blood and my father only said that i was being over dramatic and send me back to school the next day i would have asthma crisis so bad that i quite literally almost died once a car hit me once and other kids and someone called my father while an ambulance came and took the kids and me to a hospital i never saw any doctor that day because as soon as i got to the hospital my father took me out of it and brought me back to school saying that nothing happened that he knew who the person who hit us was and that he was a nice guy every time i brought up me being bullied i was dismissed with stuff like yeah we know its just you its normal just leave them be why do you even care about what they think what do you want us to do change school how are we supposed to do that so for years i had to endure of course people insult and laugh at me but also people pushing me grabbing my hair pushing me to the ground hitting me grabbed my arms and make me touch kids intimate parts those kids were also getting bullied throw my stuff or for exemple when i got hit by the car directly telling me that i shouldve just died at home my father and stepmother would quite literally blame us for anything that would happen whether we were involved in it or not from the moment i was yo to now my father would call me a manipulative compulsive crazy and hysterical liar an ungrateful princess saying that i was creating memories because i was an attention seeker agatha kept saying that she was glad we werent her real kids because we were such horrendous ones and if she was our mother she would have beaten the shit out of us that was only during the week it would get worse on the weekends when kevin was around he was a spoiled brat some kind of king who was clearly used to boss people around he was allowed to beat george and i because it was a childs fight even when my little brother would get beaten so hard that his face would get purple and all swollen even when that happened my father wouldnt scold kevin until my mother and her lawyer contacted him and even after that he would yell at us to stop telling our mother what was happening at our fathers house because it doesnt concern her quite a few things was none of her business according to my father like schools our health our grades our life in general it all got worse when kevins mother gave my father the full custody kevin was basically a nightmare at his mothers house he proudly told me that he pushed someone to suicide once and he never stopped being a bully in highschool and uni after moving in with us he purposely flooded his mothers house because he thought it would be fun he was yo at that time mature enough to know what you can and cant do at first my father was all over his golden child sympathazing with him it quickly stopped kevin was always fighting our father my father was getting more and more violent after agatha got pregnant with my sister sally yo the atmosphere got even worse the slightest inconvenience would create disproportionate mesures because of the pregnancy kevin had to sleep in the same room as melany and i we were always in conflict because of the light the alarm the music when kevin and my father had an argument it would always end up in my father physically assaulting my brother and then getting us involved in it my father would yell at us to say things like obviously were not scared of you while we were crying he made us thank him for beating us because we were bad children and how are parents supposed to educate their kids if they cant beat them when my sister and i started to have our period agatha would forbade us to use her pads and my father wouldnt buy us ones stating that he had once a girlfriend that was able to keep the blood in so i only had to do that he never took my period cramps seriously he would constantly yell at us to choose between him and my mother when i was so sick that it was clear for everyone that i couldnt go to school he would yell at me that i was lazy and that i could at least have done something to help i started to have night paralysis from yo to yo he never took those seriously called me crazy an attention seeker that i only needed to sleep and that if i couldnt it was because i didnt want to when sally was born i was still in middle school at that time my father decided that it was time to move out and started to look for houses to buy agatha got pregnant with ariane yo and it was more and more obvious that the house was too small for children we moved soon after i entered highschool into a huge house it was a really big place that only had one huge issue but not that huge obviously for my father the house was basically in ruins everything had to be renovated and when i say everything i mean everything agatha gave birth but the house was in such shambles that i had to take care of everything while they were renovating the house i had to take care of the babies of the food of the laundry of the cleaning while going to a new highschool i was bullied yet again in that new highschool because i stood up for someone and they didnt like it thankfully it only lasted for the first year i was left alone after that i met very good friends who taught me how abused i was and saved me on many occasions during the years i spent in that new house i became a maid i had to take care of everyone and do everything because my father and agatha would be too busy fighting over anything now to describe the renovated house at first we basically had no roof so the house was always cold and when it was raining the ground would be flooded after we had a roof he started to do things as he wishes without really concerting us the bathroom lacked intimacy anyone could see you on the toilets he also installed windows in the wall connecting the bathroom to the living room meaning that anyone could see you taking a shower if they wanted to he installed windows in the wall connecting my bedroom to the living room too when i was yo meaning that everyone could see me i had to hide in a corner everytime i wanted to get change or just wanted intimacy melany never had a real bedroom there was no door at all and half of her room was open to the rest of the house as for kevin he got kicked ouf the house for beating george of course my father wasnt the one that decided that agatha was the one who intervened she never liked kevin and i dont blame her for that she convinced my father and kevin went back to where we used to live agatha tried to leave him once when i was in uni he threatened her using her children and pointing out everything that made her insecure he also convinced her to not let the girls go to school anymore he would spend his days watching tv hating on women gay people and asians agatha had a job that was far away from the house he wouldnt clean the house at all and would wait until she came back to pick a fight with her over anything he could the house was so dirty that worms would come out from the shower after i was admitted to uni everything became more bearable since i was out of the house away from all the toxic environment i was struggling very hard with depression agoraphobia anemia and anorexia covid made it worse and my father forced me to go back home i was blocked there for months and those were the worst months of my entire life i have a panic attack every time its mentionned it was constant yelling stuff thrown around in the house no care for my little sisters constantly blaming us for anything thankfully for my bestfriend and his parents who allowed me to stay an entire month with them after all of that but i urgently needed to get away from agatha and my father i took the first job that i found and escape from their grasp i worked for years before quitting and i am now living with my mother im seeing a therapist and multiple doctors i learned th at i have endometriosis im getting treated for all of my problems for the first time in my life im able to sleep more than h my health problems were finally taken seriously of course im not fully healed but through my therapy sessions i realised that i was abused thats the first thing my therapist told me i was abused and i need to accept it and move on and ive come to the conclusion that writing all of this down and publishing it would be a great step into aknowledging my suffering i obviously changed the names and i didnt talk about everything because it would be way much longer thank you for reading all of it
when i was or my mother had started to forcefully wax my pubic hair through brazilian waxing i wasnt allowed to say no i lived in the middle east and it was seen as dirty for girls to have hair down there my mom thought she was doing me a favor by starting earlier because the hair would never grow as strong then she was wrong it hurt so incredibly bad she wouldnt take no for an answer all my aunts knew about this when i was i started doing it myself but it took me hours and my momwould tell me that she should do it for me because i never successfully removed every single hair according to her so i was forced to get my pubic hair removed from her nearly every two or months till the age of it stopped when i was and i was getting a brazilian wax by a salon lady i couldnt do it and finally put up a fight and came out crying in the middle we moved to the us afterwards and she just let me do what i wanted to groom my hair she mentioned a few times that i should get a brazilian laser and i refused i am now she doesnt do any such things to me anymore i didnt know what happened to me was weird until last year but now whenever i think about it i feel like throwing up i recently got a ptsd diagnosis because of the sexual trauma this and a few other csa incidents caused me but i fear fully disclosing this to a therapist would cause the the therapist to call cps i dont have a green card since i moved here two years ago so i rely on my mother for moneytransport etc i dont want to rat her out but i just dont feel safe in my body anymore my latest therapist appointment is on the th i dont know what to do before that
i am physically disabled and in a wheelchair ventilator oxygen feeding tube and i have round the clock nurses and caregivers i was going to go to the abilities expo this sunday in los angeles with my dad and sister but mom was going to go to her singing event she wasnt available from the start and then dad said he would go with me now hes yelling at me and complaining about how he wishes he can do gardening or something he enjoys and not spend his time going there for what well what about being a supportive parent is that too much to ask but i suspected this hes verbally abusive and doesnt care in general so i thought that sometimes it was good experiences that it wasnt all bad but now more and more im seeing times when theyve let me down im sad i wish i had supportive parents and not neglecting and abusive ones im i swear if i didnt have round the clock nursing and caregivers i wouldnt be ok i wish so badly i can move out of here im slowly dying emotionally living in this toxic place
tw brief mention of sa and physical abuse so my mom was contacted by the county in january because shes a hoarder she got so much worse after i moved out some of the things shes done in this situation made herself fall the day before i moved so i would stay home and be her slave tried to force me to be her caregiver by tattling to the social worker shes also still been ordering stuff and it piles up yesterday i was over to help the county clean out the house one room took up almost an entire pod sized dumpster obviously she is not of sound mind and needs mental help i want to keep things at a distance for other things she has done to me but in my opinion she needs mental health issued by the court i spoke to the case worker this morning about possibly getting the court involved but said since she seemed mentally sound that they likely wont rule in my favor for further context i am not refusing to be her caregiver for no reason when i was a child she physically and sexually abused me and i feel like this is a potential attempt to try and abuse me again or to keep me trapped in her house of horrors being a caregiver requires the person caring for an individual to help toilet or shower i refuse to put myself in a situation that could lead to being abused again
my parents got a divorce just before covid hit because my dad was constantly fighting with my mom and now that they are divorced my dad constantly yells at me f and my brother m i just cant deal with it anymore because if i mess up or forget something he starts screaming things like you useless bitch bastard fucking grow up fucking spastic fat cunt prick lazy fucking cunt and to add to all that hes racist sexist antivaxxer homophobic because of my father calling me things like a fat bitch i now hate my body and dont eat for a day then i binge eat and try to throw up after when he starts yelling i get scared that he will hurt me though he has never physically hurt me after arguing with me or my brother he comes through and says you know i only yell because i care about you another thing he does is he says horrible untrue things about my mom to my brother like she was and is a drunk which she is not and whenever i put on noise cancelling headphones to try and escape his yelling he just calls me autistic or if i hid under my blanket he says laying in your bed all day you lazy bitch the only reason i live with my dad is because of where my school is and i want to tell my mom about how sad depressed and scared i am but im really scared to it doesnt help that everyone in our town thinks he is a good guy and a great single parent because thats how he presents himself and they all believe my mom is the abusive person i just wish i could live with my mom because she would never say these things to me or act like this i just dont know what to do or who to talk to and i keep missing days of school because i just feel so depressed and anxious help please what should i do
my adoptive mom in quotes bc she was toxic asf would squeeze and compliment me on how big my ass was for context i was for some reason usually saying things like youll definitely make someone happy some day is this normal or as pervy as i think
f me f mom so my mom has been abusing me my whole life and its not secret shes always taught me what to say when cps came and how to protect her about a year ago i had called the cops cuz she had bitten my face during a physical altercation we had at that time i had just had knee surgery and had just gotten off probation for a dui and for two assault charges when i found my ex fiance sleeping with my friend one of the assault charges had gotten dismissed and the other lowered to a ticket but i knew i had to stay out of trouble so i called the cops by the time the cops got there my mom had called my dad and the situation was worked out so i tried to protect her by telling them we had worked it out on the other hand my mom was telling them i was on drugs and i was the aggressor when that wasnt the truth and i was on crutches and could barely walk at the time they believed her and i got the ticket and had to go back to court my mom eventually dropped the charges and told me that if i called the cops again she would do it again i felt betrayed because she had taught me my whole life to protect her but when the moment boiled down to it she was gonna throw me under the bus to protect herself so fast forward to this past week me and my mom had gotten into an altercation and she chased me with an extension chord hitting me and threatened to shoot me so i called the cops i remembered what happened last time so i told them the truth and she got arrested my mom is extremely angry with me and withholding the car from me and its taken a toll on how i get to work i found out today through a detective that the state is going to pursue charges but i can go to the district attorneys office and sign an affidavit to have the state drop the charges at first i was willing to run down there and sign the affidavit because i do love my mom very much and when times arent bad theyre good however i realized her fate was now in my hands and i can choose not to sign the affidavit if she doesnt let me have the car back is this morally wrong or is it smart also how would you handle this situation

my dad is awful ever since i was little my dad has treated me rudely he once got mad at me for telling my grandma that he called her a bitch behind her back i thought i was doing the right thing and all he had to say was look at her shes smirking i was just a kid he never apologizes or admits when hes wrong one christmas he just up and left our family because he was mad it got to a point where my parents fought so much that my dad asked me if i wanted to move out with him even though once again i was a kid he makes everyone tip toe around his feelings he has inappropriately touched my ass multiple times even though i told him i didnt like it and my mom doesnt even believe me he used to take the straps of my bra and snap them across my back he has made sexual gestures at me with his crotch by moving his penis around as a kid he used to get angry at me if i didnt say hi to him the first thing as he walked through the door he constantly tells me that i dont love him without me even having the chance to speak he constantly ruins our plans he told me dont start when i said me and my mom wanted to stay a bit longer at an event and then suggested to my mom that him and her should go by themselves because she hadnt had the chance to look around enough he literally made us leave the event my dad always tells me that i dont do nothing for him which i have decided not to due to the way he treats me i feel uncomfortable doing anything for him because of how he acts he always gets worried that my mom cheats on him while hes not home this is not the case as a kid he has called me a clown or a bitch constantly he play fights with me to the point where he actually hurts me i tell him it hurts but he doesnt believe me and gets mad at me all of this has greatly affected me and i now have ocd where everytime i think of him i have to do a compulsion to get rid of the thought i dont know if this is considered trauma but i wanted to ask someone to see if im overexaggerating i just want to know for my own peace of mind
i confronted my mother for the first time and told her that she is the culprit not the victim i feel like i am on the top of world i dont really like to be the mean girl and i probably wont do it again as it will change nothing but i am somewhat happy that i managed to say what i am thinking for once
saturday pauls birthdaymy stepdad i was stood in the way of the door and the cupboard in front of paul while he was reading his cards jennifer then puts her hands on both my shoulders i thought she was trying to move me out the way of the door so i try to move forwards out her way but she still kept ahold of me so i try to move backwards out the door because i still didnt know where she wanted me to go she then got angry and started shouting about how she was just trying to turn me around slightly to get into the cupboard discreetly to get pauls birthday cake how was i meant to know that thats what she was trying to do then jennifer starts shouting about how it all boils down to the fact that i dont like to be touched all of us where in the kitchen as well as jennifer having a raised voice at me so i raised my voice not to be directly disrespectful but so i could be heard she then shouts at me not to shouting at her i went to respond that shes shouting at me and i was trying to get her to hear me but before i could finish what i was saying jennifer grabs me by the crease in my arm and drags me out the kitchen and screams at me to go upstairs to my room when i went back upstairs my arm was red and covered in scratch marks where her nails and scratched me while dragging me i was then told later that night by paul that i need to watch what i say think before i speak and that is your mother sunday it was after half five because they where watching the football i came down and asked jennifer and paul what we were having for dinner i asked if we were having the pies in the fridge because i heard jennifer say that they where going out of date and needed to be ate and then jennifer and paul starting moaning at me that because id spent in tescos the day before on veg and other stuff for lunches and to go with dinners ect that i should be having them she expected me to have veg with cut up smoked sausage the chicken bits i bought for pasta and veg for my dinner then she said that i should take some of the pastas i made for lunch for the week and take some out of each and have that even though its meant ro be my packed lunches for the week she then went on about why do i need to have anything i the pasta meaning why cant you just have the pasta and the sauce i went back upstairs and around an hour later i came back down and asked if we where still going to see pauls cousins wife on hospice on the monday night after work and school because i was asked if i was able to go out by a friend and wanted to make sure that i wasnt still busy because nothing had been said about it in awhile i asked and jennifer said that it doesnt look like were going paul joined in and said he could get in touch with his cousin but it doesnt matter anymore since ive already got plans and i said to go without me then and he asked what the while reason is that were going id added in while he was saying that that i really didnt want to go to a hospice again because its a horrible feeling sitting there while someones dying i answered paul by saying that it was to see his cousins wife apparently i was already told by jennifer and supposedly paul as well that the plan was that me and emmy where going to walk to the chippy with sarahlouisehis cousins daughter i remember me jennifer and emmy talking about his cousins daughter and that she was ginger but paul definitely wasnt there and no chippy was mentioned i said that that mustve been to emmy because it wasnt to me i got really upset so i started to walk up the stairs jennifer stopped me and said that i better hope my gran janet doesnt end up in hospice because i wont be going to see her i turned back around and it started again and all said it was different if it was my family but i dont want to have to sit in a hospice again if i dont have too monday i came downstairs to get stuff sorted to leave for work monday morning and i reminded jennifer that i was going out with my friend then going to grandas to stay tonight i thought everything was fine and she asked why i said why not and she responded why aye i hadnt answered her because i was filling my water bottle up at the sink and then she just started shouting and screaming at me that was ignorant and other stuff and id asked what id done she asked why it is that im going to stay with granda tonight and not tuesdayi have a group tuesday night that doesnt finish til nine at night and it takes me around an hour to get home i said that it was because granda doesnt work tuesdays and that hell still be home when i wake up for work i went and grabbed packed lunch for two days and i have no clue if she was just acting stupid or just thought without me actually saying it that i wasnt going because she asked me why id grabbed two tubs of pasta i said it was because i was staying out and wouldnt be home to get it she kept going on about how me and her and spoke about this and how i should stay with my granda so that im not out too late we had spoke about it but not set plans all she said is that maybe its a good idea which i would agree with if i wasnt going to wake up to an empty house in my grandas she hasnt even thought that my granda might not want me staying there on a work night for him either but apparently i only think about myself i had to leave so i walked towards the door saying i needed to go she scoffs clearly angry that im not going to sit there and listen to her crap she walks over and opens the door for me and tells me to get out so i walk towards the door and as soon as im close enough she pushes me out and slams the door so hard that the letter box next to the door rattles i go to walk up the street and she opens it again and says that ive not to bother staying with granda because she doesnt want me to taking that attitude to her fathers she was shouting this at me in the middle of the street again angry that i didnt entertain her and just kept walking she started texting me saying the exact same thing and says ive to take it to my gran janets

hello i need advice sorry if im in the wrong thread but i decided to post here anyway heres some context right now im struggling going with adhd slightly depressed no college degree working part time at work and as a student at a community college living withoff my parents ive lived life where i was accidentally hit by my dad who didnt know his own strength when i got problems or had difficulties understanding problems as a kid and eventually stopped when the youngest was born im used to being told or treated like im stupid by both my parents my siblings who learned from their behavior through their words and actions im told i should give up going to college i was the scapegoat in the family everything i did was wrong or could be criticized theyd say shit like my personality was bad or i would lose all my friends due to my character whenever i tried to argue or fight back i was always the defensive one that argued back whenever i didnt want to be silent everything always felt like it was my fault and i could do nothing but deal with it my siblings are successful and graduated college so naturally its my fault because they turned out perfectly fine it was about year ago when their behavior changed and they decided to be nicer i assume it was a mixture of a rise of mental health awareness through social mediathe internet and my sisters friend committed suicide due to depression they would suddenly give me more attention buy me food take me on walks have pleasant conversations and just be generally ok or decent nice even and it seemed like my dreams came true or the great change i hoped things would be but i could not help but be wary there were times they acted differently for a week and then revert back this one was different in that they seemed to care more or put more effort it or it lasted longer than a week i questioned them even when they started treating me better due to previous experience the questions would lead to fights and arguments from the arguments i learned they didnt really change in mentality i was still the crazy stupid one nothing was ever their fault and that they did their best i should just forget or forgive everything i was the one who wasnt good enough i should be thankful i wasnt killed my parents were also abused as children and their abuse was far worse since my siblings and they themselves have been successful i should be successful and this it is not their fault theyre right in a way im so lost on what to do what should i do
i am an adult now and am about to move in a couple of months i have experience driving but have made no progress in the two years i have been technically learning to drive so i am as good as i was when i first touched the wheel its been about months now since i tried driving and i want to learn before moving the last time i drove my mother freaked out and jolted the steering wheel making me almost crash into something because i came within two car lengths of another car even though i was slowed down to at least mph and was continuing to slow i think it was unnecessary and that she overreacted but of course i was the one that got chewed out and punished for it it was not the only time something like that happened but it was my last straw my dad is very laid back and i actually drive a lot better when he is in the car but mom wants the liberty of being the one to teach me how to drive i have to suck it up and drive with her because she will not allow me to learn anywhere or from anyone else does anyone have any tips on learning with her and or any videos that may help i have a friend i may be able to ask for help but its not a guarantee
tw i dont know who to talk to abt this im too afraid to tell anybody because it would make things worse me and my brother are both victims of a very narcissistic mother im afraid though because what if im overreacting because she constantly tells me she loves me but everyday she is screaming and shouting hitting and my dad does nothing abt it even though i have tried to tell him so many times on what shes like when he isnt around im so exhausted i dont want to constantly make up excuses of why i never go out or why i can never go on my phone i have had things thrown at me i have been thrown across rooms im so scared of her but love her so much and im so hurt because i dont know who to talk to about it except my brother hes younger than me but she has never laid hands on him i think its partially because he is a boy i have tried talking to her so many times but she just makes up excuses for her behaviour she constantly thinks everything i do is because i hate her and am out to get her she believes everything i do is out of spite to annoy her and i cant deal with walking on eggshells anymore i have taken overdses which both failed but its because it has been so bad at home and at school i dont know what to do anymore i am so miserable and i cant live like this please i need advice on what to do im and i cant runaway so how do i just endure it
the title is pretty selfexplanatory but i just tried to off myself and i thought that maybe i should leave something before i go let everyone know why i did what i did this is not going to be gramatically correct at all because im shaking a lot lol i dont know how to start this off but yeah i just got thrown into my room without any dinner ive been debating writing a post on here for a little while me and my twin brother got into a fight and he pulled a knife and started threatening me so i locked my door and called my mom shes on a business trip so she couldnt do anything i want to tell her its not her fault after my dad thrown into my room i looked up signs of abuse and i read through the whole thing afterwards i broke down my dad took away my phone so i cant call my therapist or anyone and im writing this on a year old laptop i cant even get my dog i can only wallow in selfpity i have school tomorrow and i dont know what to do anymore i cant go out of my room to shower or grab my backpack either and ive talked about this with my mom my dad used to hit me and my brother when she wasnt home or on a business trip she said she didnt remember i told her that i couldnt live like this anymore and she tried to talk with my dad and things got better for a little while but its going back to how things were and im done i cant anymore so this is my goodbye i know im being a bitch and being selfish but i just cant anymore
i think i might know the answer but its just not good enough for me i believe it could be of things me my brother have different dads i think she possibly disliked my dad more than his dad and took it out on me my mom thinks men are just better than women and i know she treats men better i went through utterly horrific abuse from my mom verbal and physical and what did my brother get oh anything he pleased and he was such a demonic little child he would kick my knee caps then run to my mom and said that i hit him just so she would beat me its mother fucking fucked up i wonder why this happened to me its been years and i still fucking hate my mom and my brother for it i was an angel daughter i didnt do drugs drink alcohol smoke none of that i didnt even have boyfriends because i was a lesbian out of all things she was okay with that so why beat me fast forward to now my brother is a total degenerate burn out loser epitome of failure smokes drinks and does drugs he quit his first job after his first day and my mom continues to believe in him meanwhile i got a degree certifications and my own business and i still dont think she sees me as fucking successful ill always carry this hate around with me
before you say something about pregnancy i have an iud which my parents are aware of i year old f almost years old am in college and have been for almost a year and my parents refuse to treat me like an adult recently i have had the option to choose my dorm for next year and decided to become roomates with my boyfriend of at the time of moving in will be years with him when i told my parents they absolutely freaked out and said they do not approve and said i have to get permission mind you my parents said i can sleepover at my boyfriends house and do whatever i want when i turn btw my boyfriends mom doesnt care cuz we are legal age and my mom tried to use that argument and when i said his mom didnt care she dropped that argument and made other one the reason why i wanted to dorm with my boyfriend is because we would be dorming in the same building anyways and i have to save money as i will be paying for my housing plus i dont want to live with strangers and thats my only other option i tried explaining this to my parents but they kept saying no when i asked why they brought up my grades i stated that i have a and higher in almost every class and im with my boyfriend all the time anyways so that doesnt make sense then they kept bringing up other arguments and wouldnt give a valid excuse i tried asking my parents to hear out my side and talk to me as an adult rather than a kid if they want me to act like an adult i asked them to stop shutting me down and at least try to listen to me and my mom said no she said she doesnt want me to take on this responsibility but ive already taken on this responsibility because i hang out at his dorm all the time and sleep there with my parents knowing there is a lot of other stuff that i can include in just didnt want my post to be long let me know what you think though please and if you want more is this toxic what do you think is this relationship dynamic with my parents sorry for the long read
if you had an accident and suffered from amnesia regarding your traumatic childhood would you want someone to remind you of what your parents did to you before your amnesia or would you prefer not knowing about the past and being able to build a completely new relationship with your parents
me f and my sister f moved in my with dad after living with my abuse mother and her husband bit of background my step father sexually abused both me and my sister at young ages he was aggressive would hit us and my mother and there was levels of neglect as well and it ended up getting took to court for me leaving my mother at years old after all this was hard for me i still missed her and pined for her love and affection but after the court case i never seen or spoke to her since because she took her husbands side so its been years and i genuinely hate mothers day i usually just like to spend it with me and my sister when i was younger i used to make mothers days cards score out the mother and put father then give it to my dad and he loved this can i also add my dad is an extreme level of narcissists however as the years went on and i got older i grew out of doing that for my dad and it just became more of a day for me to genuinely try ignore everything related to mothers day my sister still tends to buy him a mothers day card and put both our names on it but i dont bother and she only does it to keep him happy because any other year on mothers day when he hasnt received any kind of recognition he tends to make snide comments and go in a mood he is of the impression that he is intitled to mothers day and fathers day because everything hes done for us he done bare minimum and thinks me and my sister should be grateful as he took us off my mum when he didnt need to he often says things like i could have easily of lefts yous there i didnt need to take yous in anyway my sister is days into a new breakup and she was with her boyfriend for years so she isnt taking it well and shes struggling and on top of that its mothers day so she feels awful she gave him his mothers day card and he made a comment is that all i got and then proceeded to ask her to go see my gran with him however shes really not in the mood and is struggling mentally plus sitting in my grans house is just another reminder that we dont have a mum my sister replied to my dad no and he took the huff slammed the front door and left the house and has turned his phone off so we cant contact him please tell me someone agree that the level of selfishness coming from him is absolutely not acceptable on a day of all days when me and my sister struggle as well as her dying of heart break he is acting this way oh and my sister have really bad anxiety due my dad has his unpredictable narcissistic behavior and he knows this as hes acknowledging that shes an anxious person because of him so he knows by leaving the house the way he did and turning his phone off will send my sister into a spiral
i think im genuinely starting to resent my mom for the second time in the past few weeks shes accused me of doing something wrong the first time i was up late playing a game on my phone since i was off work the next day the second time tonight while im trying to sleep she claimed she heard loud noises from my room and call me on the phone to say god is watching me and satan is busy then i started hitting myself out of anger and frustration and she said those are the same noises she heard earlier usually id tearfully talk to her about it but im sick of this fucking cycle shes making me hate her and religion talking to her and crying make me feel better but im sick of talking to her and i cant seem to cry now i got my blade and almost cut something so that at least the blood would feel like a tear but i just decided to post here
my dad has been well established to be at the very least emotionally toxicabusive by my therapist who even came out and told him you need to figure out if you care more about having a relationship with your daughter or having her follow your every rule that hasnt done much since he hasnt really changed but theres something i used to think was normal that i recently started realising might not be im not allowed to eat apart from certain time frames and im not talking about no food after pm kind of stuff if im not awake and eating by am yes on the weekend im not allowed to eat until lunch if i have a snack i have to hide it from him or hell start going on about how fat and unhealthy i am im kg cm years old female my mom says its insane as a rule alongside a bunch of other rules of his like no napping on the couch no being in bed apart from sleeping no having dark clothes on the couch no sport clothes to go out and some more stuff i always thought it was normal to not be allowed to eat unless you wake up before a certain time but more and more people have started telling me its not and i should be allowed to eat when i want with healthy boundaries of course is it truly abnormal does it count as abuse i dont know if its just a strict parenting thing or if its another toxicabusive trait my dad has
i wanted to go to college but i cant because i need my parents taxes because i live under them but both of them have to agree my stepdad doesnt want to help me if they dont help me my family will be in chaos because my stepdad recently been to the hospital and if he didnt go there he wouldve died then the house the cars the insurance will be over my head and my siblings are too young to do anything my mother is pregnant not to mention my stepdad owed somebody
since i was little i remember my mom being loving and caring but once i grew up everything changed for what i remember my mom would always call me thing you shouldnt say to your child like youre so dumb youre not good for nothing your cousin is so much better than you or would compare me with the rest of the girls at my school at some point she started to hit me just for a simple mistake i would make i remember seeing the mark of her hand on me all red i would beg her to stop and to treat me better but she would look at me and smile like she wanted to laught she never cared about what i was saying and until this day she still doesnt one day i was asked if inwanted to move the the united states i said yes it was my dream at that time when i started school i was doing okay until i was being sexualise by this boys in my class i was never thought about being sexuallied so the next day my paresnt were going to drop me at school in the morning and i told them ai didnt want to go they asked me why i said i was being bulllied by this boys in my class my school never believed me and the friend if this boys were defending them at that time me and this kids we were years old and these kids and their friends were acting like years talking to grown men and women and sexual stuff because i wasnt like them inwas called immature i didnt understand why so this made me really depressed to the point i wouldnt want to go to school and wanted to die my parents would scream at me and be mad at me in the morning because i didnt want to go to sxhool i still would stay and each morning mh mom would go out to the store and my dad to work every time they were gone i would go downstairs and get a knife to kms but i was never able to so i would try the next day one day i didnt notice my mom was home and i did the same routine as always get the knife my mom went downstairs and she was going to make breakfast but she noticed the knife was going she went into my room and asked me if i had it i said yes bc i trusted her and thought she would help me and listened to me but no she closed the door so hard and she went downstairs i heard her talking on the phone with someone then the police came they took the knife and told me to change inwas asking if i was going to be lock in a kids jail for crazy kids like my mom would always tell me because she thought i was crazy like my grandma her mom who has mental problems then an ambulance came ans took me to the mental hospital there was this woman she was the translator and i still remember who means and rude she was worn me she asked me questions about what was going on and let my parents stay in the room but when she was going to ask them what was happening she took them out of the room but forgot to close the door completely and i could hear my mom saying i wanted to harm her with the knife this was very traumatizing because i told the doctors it wasnt truth and they all scream at me that if i dojt change they would look me in for ever so i stayed quiet and we went back home after that i remember asking my parents to send me back with my grandpa they never did they would shut me down then in grade i was actually started to get bullied and i would tell my paresnr but never believed me in each class my classmates would call me names and the teachers would never do anything in grade a girl wanted to fight me because i was supposedly talking bad about her which i never did i barely even knew her after the day the girl wanted to fight me i didnt go to school and my mom was so mad at me she was saying inwas stupid and just like my grandma once again i remember telling her if you hate me so much why did you have me she said if i knew you were goig to be like this i wouldnt have you in th grade i keep getting bullied i would try to ignore it but in every class was the same thing mostly in art class the teacher was so mean to me i went to the counselor so they would change my class and i told them why they didnt care and didnt change it so i had to beg my mom to go to school so they would she got tired and finally decided to go i beg her to change me to another school and she said no until covid started and we moved to another town she finally changed me off schools because the school had email her that inwas out of the town and i couldnt be there i remember her telling me it was my fault from how many problems i had bring and so many absences when she stayed to change me from school i told her i wanted to do online she would look at me with so much hate and said no we had a fight about it and she just change to this school were they actually cared and let me stay in one room for all my classes but no it didnt stop there when it was covid these school made go to school will in quarantine inwas till adfraid i would get bullied i remember telling my mom i didnt want to go and she just drop me at the door and i followed her crying that i didnt want to and she went and lock her self in the car i was crying telling her to open the door and she said do you want me to call the police look they are right there and started laughing i was scared and i was wondering why she would do that since im still traumatized i had to call mh dad and tell him what was going on and he called my mom to open the door for me on the way home she was saying so much negative stuff about me after a few years later my mom started to see and hear thing that arent there over those years we became closer besy friend basically she came to my room once and told me cal the police bc i cant infront of your dad please i said why she said because theres people outside screaming at use that they want to murder us and i want the police so they can take us out of here i said that the police wouldnt remove them from the house to somewhere safe then she would make stay at hotels with her because she was scared of people trying to hurt us she did this while i just had my appendix removed once we came back home she asked me who was the girl i was talking to i said is this girl i meet on tiktok she asked were she was from i said from scotland now i regret telling her that because now she came up with the fairy tail that mu friend that ive been friends with even before all of this is the one that is trying to harm us i told her that she came up with that after i told her about my friend and it was all a lie and she said yea sure she told her sister that i give me private information to people that i dont know which isnt true mh mom was sent to a mental hospital because of all of that she came out of theyre sooo mad at me for no reason at all then she beg mh dad to send her to back to her country with her family he did and so i did because i wanted to see my godparents who actually care and give me the parenting love i should have received when we went back to our country my mom was doing better but my grandma started with stuff blaming my mom for stuff and bothering me so i went off on my grandma for it my mom went and said i dont care if you fail your classes but if you keep going line that we are moving to the other house and you wont have wifi to be able to to your assignments thats not all she was started to call my das that stayed in the us and she would facetime him and get naked to show him and rub her chest literally next to me and say sexual stuff to him my aunt for the us came to spend time with us and i wanted to go home so i told my mom and she no you have a suprice coming soon i knew it would be my dad and were we were worn my aunt theres was only rooms for my aunt and her husband and for me and my mom i remember crying at night because iknew my parents would have intimacy next to me because they have always done that since i was little which has traumatized me and now i feel uncomfortable when theyre together since they sexualize everything infront of me my mom started to look at me with such a hatred look every time i would talk to her or ask her a question since i knew my parents would have sex right next to me i stayed every night when my grandma and during the day with my godmother my mom came to the room i was staying at my grandmas and she said pack everything because we are leaving and you are not staying here at night i said why didnt you told me this before i have assignments to do that are due tonight she said pack everything i had to argue with her to let me stay at my grandmas she said no im going to be waiting for you outside i finished my work and i wanted to stay at my grandma but she wouldnt let me so i packed everything and i left with my pateando ti the house we were staying my mom told me to pack my stuff and while i was doing that i asked her where was my nitendo switch charger and she said in one of those bags i said which one and she said in one of those this was because she was talking wit her sister in the phone i kept packing my stuff since she left the room and i thought she would get it and i asked her did you find the charger my mom looked at me with this ugly look on her face and i said why are you looking at me like this since we got here you been looking at me with so much hate she has holding a show and she hold it up as she was going to hit me and said you respect me i said how am i supposed to respect you if you dont she keep getting closer and i started tk scream

not too long ago my girlfriends mom ended up getting sick and we have gone to the doctors we got the results and it gave us a really big health scare and started to plan for the worst but it had me thinking about my own mom who i havent spoke to for years now i decided for myself that i couldnt live my life with her in it she always cause trouble and put us all in danger with lies and all kind of things i have been severely abused by her mentally physically and sexually mostly she had other friends come over to play with me i know that she knows what happened to me she took off my dress at a party once presenting me this has left me with an extensive list of diagnosis as ptsd borderline heavy anxiety chronic stress and paranoia paranoia came after when she started to stalk me but now im at a point where i wonder how things will be when she finally actually dies its a sad thing to wish upon someone but i genuinely believe everyone will live a better life without her but how will i feel ive always said that i have mourned who i wanted her to be but in the end she is still my mom im so scared of my feelings and how i will cope with it will it be just like another day or will i shut down i know you cant give me answers but i was hoping to hear some other peoples experiences thank you for taking your time to read this and sorry for my spellinggrammar

i understand this seems harsh but im desperate and according to semi unclear word of mouth whoevers handling my case will reach a verdict this monday i have a history with cps i was taken from my mother for years when i was too young to remember it which im hoping will help my case since i have no documentation of the verbalpsychological abuse my mother puts me through almost daily for background knowledge that may help everyone in my house is addicted to weed and my mom and stepdad also drink daily and do cocaine no theyve never gotten physical over it but theres been a few non drug related instances where my parents have gotten physical with me or destroyed things of mine as punishment during an intense argument one day my mom made me take my pants off in front of her because they were hers i walked out my door to my neighbors house to ask for pants and she dragged me back in the house by a chokehold that same day she literally spit in my face theres been an instance where my stepdads gotten up and pulled my hair forcing my head up to look at him during an argument there was a time my mother made me kneel on rice holding my arms out straight with several thick booksthink dictionaries school text books so on and so forth she intended for this to go on for an hour but i only lasted minutes there was a time my mothers thrown my phone down the stairs breaking it entirely and theres been a few instances where shes popped me in the face my mother is extremely verbally abusive moody and controlling she insults me often and throws threats theres barely food in the house most days im not eating i used to live with my abusive dad until he went to prison i know the abuse he put my mom through is well documented which is something else im hoping can help my case and i live with my brother whos over the age of right now who raped me twice when i was but his record was wiped clean because he did some juvie therapy or some shit while he was locked up has anyone whos been replaced by cps lied about something that significantly helped their case if i have no documentation of the circumstances around me do i have a chance of being taken at all

dear dad i miss you i think about you all the time i dream about spending time with you and talking to you almost every night i get confused during the day because i always feel like i was just with you theyre positive memories but the version of you in those memories isnt the real you you havent treated me like that youve been absent selfabsorbed and judgmental my entire life so when i wake up i have to remind myself all over again how you really were as a father but i still miss you i miss those fleeting moments when you would reward me with your attention and praise i lived for those times i was like a starving person you starved me of affection i believe that you had control of your actions if you didnt thats pretty sad a grown adult who couldnt manage more than a few hours a week with his kid to be honest even when you were with me you often made me feel stupid or lesser or insignificant you were always so critical of little things that didnt matter you could never correct me as gently as i needed all of that pales in comparison to your actual rudeness intolerance and cruelty screaming at me about gaslighting when you couldnt even articulate what was wrong dragging me to a wedding i wasnt even allowed to attend as myself i disobeyed you the night of the wedding and nothing bad happened because of it by the way i told people who i was and they simply accepted me something you couldnt comprehend in our last conversation even after i told you how much youd hurt me when i tried to come out you made a joke comparing me to a serial killer is that really what you think of me no wonder i havent talked to you in years if thats what you have to offer i really wish i had the father of my dreams but i dont i dont even have you because you chose other priorities over treating me with respect you have officially failed as a father honestly its a miracle im even still alive i owe that all to my partner youll never know them theyre everything to me and you dont get to see that you dont deserve to im going to give all the love i would have given you to them your son is dead kindly fuck off morgan

im curious if anyone else had this rule growing up in total i have siblings but growing up it was mainly me and my sister and little brother growing up me and my big sister would fight as per norm being the only girls and years apart my mothers rule was she didnt care who started the fight the one the was crying would get beat wether from slaps with the handbeltor broom stick we learned from a young age not to tattle on each other and try to handle things ourselves out of fear sometimes it would result in us physically fighting the fights would be so bad because we knew who ever was crying the worst would get beat after even if not in the wrong or the original instigator we physically faught a lot and even seemed like we hated each other when the family split we got extremely close and even closer when our mother passed away did anyone else have a rule like that i feel like me and her were pitted against each other in a way once again thank you too those that took a stroll down memory lane im sorry for the long read and im sorry if i may of triggered a bad memory for anyone here this is better than therapy tbh
so im not sure if this is the right place or not and its my first time doing something like this so i hope a mod will lmk if this is the wrong subreddit im year old male just call me asura raised in what i guess you could call a modern islamic household by an indian father and a senegalese mother in an upper middle class familly in europe let me prefice this by saying my dad atleast dod the bare monimus as a parent when it cane to me and my brother something he cant even bothered to do for his last two children i used to look up to my father he was always well dressed well spoken well mannered and i thought well educated but i know now that wasnt the case my parents split up when i was around ish i cant remember and my father well spoken as he was poisoned me against my mother at the time who one day just took me and my brother and up and left so at first i saw my mother as the bad guy and it didnt take a lot from my dad to make me hate her she tried but back then for about to four years i was a real demon to her and any partners she may have had constantly fighting getting in trouble or screaming matches and smashing shiti have been diagnosed by clinical psychologists to be both lightly bipolar and lightly autisitc apparently i was young angry bullied and confused and that was used by my father who most likely manipulated me in to hating her by lying about a whole lot of stuff because hes a counselorpsychologist and very very well spoken i cant stress this enough but once i moved back with my dad i started realising hes not the person i thought he was he never hit me which i honestly would uave preffer over the verbal hour long lashing he gave me and my brother that made me feel like less than dhit especially because he meant the world to me but he was so ready to verbally abuse me things got even worse when he married his now after or so years exwife my exstephmother who will be called that bitch from now on i was obviously not the favorite as i was given all the chores aside from cooking and actually cleaning the laundry as a year old i litterally did everything else plus i had to basically babysit my full blood brother go out to clean his messes amd my two half brothers as they were born aside from dinner and laundry i basically kept the household running untill i was if i ever got upset about i would be gasslit and litteraly told that this would have been normal if i was a girl coming from a man who has six sons and now broken marriages over the years i was denied food with a full fridge plenty of times due to that bitch saying it was for her children and then offering it to guests instead they were emotionally unavailable to the point i basically raised myself and if i ever told my father anything it was just ammo he would use against me later he would always present us as a perfect familly but then turn around and abuse all of us gasslight and every other form of non physical form of abuse i can think of my father has calledme every derogative term under the sun and that bitch has made racist comments about me alongside all the other insults she hurled at me and when i brought it up to him hed tell me to suck it all up because they are a team and even that btich will admit mow that living with this man is constantly walking on egshels becuase like a veteran soldier if anyone yells at me or i hear yelling voice i will completely shut done bordering on not functioning anymore and had no confidence or a positive self image for years because he kept telling me i was an arrogant egotistical and thankless ungratefull bastard his actual words to his own year old son this is not even going indepth about the vindication as i could write a book about him when my full brother moved back to live with our mother again after a short while it became even worse for me my workload increased all the while being forced to get good grades with the threat of punishment even though i didnt have the time or enery to study and while he clearly saw i was depressed and doing horribly decided to guiltripgasslight me in to feeling better by comparing my blessed childhood with his man was kidnapped insulted and physically abused to the point of landing in the hospital by my grandfather and always at boarding schools back around ish and the discrimination and stuff was even worse and told me to suck and up and change right then and there hed aslo diminish any accomplishment i ever made by recounting all the grandiose things he did evem though he has accolades to show for them and would take credit for my achievements as if they were his own the time i got my next belt in karate he would tell me a taekwondo grandmaster handed him his blackbelt after only on le training session saiying my achievement is nothing special and then brag to all his friends how id made the next level all thanks to him some therapist right anyways it got to the point i started smoking cigarretes and weed to calm down at around the age of as all of this litteraly went on untill i was and forced to move out while i slept on the street and he went on a holiday to africa i helped pay for unable to even finish highschool even though he put such an empahsis on my grades that were always around or higher unless i was particularly bad at a subject i wasted my time with nothing for a few mitnhs before finding my own place and strarting a job its been about to years since ive been living alone and working and finally im starting to feel good about myself but buckle up the worst is yet to come turns out i was last place to a woman who never gave him any form of affection i mean this litteraly as she would never ever join us for anything never kissed or hugged him and only fucked him for the kids and he still had two children while in his sixties he back and then and now still admitted to not wanting saying that even while i was a minor the only reason i wasnt forced to pay rent i had a partime job was because i had all the responsibilities of a parent but none of the disciplinary measures towards my litttle brothers who i basically raised on my own because their parents couldnt be bothered meanwhile bragging to everyone he knew i was his pride and joy and the one son that never abandoned me and then in the same breath would switch to tearing me a new asshole in a crowded room filled with strangers in situations where he turned out to be wrong blaming me like the time i had to redo a grade or i fought with my brother after he litteraly almost gave me grave bodily damage by jumping on me from about two stories high and lauging it off as a prank i tried leaving multiple times but thats when he started treating me as his possession and jailing me to keep me bound to him as i lived alone i realised that he was self centered a hypocrite a liar a manipulating narcissist probably a sociopath a wife beater hes beaten both mymother and that bitch and a whole host of other things example whilst constantly trying to hammer home i was the precious son that never left him hed never listen to a word i said in serious discussions or otherwise and would even take the word of strangers over my own then after years of me basically raising my half brothers who still dont respect me by the way couldnt even stand up for me when a stranger planted the idea in that bitches head i was gay and a pedophile and would rape them which i would never i cleaned their diapers for christs sakes and now that that bitch is finally dicorcing him all the problems i had with her and he had with her that i contsantly told him about when he ignored my concerns is exactly what hes complaining about and even though this is his fourth broken marriage my dad has six kids im the rd the first one he hasnt seen in years and my elder brother me and my younger brother dont want to speak to him the man isnt even conscientious enough to even bother with self reflection even though his own words and morals hes cheated and abused her by having romantic conversation considering courtship with other women which still counts as infidelity to me and our religion and beating his wife same things he did to my mother by the way i could go an on but let me get to the point now heres the thing the reason why nobody has put him in bis place is becuase hes with a serious heart condition and the most stubborn holier than thou self centered asshole youll ever meet for a long time i considered airing out my problems like an adult as he constantly urged me to do especially because he always talk about how hes sorry for what my little brothers have to go through the same post marital war i went through as a kid even though hes the instigator of all the abuse and im talking about the worst things you can imagine no its not an exaggeration and does this in front do a and yeard old that he now cant even be bothered to raise i dont even want to bother because its just not worth the energy it would take because its not like he would listen to me anyway i just dont bother talking to him or reciprocating the affection he tries to show me i dont even talk to that bitch anymore and refuse to interact with her because id honestly rather send both of them to the hospital i used to visit my little brothers and be there for them whenever i could but im dont really feel like doing ecause they dont respect me or listen to a single thing i say when im trying to be serious with them and when i go to visit there im just emotionally drained and no matter how much i love them i have to move past and leave them behind in order to live for myself now that im finally free of that bastard who birthed me so hes tried telling me i should talk to a therapist but i refuse after having tried it multiple times for multiple reasons my father is ironically enough a horribke listener and untrustworthy cps and the divorce court never bothered listening to me or even giving me the time of day and for the most part all the therapists i have tried talking to just give me the same advice i can see coming from a mile away thats not helping talking about doesnt feel like a relief and only brings up old emotions which still kake me short circuit and now that i am finally learning how to he myself its not because i went to therapy but because i decided to pull myself up by my bootstraps and decided to fix both myself and my life and ladtly because once again he as a therapist and life coach idk what his actualy label is can not be trusted and because he said i shukd just change if i was tired of my shitty sotuation i see as seeking mental help as something only a weakling would do which is also the reason i grew up to be a quiet person that avoids confrontation i honestly dont want to either at his point hence the title is my dad the abusive bastard i think he is and should i still seek therapy any thougts in general would be apreciated as well ps i have contact with brothers not a lot because we all live in different households with differing schedules and a decent distance away from each other including from the and year old who live minutes away on the bicycle i havent seen my eldest brother whos like i think since i was a baby pps i ended up reconnecting with my mother during years of no contact while i was homeless becuase at my lowest point she showed back up in my life to support me and id say its thanks to her im still alive ppps yes i am aware i have a whole host of mental issues and a lot of skeletons i still struggle everyday but i am working on them and lastly no i will never forgive him for abusing my mother and hinestly i feel glad hes suffering as much as he is anyway that was everything it ended up being way more than i expected and im sorry for the wall of text for those who are still reading thanks feel free to comment or reach out to me through dm it might be a while as im not very active on reddit though
told my dad i was looking at places and will hopefully have one in the next couple months not what i he wanted to hear i guess immediately was told to pack and leave
so i have a friend whos parents are physically and mentally abusing her and its been getting worse as the years go by cps isnt doing shit and ive tried a lot of hotlines and nothing is seeming to work shes been getting extremely suicidal and has even told me shes gonna run away im really worried and dont know what to do please help
context i had a boyfriend who was not mormon and my parents are mormon i am years old
general tw this is ment to act as a vent and possibly to get some advice on what to do my mom throught my life hadnt been the best to me or my siblings shes mostly just yelled at us for small things and have said things like i should just put you in foster care or another exaple from just today im about to start swinging meaning she was threatening to hit my sister who is becuase she wasnt getting ready fast enough ive had to deal with things like this for as far back as i remember its gone through ups and downs mostly during lockdown and one of the worst ones being in late august now this is here i might need some advice even in moments like that she always ends up being really nice and often times acts like it didnt happen afterwards it ends up really playing with my emotions and i dont know how to feel about her i dont like being around her and sometimes i am scared of her but at the same time she can be really nice and a good mother i just really dont know what i should think or do at this point its been like this as long as i can remember
so idk if you should call this abuse but i think it is but my dad told me back in march of that he was gonna use a gag ball on me if i didnt shut up keep in mind i have adhd it was pm and my meds were wearing off and i wouldnt stop talking i told my mom about it when it happened and she was mad but is that a form of abuse
i f reported my parents for physical abuse and neglect against my brothers and i had a lot of evidence including texts between my parents where they talk about hitting them i have videos of my dad being very verbally aggressive towards them they already had another report filed on their behalf by my sisters therapist i got this text today saying they closed the case ive heard this usually means they arent going to do anything because they have to keep the case open while they are taking any action against them my dad is very physically abusive and in my case he smashed my face picked me up and threw me against the wall and broke my nose at the height of my abuse i have seen him be physically violent towards my brothers many times though not to the same extent i am worried about them and their safety i dont know what more i can do because i cant return home for my own safety i have also been primarily taking care of them and i do not feel my parents are capable of giving them the care and security they need i miss them a lot any ideas of what i can do either for myself or my brothers
how do i get my mum to stop drinking profusley for reference my mum has been drinking since i was young and would beat me occasionally and verbally abuse me often for this reason i flew to another country to leave my mother and my life behind when i was to live with relatives years later i moved back in with her thinking that she had changed yet less than a year later i am back to getting beaten more and more and her saying stuff like i wish i got an abortion and i wish you never came back she gets heavily drunk every night and always looks for something to yell at me for i do everything around the house from washing to taking my siblings to school and cooking every night but she will always find a way to yell at me it will start with her saying something sarcastic then when i ignore her she will push further and further untill i just snap at her then she will go on about how lucky i am to be under her roof and how she could send me to my father at anytime i have never met my father or had intrest in it and then when i say something back it will escelate to her saying she will kill my pets and drown them in a bucket i cant stop her from doing it and i feel if it goes on any longer i might do something i might regret any advice on how to deal with it update so yesterday morning i woke up and as it was the easter weekend so everyone is home i am having a wonderful day until my mother tries to talk to me she is slurring words and i can tell she is heavily drunk but i am confused as it was only am anyways she starts yelling at me for all of the stuff that i in her eyes do wrong and i have learnt not to argue but she meantions selling or killing my pets once again this has tipped me over the edge and i yell back she pretends to be shocked like how could i yell at the person who raised m she raised me till i was and then locks me outside the house now i have had enough of her shit so i call my nan her mum and i tell her whats going on and my mum walks out and she loses her shit at me for context she has not had any form of contact in over years so she does not like seeing her son have an actual relationship with his family anyways so she cracks her shit at me and rips the phone out of my hand and smashes it on the ground going on times its in half at this point and she has gotten so worked up that she decided she wanted to hurt me so she picked up a spirits bottle and thows it straight at my face it bounces off and smashes all over the ground she then procedes to pick up a wine bottle and then pelt that at me this time smashing all over me and leaving me soaking and with cuts over me she then goes inside and smashes my pc which i custom made with some savings i had i have no phone no pc and she has turned the internet off my only hope was to walk about km into town and get a payphone there i call my nan and tell her whats happened after she smashed my phone and we sort some stuff out i should sometime in the near future be catching a flight back to my nans house and spending the rest of my childhood safe i have no empathy for my mum anymore i started this thread saying i cared and wanted to help her now i see its useless and if she wants to drink herself to the grave idfc she has no more family left no more friends left and hopefully soon no money
ive only told this story to those that are close to me growing up it wad mainly my mother older sisteryr older and little brother who was autistic and non verbal mths younger and me my little brother figured out how to regurgitatethrow up when ever he wanted basically i was about at the time and my mother took us to do laundry me and big sis begged her not to buy lil bro mcdonalds in fear that he would vomit in the car she brought him his food saying she would be quick and had the three of us sit in the car while she did laundry so and behold lil bro gets bored and pukes i let my older sister know so she can tell our mother big sis gets out goes into the laundry mat and comes out fine mom comes out of the laundry mat angry opens to he back door and starts slapping me around grabbing my hair and yelling she then had me take off my clothes to clean the mess my little brother made she would not allow me to get clean clothes from the bags of laundry and hate me sit in the car naked beat up and snotty when we got home the boys who lived on the block were playing basketball at the house across the street from ours my mother tried to make me get out the car naked in front of them i refused so she slapped me a few more times grabbed me by the hair and hit my head against the car door a few times then kind of shoved me back into the car and closed the door she got my brother out of his side and had my big sister who looked terrified help her bring the clothes in and left me there i stayed hidden in the back seat because i was nude and my face arms and legs hurt and i all honestly i was embarrassed and confused right before it got dark and hours before our dad came home she allowed me sister to bring out a small jacket to come inside i was more releived that the boys were gone i have a lot of memories like this and i still loved her sorry for the long read or if i triggered anything thank you for those who stayed and strolled down memory lane with me
so i know this may not truly qualify as abusive parents but i couldnt post anywhere else so yeah for context im ive had screen time limits since i was but at age they got worse basically making it so i can never use my phone i am forced to request screen time even though im because my parents still havent disabled the screen time or given me the password so the reason im posting this is to get peoples opinion on the topic
when i lived in jordan with my really abusive dad and normal mom the best way to get what i wanted was lie it was so easy and i had to do it i needed to lie so much so often for so many things now after we ran away we live with my moms uncle wich is sadly also abusive but i grew up and wont let him get to me but thats beside the point i cant stop lying to him about things and the lies are always bad because they just come out i cant even think so he always knows im lying and i get punished it feels like living with my dad made me lie and i hate it
i hope you all read this because i really need some advice hello everyone i am an yo boy i am from europe i live with my parents and younger brother and we dont live in our country but in a foreign one i have never complained online but now i really dont know what should i do to get to the point my mum doesnt let me go out but only when she sends me to the market which is minutes away from home if i talk with a girl on social media she start yelling at me and says why do you talk with that girl do you want me to call that girl if my mum goes out she doesnt let me stay alone at home starts yelling untill i eventually give up and go with her and manipulates everybody to give some context from to i went out only two times and that was in front of our home when i got to highschool things got different a little bit she would drive and take me from highschool but when her car got damaged i went with bus and thats where i had a bit of freedom in may i asked my mum if i could go out with some school mates and a girl and she agreed but she sent my father to watch me what i would do it was a bit frustrating but i enjoyed the time out few days later my mum controlled my phone secretly and checked the texts between me and the girl i went out with and her social media and my mum saw that the girl was a bit depressed had a few tattoos mediumshort hair and a few earrings thats when my mum started to manipulate the situation my mum reacted by saying that she was in shock because i talk with a depressive punk girl like that and then she told everybody aunts uncles my mums parents that i was part of a vicious cycle which it was not true but my grandparents and everyone else believed her from that moment my mum told me that i wont go to that school anymore but because it was almost the end of the school year she lets me finish there in the summer of my mum let me go around our little city with the bike at the end of august i tried to smoke my sister caught me smelling of cigarettes and told to my mum when my mum asked me about it i didnt lie and told her that i did try a cigarette after this event in september she took me out of school and didnt let me go out but only to the market i tried to go to school in september untill she did the paperwork for taking me out of school but she didnt let me at the time i couldnt do anything because i was a minor so i talked with one of my aunt this happened still on around october and she advised me that i should convince my mum to enroll me in highschool and if my mum wouldnt enroll me in highschool i should wait until i am and then enroll me by myself to highschool my birthday is on th december and from september from december i only went out when my mum would send me to the supermarket or eventually when she went to the supermarket a few months before my th birthday i started to talk to my uncles about everything that happened and i told them to help me to go in my country and stay to my grandparents my mums parents so i can go to school and they agreed to help me my mum found out that my uncles her brothers would help me and she lied about the fact that she took me out of school and convinced them that i didnt went to school because i didnt want to after some contradictory discussions me telling my uncles that is not true what my mum says and my mum telling them that i lie my uncles said that they wont help me anymore after my birthday i decided to talk to my grandpa my mums father i told him the same things that i told to my uncles plus that she doesnt let me go out and he said that first he wants to talk to my mum and secondly that i have to come to an agreement with my mum my mum talked with him and said that she want to go in our country and there is no sense in me going alone a week before then about the school she lied again in a lot of ways firstly she said that i was going to school then when she saw that my grandpa didnt believe her lied and said that i didnt went to school because i didnt want to which is not true the about not letting me out my mum said that she lets me out which is not true fast forward my grandpa said that if my mum says that she will go in our country for christmas holidays to wait and come with her we went for holidays in our country and there we all had long discussions with my grandpa my mums father i told him that my mum took me out of school since september my mum would contradict me and say that i lie and that i went to school my grandpa believed me after he asked to see my report card which my mum didnt have because i didnt go to school thats when my mum started to put everyone against me she said that i didnt went to school because i didnt want to and that then she actually took me out of that school because she wanted to put me in another school because i smoked and i was part of a group of all punk girls and boys that were doing drugs and stuff like this but it was not true from that moment everybody started to doubt what i say except my grandpa my grandpa said that she must enroll me back to school i wanted to remain to school in my country with my grandparents but my mum lied that i cant remain there because my school transfer paper was not valid we eventually come to an agreement with the help of my grandpa in which my mum lets me go out normally and enroll me back to a private school in the foreign country so i can recuperate the lost years of highschool thats what i did even if i didnt want tomy mum enrolled me to a private school kilometers miles away where i can recuperate the lost years of school but now here back in the foreign country my mum again doesnt let me out not even for a walk i go out only when she sends me to the market or when i get my monthly haircut whenever i ask her why doesnt she let me out she answer with who said that i dont let you go out are you insane i let you go out but you dont want to go out and thats what she says to everyone else but when i tell her that i wanna go out she says no where do you go if you go out you dont come back no you dont go out because you go to search drugs i never touched drugs i never talked with people who dodid drugs and never will now my mum sometimes says that she wont pay my private school and to go wherever i want or to go to work to pay my school and stuff like this but when i am looking for a job and eventually have to meet for the interview she tells me not to go because we will leave the town and go in the town where i have school or on the day i have the meeting she takes me out of town with her because she have stuff to do but actually she only goes to shopping and again if i want to stay at home while she goes i cant she starts yelling untill i eventually give up my grandpa told me to wait untill the school year ends which is in june so we can see what happens but based on what my mum says and the fact that she doesnt let me out mostly always staying between walls is not that nice so what do i do edit my mum took me out of highschool after i finished the first year of highschooljune now the only reason i came back in this foreign country is because my mum said that she will enroll me in a private school where i would recuperate the lost years of highschool she enrolled me in a prive school a month ago but i am not going physically to the private school because its kilometers away miles now sometimes she says that she wont pay the private school anymore and other times she says that she will pay it if she doesnt pay the private school i wont recuperate the missed years of highschool
putting this on a burner so my boyfriend doesnt see it and get worried i m have been dealing with incredibly abusive parents for a long time i am currently months away from moving out to go live with my grandmother and biological dad yesterday when coming home from school i encountered a small brown bag on our doorstep it had no labels and seemed to be empty and as someone who tries to pick up trash i shoved it into my pocket and went downstairs when i took it out just to be safe i shook the bag and a small baggy of substance plopped onto my counter i immediately texted my best friend who was around this kind of thing for a while due to her ex boyfriend and she confirmed it was a illegal drug in my area and it was twice the normal dose i hid it in my run away bag a bag that my grandma insisted i pack with important documents and other things and started to freak out my family has a doorbell cam and my step mother who was the one who the drugs belonged to called me and asked me if id picked up a bag i laughed it off as id thrown it in my bin because it was just a brown bag but now i just dont know what to do i have photo evidence of the drug but i dont nt know if this would affect my graduation and if i should just stay quiet until i leave or not this has been where all the money to buy me and my brother food for has been going and even though i hate my mom and step mom i can barely even look at them bow
my mom has been an alcoholic abusive narcissist ever since i can remember ive lived with her alone along with my sister since i was she gained a bf and he moved in when i was around they have an abusive relationship and constantly kept my sister and i awake at night fighting and blaming us basically for the fights cops have been to my house multiple times but they ended up always defending each other i was the peace maker of the house and i basically faked my relationship with my mom throughout high school so my mental health didnt suffer more and my social life wasnt taken from me i finally had the guts to move out after high school i bounced around houses because there was no where i could really stay for a while on end my mom continued to contact me through this time but i never responded i moved across the country in november to get away from her and live on a mountain she currently still contacts me and manipulates me i do know that she loves me so much but its toxic and she doesnt want to live her own life she wants to live through me and wants me to do what she wants i really dont know what to do anymore and i cant seem to let her go fully but in the end i really dont want a relationship with her or her bf but theres some part of me thating feels bad for that so ill still text occasionally even tho i hate it because shell send me care packages every now and then so i know she cares but not enough to actually change herself i really dont know if i should just drop her completely or just ghost her like i normally do i really dont know what to do but something needs to chnage and i just dont know what to do

this may not be a coherent story im just writing down whatever i can remember whenever i can about me i f live with my parents i have a sibling who lives abroad i am also an athlete i have been homeschooled my entire life nd grade to senior year and continue to be during my university years as well this means i am always kept at home with no connect to the outside world other than my phone i apologise for the format im typing this on my phone and quickly background my pov what i was told i was pretty much an unwanted child my mother realised my dad was a whole lie after they got married had a kid nevertheless and it cemeted the fact they never wanted another i was the kid after my mom terminated a fetus as well so i am purely alive due to familial pressure in the beginning i guess my mother didnt outwardly hate me so much my father has never cared about me and didnt even come see me till i was about a year old he used to travel abroad for work it all went to shit when i turned when i was put into my sport to learn and everyone around us kept telling i was talented it didnt end well for me every day since i got beat up and compared to my sibling you see my sibling was the one who had passion about that sport not me but everyone told my parents that i had more talent and a future than she did i hated this i felt sorry not in a pity way but i hated that everyone had put so much pressure on them to prove people wrong all of this affected my relationship with both my parents and my sibling i was abused by some of my coaches many times hit slapped made to do so much extra workouts insulted and had my character questioned mind you i was at the time i was nearly drowned in the name of punishment had my fingers bent backwards etc mind you this was normal in our country and region my parents never stepped in to stop this they stepped in when the same thing happened to my sibling once but not me only when they started using them as insults towards me which ended up hurting their ego and image did they step in so they stopped it my parents just took me home and continued to do what the coaches used to do in addition to whatever they used to do as well more than half the time i was covered in bruises in areas where it wont be outwardly visible ribs stomach head etc over the years ive developed a severe fear and dislike of physical contact solely because of this the only times my parents sibling or coaches ever touched me was to hit me the only times i was never yelled at hit or told i should diewas when they used to send me off to my grandparents so that i wont bother them my extended family knows about all of this they never said anything they tried once long ago they didnt let my grandparents see me for nearly half a year they never asked again over the years ive become a near carbon copy of my parents especially my father i look near exactly like him have his personality apparently hes never cared about the family in general so when people look at me they only see an extension of him so my mother who despises him treats me how she wishes she treated him so ive been hit with hot metal utensils had hot food thrown at me metal plates to eat with thrown etc through all of this i oddly enough happened to win a couple of state and national trophies in my name in my sport one coach saw the potential i had in me and pushed me to do better and was more of a father figure to me than anyone else my mother broke all of my trophies once when she was yelling at me as punishment im also not allowed to try and fix it even with tape to serve as a reminder of my mistake the mistake being i lost a couple of gold medals to another athlete but qualified for the higher competition nonetheless through all of this my parents also used to give me hell in front of my sibling just to make them feel better mind you they werent useless at all they actually got to a higher position in the sport than i did but my parents still continue to say that ill never be like them both my parents hate each other they see each other when thry look at me so both of them dont treat me right i have a very monotone way of speaking naturally i also speak in mix of british and american english solely because i learned to speak and talk via watching movies and tv shows instead of my parents trying to teach me my parents havr tried to cut my throat once for the way i speak the dead sounding tone so i learned to fake the times when i speak to people although im not very good at it even something simple as oh i dont want that comes off as blunt and harsh i picked up in sarcasm as a method to avoid answering questions when the few friends i had realised i had bruises and was in pain almost all the time over the years i finally gave up on trying to earn their love and respect so it just ended up as me looking like a terrible human being to everyone i got bitter during my peak teenage years and lashed out occasionally i admit i am a bit of a trashy human being im still learning to let go i have a few friends now after they fought with my parents to still be friends with me they are the only ones who see the real me and are the only people ive ever told this to they call me out on my bs but all of them including their parents understand why im snappy and sarcastic sometimes there have been times when my parents sent me off to practice with no food in my system so the used to give me some of their snacks before it started so that i wont faint these people and my cats are the only reasons why i havent ended it yet i have considered i used to self harm to cope with my life but yeah i cant really write as i never developed the skills so maybe i could have put this better to make it more accurate sounding but i dont know this is all i can remember at the moment i may sound like im just complaining and if that is what you feel it is i accept the judgement i just needed a place to vent that my parents and sibling will never find
when i was a young kid around years old i didnt know it then but i had severe depression and ptsd from my parents very messy divorce where they used me as ammo in the courts which lasted until i was there where two times that i can remember where i went comatose for hrs no one was able to wake me so my father left me there to sleep for two days my little body could t handle the mental stress of the being used like that and living in a different home every week where i was constantly manipulated into saying something that they could use against each other in court amongst many other similar things as i grew older around years old it happened again to me where i slept through my alarm for school so my father had the best idea he grabbed the biggest pot he could find from the kitchen and filled it with ice cold water he came to my room and slowly pours the pot out onto my face and head completely soaking me my bed blankets and pillows i shot up in shock choking on the water as it was poured into my open mouth aswell as on everything else i watched him lightheartedly say you need to get up when i tell you to and not miss your alarm or the discipline will be more severe next time as he walked out of my room i made it to school min late first class hadnt even started yet they day ends and i come home to find my bed and everything else hasnt dried in the slightest so end up having to sleep in a cold soaking wet bed with cold wet pillows and blankets they would not last me sleep anywhere else except my bed because i was being dramatic now get this next day rolls around and it fucking happens to me again where i slept through both of my alarm clocks and im dead to the world in a soaking wet bed and this mofo comes in with another pot of water except this time my head was faced towards the wall so my ear was facing directly up and as you can guess thats exactly where it was poured first from a height it hit me square in the ear and almost blew my ear drum out from the pressure fast forward years and he is on his deathbed and has somehow found my address i moved across the country and went no contact as soon as turned he is asking me to atleast respond to his letter since he is not long for this side of the river in his words and that he dosnt think i should not talk to him because of his issues with my mother in the past i am beyond livid that he could so blatantly disregard all the other reasons why i would ever want to never to all to him again i understand why people like him only half truths to make them sound better but goddam i want to burn his house down and watch the light leave his eyes sry if you the story came off pretty choppy it was pretty difficult to put this in words not bring up the other details that made this even worse then what ive written down thx for taking the time to read this if you have made it this far i just needed to get this off my chest hope yall have a good rest of your day
for context me and my parents are all neurodivergent and have trouble expressing our emotions in a healthy way also both of my sisters have since moved out so im left without a mediator im not great at waking up for school in the mornings and usually end up waking up late i set my alarms and my parents try to help wake me up too by calling me through the echo dot in my room but i just kept falling asleep this morning its am now i have to leave in less than minutes my mom noticed and was not happy she stormed down to my room and opened the door ripped the blankets off me picked up the full water bottle on my nightstand and dumped it all on me not only did it get on me but everything around me including the new book i just got i was pretty shocked both of my parents especially my mom has a history of taking her anger out on me ive been spanked many more times than both of my sisters combined ive been slapped screamed at had my hair pulled had things thrown at me and been threatened so many times also ive been grounded from all possible electronics even as simple as an mp player for weeks at a time there have been times that theyve thrown andor hid away foods because my arfid gives me many problems when it comes to eating dinner why do i get these punishments sometimes i dont know it could be for having a bad attitude poor time management talking back or as i like to call it having conversations or speaking my mind or whatever i know that they love me and want the best for me but i dont think they have ever treated my sisters this way i understand that i am more stubborn and mentally challenged but this is getting outrageous i dont feel safe at home even though i have it way better than most kids its made my mental health worse and i cant stand it anymore
i know im young im turning in weeks from now i live with my grandparents my na n gives me no privacy at all and forces me to go to bed at sometimes earlier she blames every argument on me and treats my sister better than me im suffering from deppression and sh at the moment but neither of my grandparents helped i found cp on my grandads phone and hes always creepy toward me my nan takes my phone away from me which keep in mind she didnt purchase so it is entirely my property im a part of the lgbtq community and i came out to her several times but she still pressures me to get with a man and makes jokes that are uncomfortable to me im not allowed to buy anything or even leave the house not allowed any food without asking first sometimes they hit me but not often sorry for the long vent is this abuse or just being strict
man i dont understand physics and how the hell should i concentrate on understanding it like this she herself doesnt understand shit because she never got to have a high education and now just belittles me every time and calls me stupid
on bad terms with both parents recently went through a miscarriage while in a fight with my dad he teased me for it i havent spoken to him for months today i spoke to my mom for the first time in a year last time we talked i called the cops on her for animal cruelty i was subpoenaed to testify against her in court with my brother when we saw her she gave me a hug we talked for a while even though it was uncomfortable it made me emotional because that hug felt like the last hug ill ever give her im obviously not going into a whole lot of detail but never in my life did i think i would give her one more hug she told me to keep in touch but with her past record of threats and pure hatred for motherhood i wont let it happen my parents are alive and mostly well but there is nobody on earth who could say anything more hateful than the words of my mother and father i mourn the relationship i wanted with them im so broken i love them but i mourn them every single day im no longer damaging my mental health for trash treatment
how do you handle tramaversary i have psychological non epileptic seizures due to trama and the last few days have been kicking my az
i was born in la and my dad i know this from what my mom told me was a drug addict and hit her but she didnt leave for me and my sisters sake when i was my dad went to jordan to visit his parents he was supposed to come back but for some reason they decided it was better to live there so for the next years i lived with my abusive grandparents and dad then my dad went to jail a couple times and then he started drinking instead of drugs since it was legal he would hit us yell at us and then he would start crying to make us feel bad and wed comfort him one time he slaped me in a store multiple times then threw me down some stairs and then he started crying and i had to comfort him my mom finally came to her senses and left him while planning how to take us back to the usa we eventually managed to run away to florida but it wasnt over we moved in with my moms uncle wich was supposedly a nice guy but no hes still abusive much less than my dad but still enough to make me not want to go home and this is especially bad since for years we thought wed get at least a normal life when we go to america and i keep thinking of how even one small thing like me having a normal dad wouldve given me an infinitely better life with some simple changes i couldnt lived a happy life instead of crying myself to sleep every night
im and i still cant live on my own yet but right after i turned my parents started acting like theyre actually changing and its making me upset and frustrated like theyre only doing this to keep me in their lives because im no longer legally required to be they say theyre worried about my and my siblings futures but theyve done so much damage when we needed them most i dont want to forgive and forget and just move on but not only do i feel guilty from them being like you have to work with uswere trying to speak to you like an adult but also that other ppl have said that all thats being asked of parents is to try i gave them so many chances im just tired of living in unpredictability and honestly dont know if the relationship can even be saved they werent the worst out there but what they did hurt a lot and sticks with me all they have to say is im sorry if what we did in childhood traumatized you usually followed up with parenting is something you learn along the way that doesnt mean i needed to be abused though i just i want to know if im wrong for any of this wanting to cut them off asapfeeling like theyre abusive kind of stuff i feel like them going its just your perspective trips me up sometimes like maybe it didnt happen
so many people dont know my secret about my parents i live in an orthodox jewish community where everyone knows each other and if i write the truth about my parents in my book it will be bad for them but they are sometimes ok and sometimes very ok but other times they are terrible they unlock my wheelchair so i cant move trapping me they call me names left and right they think ill never accomplish my dreams they are so negative i hate them but then other times they do little things like bring back food from a restaurant for me or spend a little time with me rare and i think they cant be all bad they have broken me beyond words i dont even know where to start but to sum it up they are emotionally abusive and neglectful so much i do not know where to start i want so badly to write my story but i am still living at home in this toxic atmosphere im btw and i am severely disabled in a wheelchair with various medical equipment i have full time nurses that take care of me way better than parents my condition does not affect my brain im regular except depressed on meds because of my toxic living atmosphere i have a job and its my only reprieve advice wanted or if i can help anyone not feel alone too by saying yes this is happening to me too then good i didnt even begin to describe the pain its the tip of the iceberg
my sister around her sophomore of high school showed my fathers same pathologicalannihilative envy its pretty clear hes extremely jealous of me and has been for a long time even going so far to sabotage me as to steal of my college fund so i couldnt get further schooling avoidance of your abilities trying to forget you exist literally uncle vernon style even gets the beet red face and missing all my important milestones on purpose growing up makes it pretty clear at first when i was growing up i thought my sister wouldnt be like him but then she started a disturbing trend of getting jealous of the class above hers valedictorian and started acting like her doing everything she did smiling like hereventually not only did she also have to be valedictorian and take all the exact same subjects but she even ended up marrying her exboyfriend like there is jealousy and then there is something a little more disturbing thats still based in jealousy she has done the same things to me like when i got into a software engineering school she went into the next room and starting coding with r for literally no reason other than to take the focus away from me getting in she also asked my grandfather who was prettier and clearly was expecting to hear herself and when she heard me she hasnt been able to let go of it since and looks like she might have sicked her whole husbands family on me even though i dont talk to anyone just to get back at me out of a response i had no control over again i dont talk to literally any of them nor want to but they all show signs of her trying to use them to fix that clearly extreme narcissistic injury finally its just gotten over the top where shes been doing work in my major and trying to give me her old phones and avoid whats going on with my father because it suits her sabotaging goals like there is jealousy and there is next level jealousy i really thought my sister would be different but she is next level jealous like my father is so its clearly genetic i literally do not feel jealousy i feel injustice but i tend to have more of a fawnadmire response when someone is clearly way better than me in some way these definitely have an annihilateignore even murder response that is clearly genetic is there any literature on this kind of thing my sister thinks my marriage was about her and refused to admit i got engaged she literally told my aunt i got married to compete with her even though it was two years after her marriage and i had been engaged to someone else long before she was even engagedi just hadnt told her becauseironicallyi didnt want her to get jealous and feel like i hadnt waited my turn because she can be like that nevertheless that one broke off and years later and two years later after her wedding i would get married none of it had anything to do with her i just had attended her wedding and was seeing if she would attend mine when it happenedfrom her response i could guess at the rest of my familys response she wouldnt even acknowledge i had said it i mean really thats kind of next level fcked up but from what she told my aunt its clear that she definitely heard it now that i work for my current boss it seems like what he would say is she ignored me because thats why she got married to make me jealous he says to avoid that kind of person who doesnt believe things or doesnt do things because they themselves wouldnt do it that never crossed my mind i was so happy to be at the wedding i was dancing and excited and having fun it never even crossed my mind to be jealous and all my friends from high school who were there will say that now im wondering if thats what she was hoping for thats disgusting i thought since she had gotten married she could now be happy for me in a new marriage that was more in time with things but nope she literally would completely avoid the topic like literally pretend she didnt hear she also tries to give me her hand me downs despite this is disgusting for a grown adult woman to gift another grown adult woman with their own jobs and she clearly enjoys hearing when i go through abuse or have periods of poverty she seems seriously sick and shes just like my dad in this way to the extremely aggressive ways they will show extreme envy there is taking some of the person youre envious ofs characteristics and resources and then there is full out denial taking everything about you to do with them not giving you anything and trying to become or destroy you like this is not normal very scary and clearly genetic because they both act like this its one thing to be jealous its another to clearly have pretty much murderous envy can someone please explain this in family i keep looking up filicide siblicide but nothing is making this make sense i literally do not have this gene all i have is what my grandfather said is that i seem like im actually italian and she seems more polish and my grandmother has a lot of the same envy problems to the point she would hoard tons of stuff while her family was living in poverty and when they said you know lady thats kind of effed up she would say oh theyre jealous i mean thats just narcissism and i know my sister ended up taking the fellow narcissist path in the family while i took the black sheep path but nevertheless hers is just wow over the top like it is definitely not normal to the point i have reason to believe she cant even accept im a math teacher and is even competing with me in my calculus skill even though i dont speak to her at all after i heard what she thought my marriage was about from my aunt and i was blown away by how sick in the head that was especially as i had been engaged way earlier than she had been and politely had kept it quiet so she could get married first because i know how she could be none of it had anything to do with her it was beyond disturbing to hear that from my aunt it meant she had legitimately heard and understood what i said and purposefully stonewalled and then gossiped about it later usually when i see my father doing this i think hes gone temporally intellectually disabled or something and literally isnt letting it in this proved that wrong it was beyond disturbing because it means they know what theyre doing when theyre stonewalling and purposefully do it its not a mental block again i cant emphasize how distressing and disturbing it is to have found that out about both of them my father however is not on that side of the family he has english and german genes and she acts more like him my parents admit she cant think metacognitively in the same way cant think big picture abstractly without a ton of effort as the only difference my parents say they tried to philosophize with her but she just cant really and kind of takes a cheap move to get out of it most every time ive looked into pfc deficits and murderous envy but other than psychopathy i cant find muchusually psychopaths dont have that much like obsessive annihilative envy i dont see how this factors into envy that aggressive though or what my grandfather meant when he said i seem more italian in my personality it seems way more intense than most of the narcissistic literature im reading but psychopathy doesnt fit the more envious vain feature both of them also show i have no idea what is the only thing that have resonated is content on siblicide and filicide and its extremely scary
i dont trust her to help me anymore and nobody else in life gives a shit about me so i dont have anybody else to help me either the fucked thing is that she didnt really raise me all too well so im pretty much a manchild thats very dependent on other people helping me out lol do you guys think this might be abuse

my mother and father both have habits of going through my room and snooping around to see if theres anything they can find or use against me which will eventually lead to me getting beat with the help of my older brother who no longer lives with us ive actually had the opportunity to live a little with him sending me some cash to actually have a bit of fun in my life my parents always demand for people to listen to them yet when i try to speak they dont want to so when my parents found a book they deemed demonic and confronted me about it i tried to explain but that only led to a slap in my face ive tried to hide things but they never seem to work anything would be appreciated thank you

rambling post sorry in advance without getting into it to deeply both my mom and dad divorced were emotionally abusive to me f in different flavors with my mom she is textbook narcissistic hiding a deepl damaged and vulnerable core and lashes out constantly about it ive been no contact with her and low contact at different points but after my grandfather died two years ago we got closer and i started to really worry about her her external shell really cracked and every scaffolding shed built for her life and her emotions came tumbling down since then weve had really good and really bad times and ive driven to her hours multiple times when i thought she was in a really dark place i worry about her mentally emotionally and ive had a really hard time putting boundaries back up when i know she has basically no one else in her life anymore she sends me massive long catastrophizing texts she refuses any and all suggestions of solutions or offers of help but will later say no one ever does anything for her ive been better about ignoring or not engaging with those but the problem is latelyher situation has gotten really bad shes getting evicted theres probate issues with her fathers estate she might be getting a divorce there not really anything i can do about these situations its not my life and i cant help or control it i know that even if it was possible i have zero resources or means with which to help and doing so would put a strain on my relationships and life but the problem is that i cant get rid of the worry and guilt and panic anyway especially when she tells me how awful everything is and goes back to defeatism if shes pretending its all good i can pretend and we can still have some good memories but otherwise i get consumed with this feeling any advice on how to distance myself from her problems without just giving up on the relationship entirely discussions with her will never work and im not willing at this point to go no contact again i know i know i just dont have it in me rn how do i get rid of this gnawing feeling inside
so my mother says she isnt abusive but she is abusive because how many times have my older sister called the cops because my mom hit her like its hard to explain stuff without being reported
i grew up in a very physically and emotionally abusive family i dreamed every day when i was a kid that i might somehow have been switched at birth and my real family would come save me the abuse lead to me ending up living with a sexually physically emotionally and financially abusive boyfriend for years after i became homeless as a senior in high school im now and i still struggle with the trauma from the abuse and it often presents itself whenever i am in a high conflict situation especially in a work environment my body starts shaking and i cant control it i try really hard to discuss rationally with the other person who has escalated the situation but its so embarrassing that i have no control over body when this happens im now at a job with a supervisor who takes her frustrations out on me whenever something happens between her and her boss and always tries to frame whatever happened into being somehow my fault every time she comes to my desk i have that familiar fear of what did i do wrong now even though i know ive done nothing wrong and ive done everything that shes ever asked me to do does anyone else struggle with these physical symptoms and if so what helps you
ive been stuck here for years with no help at all then my mother finally allowed me to go see my older sister which is in a different province ive never felt so happy in my life ive been getting abused by my mother she threatens me hits me and always swears at me my father is sexual towards me i cant seek help at all my mom told me i cant open up to my own sister shell take me away from them i just wanna run and never come back mind you i just turned i cant even tell my cousinbestie about it shes always wanting to facetime but theres to much bruises on my face
this is a massive brain dump on a few things we have going on in the house that i constantly put a fight up about because in my eyes its wrong and not fair im just looking to hear other opinions im years old and have been a career for my dad since i was years old when i moved in with him since that age ive looked after myself mainly cooking my own meals being in charge of houses cleanliness washings getting myself ready for school etc so my family dynamic isnt the usual one my father leaves mess everywhere and im not joking clutter dishes food big bags absolutely everything we live in a bedroom town house so its large and its on me and only me to clean this i can gut the house bare in mind ive been doing this since i was years old and then go to schoolwork and come home to a mountain of mess because hes decided he wanted to cook for himself or he has pulled stuff out of cupboards and just leaves it expecting me to clean it this happening everyday is exhausting and because of it i never had a childhood i have spoke to him about it multiple times over the years and it results in an argument and him saying that its his mental health but he can easily get up and do things that suit him while leaving the mess for me surely this isnt normal to add to that recently i have been going through a diet change so it means i meal prep on a sunday and that does my food for the week my dad cooks his own food however every time he cooks his food he will shout me to come clean his mess and its not got anything to do with me so every night im cleaning the kitchen after hes cooked his meals and then he leaves his plate for me to get as well my dad is also of the opinion that his word is law and due to the hierarchy of the way society is set i have to do what he says when he says now i understand you need to do what your parents tell you to do but this man is riddled with ptsd anxiety short term memory loss and he changes his mood and mind every mins so from a very young age i havent ever been confident in his parenting abilities he is also of the opinion that during an argumentdebate im not allowed to share my opinion have an opinion or go against his beliefs he also has said to me before you should be grateful because as a parent i dont need to like you accept you or let you live here yet i do his views on the world really scare me he constantly is manipulating and gas lighting me in every single situation its so bad that i cant even have a normal conversation about my work because he will put in his own way of how i need to handle something and i explain back that i cant do that and he gets angry and starts an argument then blames it on me says im not good for his mental health and i get called all the names under the sun he used to try convince me i needed therapy because i had multiple issues and that i had an eating disorder which isnt true i used to struggle to eat beacuse i was under stress and anxiety living under his roof he did convince me to go and when i went to therapy the woman genuinely asked me why i was here because the only reason it sounds like im here is because my dad told me to and there isnt anything wrong to be fixed with me when i told my dad that he told me i needed a new therapist its just all getting a bit much he been dealing with this for years and the older i get the worse it is as i now notice a lot of things i just need someone to read this and tell me that none of that is normal and i have a right to hate my father
my sister is being constantly abused by mother she manipulates gaslight threatens practically everything in the book of being an abusive piece of shit i come from an indian family so she threatens my sister with marriage a lot and i need help since my mother said she will marry her off once she turns my sister cant become independent as she doesnt have a proper stable job yet and my parents are pretty much confining her to the house and is constantly isolating all her choices of becoming independent if my sister runs away from the house my mother will kill herself i asked other people on what to do but all of them keep saying just let her marry but thats just like letting my mother ruin her life more my sister literally cried how her life is already so destroyed that theres no point in doing anything shes also scared of the abuse towards me going even worse but i told her that im fine with it and i can handle it im more worried about her since she has so much pressure from my parents as she is one of the most important finanical support in the family so i doubt they will just let her go so easily and become indepedent my dad is a not good person to ask help as he is an enabler and always makes my mom angry and she takes it out on my sister i do plan on somehow getting a part time job but im still a minor and here we need permission from parents to get a job and they are pretty much refusing any chance of me getting a job before college please give me help i dont want her life to be over

im finding it really hard to deal with my moms constant tantrums and emotional manipulation i flinch and tense up when she comes into my room cause any conversation could end up with her throwing a tantrum berating and insulting me making me feel like shit and refusing to leave how do i manage to avoid this happening cause no matter how hard i try and avoid touchy subjects she somehow finds a way to make me feel like shit
i want to start off by saying that this is less of aita and more of me looking for validation and advice i f and my mom f have been fighting constantly for around three years which is around the same time my father lost custody of me my mother always initiates fights with me over the most randomridiculous things due to my ptsd from my father trying to unalive my mother in front of me multiple times i had severe attachment issues with my mother looking back i realized that my mother liked the fact that i had these issues because she could easily control me unfortunately this made it a very hard transition into middle school where i was often bullied for my home life i used to be so confused about the sudden resentmentemotional manipulating and gaslighting so much so that i would silently cry on the floor of my bathroom or in a corner of my room eventually i began to detach more from my mom and develop new relationships unfortunately since i had no real idea what a healthy relationship was i became friends with people who looking back where definitely not the best friendships im not going to get too deep into some of the fights we have gotten into because i fear that somehow someone will identify me but im just gonna say that she would exhibit very phycotic behavior while know one else was around i also feel very separate from the rest of the family since i have a half sister who is years younger than me who will continue to have a completely different childhood than me when i was her age we where in the lower income bracket moving from apartment to apartment and from boyfriends house to boyfriends house there was also a period of time i lived with my grandmother i also watched my dad pass out on the couch from illegal substances and i watched him get arrested to many times to count meanwhile she goes to target to get barbie dolls multiple times a week and gets everything she could ever ask for then my mom will say stuff like oh you where the same way her age or when i will mention we have different experiences she will say only with your father which makes me very upset because yes my father is not a good person and a horrible father but she has done so many damaging things over the years that go unmentionedi also constantly have to baby sit her without being paid or having any validation for the hours i spend being an extra parent to her i do so much with our any recognition i love my sister its not about her its about them now that it is a two parent household i feel that i should not have to parent her the way i do especially with zero validationpayment ive tried to set so many boundaries with them but my mom called be entitled and screamed at me to go to my room she also took off my doorknob for multiple months and constantly goes through my phone as she has made it clear that there is no privacy in this house she has also told me multiple times not to tell my school counselor about stuff at home and she constantly makes stuff up to strangers my mom also makes it very known that being with my father was a huge mistake and says things like i learned my lesson and will make it very known that i was unplanned and will go into detail talking about the multiple different forms of protection that they used she told me that she tried being with him for about months after i was born but just couldnt manage it she also will put up a huge k for the rest of the family last name it really upset me when i was a bit younger so i asked if she could add an s for me or move it into another room that i dont really go into much because my mom turned it in to a play room for my sister which by the way used to be a dining room that was in my mind when i was younger a symbol of what a normal family had which my mom was very aware of anyway she never moved nor got an s for my last name and just pretty much ignored my request when i finally made friends with people who i felt very connected with she constantly called them names like stupididiotbitchetc she often imply a that having me as a daughter is super hard and that shes practically an angel for putting up with me the thing is im a pretty good kid i get as and bs ive never vaped tried alcohol or any illegal substances and ive never had sx before at this point ive fully accepted the fact that our relationship wont be better and im not even sad anymore im just tired and confused and dont know what to doanything sers her off and we fight multiple times a day she tells me to go away or be quiet multiple times a day but when i leave her alone she tells me im not an active member of the family and i need to talk to her more i dont like talking to because it often leads to an argument or her rolling her eyes and telling me shes busy the only time she really talks to me is to yell at me on top of this my father recently started reaching out to me which made my relationship with my mom worse since even though she wont admit it she is visibly upset that i responded to him im not saying i want a relationship with him at all hes not a good person but also as a yr old im very confused about everything and the way she treats me makes me want to reach out to him at the same time he has admitted to unaliving someone before and getting away with it and he was also in a gang and has a lot of substance abuse issues his current wife also expresses her extreme dislike for me and has told me multiple times that she doesnt like me he also lives in hawaii and i live in new jersey and have not seen him in over three years there is so much more but its a lot if anyone wants me to post any update or answer any questions i can again im not looking for advice to reconcile with my mom since honestly i dont think i can forgive herlook past everything shes done but instead for some advice on how to deal with the next years also i do online school for this year just for some background info anyway sorry this is so long and for this being so scattered due too my add
