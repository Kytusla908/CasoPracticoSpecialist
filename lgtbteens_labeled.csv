okay for a little backstory ive known im nonbinary for about years now ive been out to my parents for over a year when i came out i said i would like to use theythem pronouns they do really good at calling me my name but neglect my pronouns and when i try and ask my mother to use theythem she gets all defensive because she is certain i dont use them so i just stopped asking her because i dont want to get yelled at but its causing me really bad dysphoria and i dont know how to tell her does anyone have any tips about this,Neutral
so im a lesbian ive been coming out for the past years what i mean by that is my mom is semi homophobic she doesnt likeagree with anyone not cis straight but she wont bully people about it and when i try to tell her that i dont like guys at all or that i like girls shell either completely ignore me or shell say that social media is pushing me to be that way and im not actually that way aka shes in complete denial about it so ive told her multiple times since every time i mention it though i feel super bad afterwards i feel like an idiot for saying it out loud im not ashamed at all to be in the lgbtq community i love the fact that im a lesbian so i dont know why i feel ashamed when i say it out loud has anyone else experienced this after coming out,Neutral
i am bi but nobody knows it even im still really figuring it out but i really want to talk to someone about it but im terrified to tell anyone because all my family and friends are christians and i dont know who is going to be accepting of me my parents are really homophobic so i know i cant tell them not yet anyway but now i have to put up with their homophobic shit and i need someone to vent to but i cant tell anyone so i came here to vent thats all thank you for listening,Neutral
hey so im and attempting to write a murder mystery story with a gay nonbinary main character as someone who isnt nonbinary i would love some guidance on this part im lesbian so ive got the gay part down,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
so like obviously ive been questioning ever since i was like eleven suggesting the fact that im probably not straight thats all i know though i probably like girls but i cant tell if i like guys or if thats just heteronormative tendencies speaking i was incredibly sheltered as a kid and didnt know gay people existed until i was ten so up until that point i just thought that i was going to marry a guy one day and thats it ive had to slowly warm up to what being gay meant and now i imagine relationships with girls just as much as relationships with guys its really confusing though cause when it comes to imagining sexual situations i only imagine men but when it comes to marriage and living the rest of my life i only imagine women am i imagining men in sexual situations because its the only thing ive been shown or am i imagining women in loving domestic situations cause men scare me i didnt grow up in all that great of a household its really confusing and its kinda stopped me from dating im seventeen i havent dated my entire life ive been trying to play it off cool by telling everyone that i just dont have time for it and that i like to be independent which has a certain truth to it but its also because im terrified sorry if this paragraph is hard to read im usually more eloquent but my minds scattered and im exhausted i might edit later so sentences make more sense if someone had a similar experience to mine itd be really helpful to hear how they figured things out thanks for reading,Neutral

ello as you can see by my username th grader here not relevant whatsoever except to add that im a yo female whos probably genderfluid maybe idk lol just gonna talk about how im feeling about my sexuality and gender identity i guess p sometimes i feel like i should have a penis between my legs it doesnt have to do with my personality whether or not i have one that describes a person who generally has manly man that exudes strong bursts of masculine energy talking about stereotypes about men and how there are people who think that people who look and act this way should have ze dick between their legs but then the times where i actually go to take a shower i realize i have a body wow i havent seen this thing in ages bruh why did i think about chopping off these lumps and my hips why did i think about hormoning them away haha im exaggerating though i dont hate the fact that i have boobs and wide hips i like the way i look love it actually i guess im confident thought its only boosted by the fact i like my own body not by what people might have told me i dont remember lol but sometimes i want to feel more masculine i feel more masculine i had an epiphany a month back where i was writing a cisgirl for once ive always felt more comfortable writing guys and if i were writing a girl theyd be a projection of myself so it didnt feel uncomfortable or any different and after about k words i read back thought about what to write next and was stumpedhow do i write a girl whawait but i am one uhkinda i guess totally didnt know what to write im still gonna continue that storyi cant change her sex or anything because its supposed to be a les story so i cant make excuses and with sexuality i can say that im pan ah yes the curvature of achingly cold metal that sends shivers down my spine at the sight of it my lips glistening and red as i stare impatiently at the sadly impotent and still laying piece of metal on my kitchen stove black grease covered its expanses with a layer of charred salmon skin lying upon it i sighed i was too lazy to take the pan out to a date to the sink better luck next time or maybe demi in my whole life ive never really had a crush and i dont really know what its like to be attracted to people i probably have been attracted to someone before but im ultra aware of my feelings so maybe not base control center reporting copy report base signal was detected on our radar copy specify signal base signal detected wasah yes a t t r a c t i o n weve done it lieutenant send report up to the main console this is so fucking random im sorry to whoever reads this lol just a person who writes a lot i can say that i mightve had a crush but i really dont think so th grade in math a girl sat in front of me dark brown short hair that went to her shoulder paleish skin but anyone could tell that she had a little mexican in her blood unless they were blind metaphorically and literally big eyes long eyelashes and thin lips she was pretty as uncrushily i could say it one day she confessed to me in the middle of class like just talking to me during work and would tease me sometimes by randomly saying if we should go out or something mind you i was it was also a year ago but i wasnt comfortable at the idea of dating at that age even when a lot of other kids were doing it too young ya know still too young now but dont really give a shit right nowanyway i was incredibly nervous she gave me a note before class ended and instantly i pointed out all of the spelling mistakes but my heart pounded and i was nervous around her my best friend at the time still friends with them will explain later said that whenever i talked about them my cheeks would go all red and stuff but in the end i gave her a note before the end of class that was a fuck load of scrambledeefuck that i didnt realize until the next day and i knew because i didnt remember any of the shit i wrote and i remember going off topic a lot just know that my note ran along the lines off sorry i dont want to lead you along i wanted to become friends though i didnt know her much i wanted to get to know her a bit more and maybe become friends who knows maybe well grow closer and build something over time that leads into something else i left my phone number on the note hoping shed text or something never did whole thing blows over and its getting closer to summer may probably dont remember and i started to approach her covert glances during math whenever wed have games during pe which were rare but wed either play capture the flag or soccer the class is split into teams where we wore these knitted colored jerseys i would chase her i was super awkward around her super shy one time during a day when we played soccer im not athletic at all please kill me when im outside under the fucking sun during summer forced out of my will i would just sit on the grass on the border of the invisible perimeters and if she was from my team or the others sometimes shed go sit with her friends by me or if she came from the neighboring field suuuuuuper awkward she asks me about random questions whats your favorite pet and stuff like that the weekend comes friday i can feel the glow of nervousness and butterflies at the thought of her saturday i can still feel it the acid bubble in my stomach not the deadly kind lol but sunday it faded i was depressed at the time and that day was a really dark one im a very apathetic person and looking back i feel like the depression was something that grew because of my own apatheticness i felt very empty cold muted everything was in black and white and nothing was ever warm colored the crush cooled down completely at the time i called it the day crush because those last few events happened over days never really took notice of her again and her hellos to me down the hallway decreased looking back i never felt attracted to her she was pretty cute but i never felt attraction really it makes me wonder if feelings rubbed off or if im demisexual dont know yetbecause first i have to actually have romantic feelings for someone and that hasnt happened yet so right now im sticking with my cold metally pans im not uncomfortable at the thought of being with a guy or girl kissing them making out with them or having sex with themoh wait that last one yesbut also no if you remember im female which means that with whomever im with in the future romantically sexually or both means id be having sex with them dont get the picture yet yeah you wouldnt because i havent really even explained anything haha for some reason im uncomfortable at the thought of having sex with someone because of of my anatomy ze female sex organ vaginapussy whatever you call it i imagine it in my mind and its all fine and dandy until i remember i have one whoopdeedoo and i know that its not just because im a virgin and havent had sex before just like any other straight or gay person whos uncomfortable at the thought of being with the same or opposite gender even when they might never have been with someone before same thing with me which then makes me wonder if im trans which then makes me go and then i dont dwell on it again because i dont have any answers ah yes forgot to mention whenever i think about being with a guy i feel gay really gay super gay uber fucking gay even gayer then i dont even feel at the thought of being with a girl when i feel like being with a girl it feels right not saying that feeling gay a wrongfar from that it just feels like everythings right in the world it makes me wonder if im more sexually and romantically attracted to guys and romantically towards girls i know i said i havent been attracted to anyone yet but i meant more of an actual person im basing this off of an idea of a guy or a girl however reliable that might be to finish this off quickly im someone who doesnt feel like the labels suit me well they never quite well fit but since im hyper aware of what im feeling i always feel the need to identify it right away before dwelling on it long enough another thing i dont care about pronouns he she theydont care if someone sees me as a guy okay as a girl okay as athey lol okay i really dont care the only thing that ticks me off is how people genderfy already existing terms to fit another gender like dude it may be a personal thing but please dont call me dudette its cringey just call me dude oooooone added thing ive been homeschooled for a year now not in touch with any friends as much anymore a certainly not in any contact with humans my age anymoreso i dont know how im daring in terms of that i can only rely on the occasional wattpad picture of gays and my heart will clench dramatically wipes tear peace,Depression/Suicidal Thoughts
