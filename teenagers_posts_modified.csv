"how should i feel i was at a party a week ago, and i was standing outside for some air when a guy approached me to ask if i was alright. we chatted for a while and it got sort of deep and he asked for my snap before we went back inside. before i left, he came and walked out with me, and we’ve been messaging non stop ever since. i get attached quite easily, and i already am to him and he said he was to me as well. we fit each others types and convo just flows really easily between us and he’s also complimented me a lot. i’m seeing him again in a week with my friends, and i feel like something could maybe happen with us, but i don’t want to get ahead of myself or mistake him being platonic with something more than that. what should i do?",

"Im I in the wrong for breaking up with my girlfriend cause she changed  First of all we’ve been dating for three inconsistent years, it was all sweet in the beginning. She always listened to me cared for me and my feelings and avoided doing stuff that’ll hurt me. But in the last few months when ever we argue it seems like she doesn’t give a fuck if she was wrong, she always put the blame on me even when she’s wrong, she stopped caring about what makes me mad and jealous. Like simping for male celebrities and saying it was normal even tho she accepted not to in the past. She stopped responding immediately, stopped making me her priority like she did before, always postpone our dates for stupid reasons and for an average 3 postpones a date. and always complain about that i dont treat her very well even while she act like shit. And forgot to mention that all the effort that’s been put into the relationship was from me.  I couldn’t handle anymore, I was being patient hoping that the old her would summon but unfortunately it didn’t after all the effort I put. So I broke up with her. Did I made the right decision ?",

"Sending “Mixed signals” What’s with this whole speculation about females being the “confusing” ones in a relationship or females being responsible for sending “mixed signals”? Truly speaking, anyone who has been in a relationship or anything of the sorts would have come to realise it is the males who are unclear in their actions and bipolar in behaviour! If anything, the females are the ones who always have to be straightforward and clear yet the males who can’t catch onto (clear) social cues are the ones saying “Women are confusing.” Why are males so difficult?

Like some in my opinion are good. But that's s because I actually believe they're trying. Like Kendrick Lamar making both great melodies good lyrics and ultimately is just fun or actually great.

I’m not one to break a promise so, you're gonna get some idiotic ramblings. Let's start with what song I’m listening to. I am currently listening to Hot Rails to Hell by Blue Öyster Cult. I honestly hate that most of their fame comes from the stupid cowbell skit. Listen to their first three albums, and tell me those aren’t peak. Oh damn, the song is ending, I thought I would’ve written more than that. Oh well, we’re on another BÖC song, it’s called The Red & the Black, I quite like it. To be completely honest, I like basically all forms of music, as long as there’s heart put into it, that’s why I like older music. Sure, you can make millions by mumbling nonsense into a microphone to the most generic beat known to man, but where’s the fun in that? I’m not against rap either, I personally love the new stuff Kendrick has put out, plus almost all the classics have a certain charming “DIY” feel with the messily looped samples from old motown songs as beats that you can’t help but love. Honestly I’m probably only gonna finish one page tonight, it’s 2:40 currently, and I’m delirious. Oh well, I gotta finish the page though. In the time that sentence was written I listened to Divine Wind by BÖC, it was good, nice 6/8 groove. It’s repetitious, but that kinda works for the song. Maybe I should listen to someone else after this song (Deadline, by - you already know who) actually, I kinda want to listen to Lips in the Hills first. I promised other topics on the cover of this book, but for now on this page, imma talk about music. Music is kind of an anomaly when you think about it. Over the past few thousand, million, or however many years we’ve been around, we’ve found a way to make sounds pleasant to the human ears, which were mainly meant for communication and alerting the brain of any suspicious sounds that invoke danger. That’s honestly fascinating to me. We as a species can really come up with unique things when we put our minds to it, we aren’t bound by mental limitations like other animals, or pre-built mental formulas of how things are supposed to be. Honestly, if we can get the idea of a working formula out of the music industry, pop music nowadays wouldn’t be so damn BORING I swear, every single Taylor Swift song sounds the same to me, it's always something along the lines of “Oh I broke up with my boyfriend I’m so sad, even though I’ve done this 90 times before!” Why the hell can’t she do something unique? Something different? She has the whole world’s ears, she just needs to fire her large team of pop music writers and start making what she likes. A counterargument to this would be “oh she makes a ton of money off the working formula, why would she stop?” And honestly, that's a damn good point, I just want to see some creativity coming from her end. Speaking of songs about breaking up with people, I’m gonna ramble about relationships some. I’ve personally only dated one person, and it was pretty damn bad, she was so damn HYPER. My half asleep laid back brain could not comprehend what the hell was going on every 2 seconds. She would get pissed at me for something small and random that happened a few weeks prior, for example, I didn’t smile in a picture (I never do, I hate my face) and she got so damn pissed at me. Maybe that’s how women are, I don’t know, I’m not one. I only plan on dating women so maybe I’ll learn their “secrets” although I doubt it. To be completely honest, I might not date anyone at all. To be completely honest, I have trouble getting along with people in a relationship that’s bigger than friendship. I wish I had better conversational skills, because I can only talk to women in a joking manner, never anything serious.",

Is kissing the homies actually gay? Okay so me and my friend group all used to get together a couple weeks ago. We are all boys and basically we all got put on dates set up by our other friends. It’s five of us and five other girls getting ready for dates. We admit to each other in our friend group none of us has kissed a girl before and we don’t know how to so in case they try to kiss us we need a plan. That’s when my friend Matthew came up with the idea. We should practice kissing each other. “It won’t be gay cuz we don’t like each other” so basically we all started making out and we learned how to kiss and our dates went perfectly smooth and the girls have no idea we kissed. This isn’t gay right? ,

"how should i have reacted to my bestfriend cutting me out okay so my bestfriend of over 6 years and i stopped talking a few months ago. i am basically over it now but wanted to get some other teen opinions on the whole situation and how i reacted. so the story goes that me and her were super close, like her family basically took me in as their child close. the last time i entered her house was for her birthday sleepover, where we hung out in our small group. after our sophomore year started, things got weird. she started to text less and be more distant, which wasn't super odd cause our friendship wasn't high maintenance like that. however, she started hanging with new friends, and any attempts i made to hang with her were shut down, with her saying she's busy. now, i have other friends too, but i make sure to make time for all my friends i have. a friend of mine overheard her at one point telling her new group that she used to have just me, but now she has all of them, and basically making it out that our friendship wasn't fulfilling. i was caught off guard cause i never tried to make her feel she just had to hang out with me or anything of the sorts, and it hurt me cause it made me think i wasn't enough of a friend for her. the cherry on top was when she was taking me home one day from school she said she lied to a guy saying she was busy a lot so she didn't have to hang out with him, when in reality she hasn't even been busy that much. i just sat there staring ahead cause i realized she had been saying the same thing to me, and i had been desperately trying to see her, my BEST FRIEND. i let her become close with her other friends, cried a lot, and finally grew the balls to text her asking her if we were okay. i basically wrote a whole paragraph asking if i did anything wrong and how i really miss us and didn't want to lose her, and she responded saying its just something that happens during high school and someone did this to her last year so she didn't want to make me feel that way. it didn't make me feel better at all, but i let it be. my parents started to grow confused and after not telling them what was going on i finally broke down and told them what happened. at no point did i get mad at her, but i feel like i still have a hole in my chest and she seems completely fine.",

"Sleep Cycle I feel overwhelmed with everything; so overwhelmed that I want to just shut down, go to sleep, and never wake up--to be alive only in my dreams. I find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed each morning. After I wake, I find wisps of dream-worlds still alive in my mind, luring me back to sleep for another hour, then two hours, only with the goal to distract myself further from reality. I find myself with a greater disconnect to the real world each afternoon. I close my eyes tight shut for a few seconds, then open them to only find disappointment. In the evenings, when I peer through my blinds to see another setting sun, I gain an exponential yearn for sleep. A yearning for complete darkness--complete loneliness. This yearning carries into the few dark hours before I crawl into bed, still as awake as I was when I left it earlier that day. Although, as much as I crave succumbing to my dreams, I still find it difficult to sleep. I've grown tired of tiredness; I've had to learn to live a life without it. And even when I do fall asleep, I have mostly nightmares, but those nightmares--as haunting and excruciating as they can be--are still more desirable than real life, and only for one reason. Even in nightmares, I can still wake up and dream up a new one; change up my reality in a matter of seconds (or, what seems like seconds). Even after particularly frightening nightmares that leave me sweat-ridden and bleary-eyed, I can still drift back to sleep, alive in a new world, a different world that I can exist in without a permanent care.  I dream of dreams in my waking hours, but in those hours I dream of nothing, for all of my dreams have already come true. ",

"My brother can never take a joke. It's infuriating. I have a younger brother (14) who can never seem to take a joke. Almost every joke he makes is at the expense of others yet when another person makes fun of him it's suddenly not funny. He does this thing where he'll make this atrocious fake laugh in response to anything thrown at him. I laughed at it once or twice and I guess that gave him the confidence to keep it rolling. Other times he’ll blatantly just say “That's not funny”. There was one encounter about a week ago where he made a joke about my younger cousin. He said, “You’re so fat I can feel your footsteps from upstairs”. I really hate when he and my other cousins make fun of their younger sisters' weight not just because their totally average but because they're young girls and seemingly internalize it. One of the girls said she didn't want another helping of food because she was fat. Anyways, I responded, “We can't hear yours because your legs are too heavy to lift off the ground, you just shuffle”. It was immature but too funny to let go and I knew it would also make my younger cousin laugh. My brother got this dead pane stare and in fashion said: “That wasn't funny”.",

"Basic friend zoned story Probably shouldn’t be saying this as my friends stalk me online, but idc anymore. This girl I’ve known for a few years and was in my class started to look more and more attractive, until basically I was happy Everytime I saw her. Still am. But as I got closer, I couldn’t tell if she was flirting or was just my friend. It wasn’t very obvious. I was gonna ask her out, but I needed the right time to see if she actually liked me or if she was just nice to me specifically. Didn’t wanna ruin the friendship we already had, asking a friend out is hard. Next thing you know, as I’m on the verge of asking her out, she gets a bf. Some tall dude who’s barely a guy. I’m not angry at him or her. I’m angry at me. I probably should have seen this coming. And falling for a friend doesn’t usually end well. But finding out she still treats me the same, she’s just nice. Means we were just friends the whole time. And here I thought she liked me. Pretty stupid. Don’t feel super great. I was dumb to want something, maybe a wife someday. Nope",

"It’s ridiculous There’s some latino/black guy at my middle school who got expelled from his previous school because he was a violent troubled kid. When he transferred he become popular in the school. The thing is he has a habit of causing too much BS to happen. He’s threatening kids and peer pressuring them to fight him (he’s one of the strongest kids in school btw) knowing he’ll win cuz the guys at my school are stupid. He causes so much trouble for the teachers to the point where he almost got one of the good teachers (almost everyone at school likes him) fired or arrested because he made up some lie about him assaulting him to the principal. Secondly, for some stupid reason the teachers all seem the like him for god knows what. Also he acts like a gangster and sags his pants (walks a little weird and throws gang signs, but not underwear showing luckily) Third, I’ve noticed an uptake in guys trying to act like him (basically try to be gangster, but failing because they damn well aren’t and have loving and supportive parental figures). AND, the guy comes from a good home with two loving parents that support him. I don’t know why almost everyone at my school respects and loves this guy while he’s the most violent kid I’ve ever seen at my school who literally threatens kids for the stupidest things imaginable. He has a girlfriend that definitely knows all this which makes me feel ridiculous how this is possible to withese.",

"Update on last post. You guys who responded to my last post are right. I am just gay. This whole time what I've felt for boys is what I should've been feeling for girls and I didn't even realize it. Straight people don't feel like I do. I think I've always known that, deep down. That I was different. I'm not meant to feel like this, but I do, and I think that Nathan knows as well. Yesterday and today he started heavily flirting, and the worst part is that I didn't stop him. I didn't tell him I was taken or that I didn't like guys. I think it's because I did want him to say things like that to me. Not because I was taking what he was saying with a grain of salt or that I was too embarrassed to, I wanted him to. Everything about just saying that feels wrong. I've never really known much about queer people, but to what I can tell there's supposed to be some relief to realizing what you are. I don't feel that? My life is over. It isn't actually something I can just fix and brush off. It isn't just the way l act. It's what I am. You always hear about being proud, but nobody talks about the shame. Maybe they just don't feel it. The problem is, I don't know what I'm ashamed of. Leading on my best friend? Deep-set homophobia? Or is it just the fact that I can't grow up and have a wife and kids and love a woman and be loved in return? I think it's all of them. I feel gross? Especially because he isn't even the first guy I've liked, I don't think. It's like I've betrayed all the boys I've called pretty, because they trusted that it didn't mean anything. But it does. I wish it didn't. The scariest part is that there's really, genuinely nothing I can do to get rid of this feeling. The feeling that rests in my chest, it'll just never go away? I feel like I need to fix it, I guess? Fix myself that is, not try to make girls something I can love, just change me. It isn't supposed to be like this, not for me. It's like I'm seeing myself for the first time. I don't like what I see.",

"What are your opinions on AI It feels like I've only ever met two different types of people, those being people who use AI daily and those who think it will take over the world, and I don't understand either side. First of all I don't understand why they believe AI will take over the world, as the whole basis of their argument is that it will get smarter than us and take over, but it already is and it hasn't done shit. As far as I can tell it has no emotions, it was no desires, and that's what make it artificial, however I also don't understand those who l use it frequently because in a way it impedes upon ones independence. That's my thoughts on it, what do y'all think.",

"The Science- Based WAY to Achieve ULTIMATE Consistency  Since being on self improvement for about 2 years I’ve learned what consistency is NOT. For example, it is not about  writing a to do list the night before and labeling what you are going to do the next day. Consistency is not about going through stages of isolation where you are focusing on doing the work and forcing it. It is also not about waiting for the perfect time of when you feel good either. It has only been through learning from trial and error of this BS youtube videos of what people say consistency is about only to find myself trying something for a couple of days, and messing up right after then going back to my old ways. I am sure that many of you reading this right now struggle with something similar and you want to get off this cycle of trying something for a few days, stopping, trying again only to realize you are never going to be consistent.

Also it seems that in his past relationships he made the first move, though I've been taking a bit more initiative in texting and what not. So the fact he hasn't asked yet kinda worries me.

"I need some advice Last year I met a girl, and we quickly became friends, I was immediatly in love cuz I thought: ""omg I'm talking to a girl I've never done this b4"" Fast forward a couple of months and were still friends, and I know she likes me because it's very noticable. I started falling out of love though, she never talks to me when we're together, like we went on a walk for about an hour, and I was talking to her and gave her oppurtunities to say stuff to me, but she just never says something. Which is really annoying and not attractive to me.",

I have a lot of trauma because of my dad and even hate the language that my family speaks because of it. My mom emotionally abused me after she left my dad who physically abused her. I've spent my entire life dealing with both of their bs because my mom ""is doing her best"" and I ""should think of all the stress she's had."" I have to deal with my dad because ""he's just stubborn"" and ""he will never change."" He acts r-worded sometimes and doesn't have any common sense. I can tell him I'm about to throw up but will continue to force me to do something. He has even sexualized me since I was a child and no matter what I say everyone plays it off as ""he's just your dad you're reading into it."" What kind of dad will walk into their daughters room without knocking (I don't have a lock) when he **knows** she's changing as says she looks *good* while she's wearing just a oversized shirt (no pants or shorts) when she's barely a preteen. I get absolutely disgusted when he touches me in certain parts of my body when I'm trying to get away from him but he grabs me. I fear masculine men because of him and don't feels safe when I'm alone with someone stronger than me. ",

I don’t know of any place that’d take adult runaways, nor can I think of a place he can reasonably run off *to*. His mom is paying for part of his tuition, so he feels like he has to stay for the money. Ideally we rent together and he doesn’t need his mom’s money, but neither of us are fully employed. He’s gonna leave eventually, but I want him out of that house as early as possible. What should I do?",

"In half a year, my teenage years will be over. To get straight to the point, I messed up these teenage years by being addicted to my phone, games, and getting stoned. I have no close friends, but I want to make the best of it while I am still a teenager. Where do I begin? I know this is a cry for help, and comparison is the thief of joy, but people around my age and even younger than me are living the social teenage lives I wish I lived. The innocent love and banter are missing in my life as adulthood is now at my doorstep. I guess I just want to make the most of it, so if you all have tips for me to improve my social life this summer, I would appreciate it so much! Take care, everyone! And if you're younger than me, please throw your phone away and make the best of these years so you don't end up with the same problem I have right now!",

What to focus on Hello I’m a guy on 17 years. Right now I’m very conflicted on what I want to do for a living or what “career” I should pursue. The two careers I go back and forth between is a professional MMA Fighter or making it with my metal band.,
"I think I’m being falsely accused of SA Alright so for this story there is a lot of context to know that’s necessary. First of all, me and the girl I’m talking about are both 15. We started talking when we both started high school and eventually got into a talking stage, which was on and off usually just for stupid reasons which we could both laugh about later on. About 1.5 years ago she started opening up to me about her depression. She told me things like harming herself etc. I was always there for her and eventually convinced her to talk to a teacher about it. Later she got into a relationship with a boy, but he treated her terribly and even though she told him about everything going on with her he tried manipulating her into sending pictures and stuff like that and started spreading lies about her. Eventually they broke up and she told her parents about her depression and self-harm. When all of this was happening I was always there for her and tried helping her however I could. Later on she decided that it would be better if me and her wouldn’t have any contact for a while so she could use all of her limited energy on herself an trying to get better. Over the next year me and her were talking sometimes throughout the year and since december of last year we have been talking daily and we started to catch feelings for each other again. She also told me stuff like how she tried to commit suicide multiple times last year. One day, she didn’t respond to my messages and when I asked her what happened she told me that she was in the hospital because she tried to OD. A few days later she got out and me and her hung out a few days later with another friend of her. Then a few days later we hung out again, went bowling, I watched her football/soccer match and we were basically together all day with a few other friends of her. At the end of the day we kissed for the first time and I went home. We decided to see each other again a few days later and it was amazing. We were in her room all day making out the entire time, basically just a cringy teenage relationship. She took her shirt off and we just continued what we were doing and after a while I asked her if she would be comfortable taking off her bra as well, and she said that she didn’t want to do it now, which I responded to that that’s totally okay and that I completely understand it. We continued what we were doing again and eventually she was basically laying on top of me while we were making out and she started pushing my head down to her breasts and I was kissing her body all the way down there. She held my head while I was down there and basically pushed me against them, so one one breast, I slightly pulled down her bra and started kissing her there for a few seconds and then went back up again. She still seemed completely comfortable and I asked her if she made up her mind and she nodded with a big smile on her face. We just continue making out and eventually I had to go to my football training. After I left she told me that she had an absolutely amazing time and that that day was perfect and her best day ever. She also sent me some of those corny tiktoks (that’s something we do often) and some of then where things like “touchy gf + touchy bf >>>” and stuff like that. She didn’t respond for a while and later that night she told me that she tried to kill herself again and that she would be admitted to a mental hospital. This is about the 4th time she tried it but this time she definitely got the closest to actually having it happen. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to keep up a relationship which I completely understood. She promised me that once this is all over that we would go back to what we had. We continued to just talk over the phone while she was there and we were still telling each other “I love you” and sending each other those corny tiktoks. She felt completely miserable in there and I tried being there for her and was sending her sweet texts every day. Some of those cringy tiktoks were things like “I’m craving you so much” which she responded “Soon I’m all yours again” to and “Once I get 1 kiss I need a 100 more” which she responded “Once I’m out there will be a lot of more kissed for you” and one that basically said that we should just marry which she responded “In three years” to. So basically we were still in love with each other and doing what cringy teenagers do. Eventually she told me that she completely lost all hope in life and that she’s only pretending to still have hope so that she’ll get out so she can do something again. I felt terrible hearing this and decided to tell her parents about this and they were very grateful. Of course she was angry at me at first, which is completely understandable but I know that it was for the better. She eventually forgave me but decided that we should have a little bit less contact now and eventually we stopped having contact. I though that this was because she didn’t want people to care about her too much so that it wouldn’t hurt them a lot if she dies, and she confirmed this later. Eventually she told me that we can have contact again but limited because she has to stick all of her energy into getting better, and I respected this of course. This also ended shortly and all of our contact now basically existed with me responding to her reposts on tiktok, assuring her she’s beautiful (because that was the main reason of her depression, basically hating herself and her body) etc. Eventually she reposted a video about that just had some dates in it (dates as in feb. 11 for example) and it included the last day that we were together. I looked in the comments and saw people talking about those days like they were amazing dates, so I thought that that were her intentions for that repost as well, so I responded to her that it was the best day of my life. Of course I didn’t mean the last part of the day, but just the part that me and her were together. She got mad at me because I understood it wrong and she told me that it wouldn’t work out between us and that we should stop having contact. She has already been back home for a few weeks now by the way. Yesterday, I saw a repost of her that was about being SA’d and I responded saying that this is very serious and I asked her who did this to her. Later she told me that it was about us and I was completely shocked. She told me that when I slightly pulled her bra down she just froze and let it happen and I just didn’t understand. She told me that it was the best day of her life, she immediately started making out with me for like an hour after it happened, she told me she loved me, after I left she told her parents that we were dating, she sent me those corny tiktoks, she told me that we’d marry in 3 three years when we’re both 18, she told me that once she’s back she’s all mine again, after I left she was with one of her friends and told her all about what happened and how amazing it was and she promised me that whatever happens, that we’d go back to what we had. Who would do things like that after feeling like she just got SA’d? She now told me that she would leave it at this if I stopped texting her, but I’m still scared to death that she’ll take this any further. She can ruin my life with these accusations. Was I in the wrong? And would should I do now? Is she just remembering it wrong because of everything else going on?",

"I feel like my parents dont get that im bored Im pretty much constantly bored, i have been my whole life and there not helping in any way shape or form. my parents act like boomers' way too much they always suggest dumb stuff or something a 5-year-old would do, like watch tv, cartoons, or eat and such stuff, i find none of those things interesting or they go on and on about their childhood in way that makes me feel like there trying to make me act like how they did.",

"Tearing Us Apart Hey I’m a 16 year old boy from Australia and I’m in a pop punk band called Heatstroke and we just dropped a new single called “Tearing Us Apart”. It would mean the world if you guys would listen to our song so that we can get some better outreach and maybe eventually do this music thing full time. Thanks, Zen. ",
