"The CDC's website really helped me 

 [https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/youth-resources.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/youth-resources.htm) 

Maybe it can help you too."
"okay for  a little backstory, i've known im nonbinary for about 3 years now. i've been out to my parents for over a year. when i came out i said i would like to use they/them pronouns. they do really good at calling me my name, but neglect my pronouns. and when i try and ask my mother to use they/them she gets all defensive because she is certain i don't use them. so i just stopped asking her because i don't want to get yelled at. but it's causing me really bad dysphoria and i don't know how to tell her. does anyone have any tips about this? :/"
"So i’m a lesbian & i’ve been “coming out” for the past 2 years. What I mean by that is my mom is semi homophobic (she doesn’t like/agree with anyone not cis & straight but she won’t bully people about it) and when i try to tell her that I don’t like guys at all or that I like girls she’ll either completely ignore me or she’ll say that social media is pushing me to be that way and i’m not actually “that way”, AKA she’s in complete denial about it, so i’ve told her multiple times since 2018. Every time I mention it though I feel super bad afterwards & I feel like an idiot for saying it out loud. I’m not ashamed at all to be in the lgbtq+ community & I LOVE the fact that i’m a lesbian so I don’t know why I feel ashamed when I say it out loud. Has anyone else experienced this after coming out?"
"I am Bi but nobody knows it. Even I’m still really figuring it out but I really want to talk to someone about it but I’m terrified to tell anyone because all my family and friends are Christians and I don’t know who is going to be accepting of me. My parents are really homophobic so I know I can’t tell them (not yet anyway) but now I have to put up with their homophobic shit 24/7 and I need someone to vent to BUT I CANT TELL ANYONE so I came here to vent. That’s all, thank you for listening."
"Hey so I'm 16 and attempting to write a murder mystery story with a gay non-binary main character, as someone who isnt non-binary I would love some guidance on this part.
I'm lesbian so I've got the gay part down."
"So like, obviously I've been questioning ever since I was like, eleven- suggesting the fact that I'm probably not straight. That's all I know though. I probably like girls but I can't tell if I like guys or if that's just heteronormative tendencies speaking. I was incredibly sheltered as a kid and didn't know gay people existed until I was ten, so up until that point, I just thought that I was going to marry a guy one day and that's it. I've had to slowly warm up to what being gay meant and now I imagine relationships with girls just as much as relationships with guys. It's really confusing though cause when it comes to imagining sexual situations I only imagine men, but when it comes to marriage and living the rest of my life, I only imagine women. Am I imagining men in sexual situations because it's the only thing I've been shown or am I imagining women in loving domestic situations cause men scare me? (I didn't grow up in all that great of a household.) It's really confusing and it's kinda stopped me from dating. (I'm seventeen, I haven't dated my entire life- I've been trying to play it off cool by telling everyone that I just don't have time for it and that I like to be independent, which has a certain truth to it, but it's also because I'm terrified.) Sorry if this paragraph is hard to read, I'm usually more eloquent but my mind's scattered and I'm exhausted. I might edit later so sentences make more sense. If someone had a similar experience to mine, it'd be really helpful to hear how they figured things out. Thanks for reading."
"I just found who my crush is! And I know, that isn't a big deal, but it is, I am 15 y/o and I've known for the last two years that I'm gay and no one knows but the thing is that I didn't have a crush on anyone to the point in which I thought I was asexual (which is not bad and I am not against it but I want to love someone and that someone to love me back) but anyways, I was re-watching A series of Unfortunate Events (The series) and I realized my crush is Dylan Kingwell (portrays Duncan Quagmire). He is 15 too, and perfect (needless to say)

[Soooo... There is him and no one cares](https://preview.redd.it/0twkxp3vcjr41.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d781dbf7d02c740e9df07564932e961f268904e)

So I've (f14)known him(m14) before he even thought he was trans and we've been friend for 4 years and i realized that i liked him two years ago. We have kissed a couple times in the past and i kissed him even when he was dating someone and they are still dating and his significant other doesnt know. He made the move twice and i did it the last time and he kissed me back and TOLD me he liked me back but wants to keep his relationship with his significant other. Advice on getting over him?
Hii guys..
"hello lgbtq+ bitches! anyways, i was lookin to see if anyone finna dm me just bc.
not sure you want to? 
i have lovely reasons:

1) im like antisocial so thisll b fun

2) and if you just wanna vent i gotchu fam

3) i have a lot of annoying facts like


-gay penguins steal straight penguins eggs so they can be dads. they often trick the couple by taking the egg and replacing it with a rock. even in zoos, zookeepers have to give them eggs since they refuse to b straight.

-the planet mercury is a symbol used by the transgendered community. the sign for mercury is a crescent shape and a cross, which represents the male and female principles in harmony in an individual. which made the god mercury fathered hermaphroditus, who had both male and female sex organs.

-gay people tend to be left-handed much more often than heterosexuals.

-the entire species of the dwarf chimpanzee is bisexual. lions have also exhibited homosexual behavior. homosexual behavior has been observed in over 1,500 animal species.

-the worlds first pro-LGBT organization was found in 1897 in current germany. they sought to repeal a law that criminalized sex between males. amongst the people that signed their petition was albert einstein.

-in 1978 dutch scientists discovered a potential, natural occurring, chemical found in potatoes which had the ability to change the sexual orientation of any animal which feeds off it.

-""swag"" is just an acronym from a group of gay guys in the 60s that stands for ""secretly we are gay""

yes all that and more 😂"

So I recently had a huge crush on a non-binary person and I have had crushes on girl and guys but I’m not sure what sexuality that is I think it’s pan but I’m not sure
"Yea you read the title right. Kanye West is a transphobe. Now I have never liked him to begin with, and since I saw some very transphobic things on his Twitter, I just hate his guts now. So if any of y'all trans folk have Twitter, you may want to check out what he's posted, and report him like I did."
The Covid-19 virus has split up me and my girlfriend and we now cant see each other until its out of our state and i just miss her so much😭😭
"My mom just said this homophobic crap and I had to sit there and pretend I didn’t wanna smack the stupid outta her. I love my mom, and usually she acts kind to queers, but she talks crap behind their backs & little does she know I’m bi, and her words kinda hurted my feelins. :/"
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
"So, finally I’ve done it! Her name is Katie and she’s just as goofy and extra as I am <3"
"Hi, I’m really new to the lgbtq+ community and I’m still struggling to fully understand my sexuality. I haven’t come out to my peers, although they have been accepting towards lots of other queers, I just feel like I’m not ready. I have a crush on a girl in my music class and she totally gives me gay vibes. She’s never said anything about liking guys, she dresses like a skater girl, sometimes mixing it up with a few hoodies and she has short nails. She compliments me sometimes and it totally makes my day, but I have no clue how to talk to her. I have her Snapchat from a group chat we’re both in, but I don’t know how to start a real conversationnnnn. Shes super sweet, but I just don’t know if we have any common interests other than music, and it’s difficult to start a random convo in the middle of class, and one on the Internet would be awkward. I could really use some advice on how to talk to her, I want to explore my sexuality and I really do like her. Thanks for reading my rant lol sorry it was long 💖

Edit: she complimented my new maddens and a few of my outfits and I said I really liked her style. When we were at a class function, we had to walk in a single file line and she tripped and bumped into me and obviously got kinda nervous and said sorry. I just kinda laughed it off and said the purple streaks she had just gotten in her hair looked nice.

Edit pt 2: I honestly didn’t realize I liked her for a long time, I used to kinda hate her actually, when I thought I was straight, but I never made it obvious. The feeling was almost like jealousy, but then I realized it wasn’t of her it was that I wasn’t with her. I had noticed myself staring at her and stuff and I had a few dreams about her and I just had no clue why until now."
"I’m les, just wanted to say That I’m so fing happy"

"I recently came out as bisexual and confessed to my crush (we are both females), but I don't have that much of an attraction to guys as much as I do with girls (sorry if it is hard to understand what I'm trying to say, I'm bad at explaining things). My preference is mainly girls, but I don't know how to properly explain it. So, I was hoping that you can help me out with my situation. Thank You!!"

So a few years ago I found out I was pansexual. At the time a had a huge crush on this girl but it didn't matter to me that she was a girl I just liked her personality and her in general. I liked another person that year but since then I've kinda just swayed more towards guys. And now I don't even know who I'm into guys/girls/both or just guys? I'm not sure and it's messing up my head I would appreciate any advice on this
I'm a homosexual

"I’m lesbian, just wanted to say that"
"LGBT teenagers, how bi / homophobic is your school? Mine is generally not, but there is this one guy who is honestly obsessed with being homophobic. Today he came up to me (not out as anything) “X is not gay, I really think you’re straight now”. My friend looks at him like ..???... and he is like “What? Isn’t it a good thing if I am telling people he’s straight” and my friend was like “What is wrong with being gay?” and he was like “Everything?”.  I don’t know, it’s just him and others are not really, expressively at least. How is it for you.

I don't know. I am bisexual but now I'm just scared."

"My hair has always been long and I did quite like it long but it was annoying sometimes so I considered getting it cut short but not seriously thought about it. However, last night I just cut it and I love it. However, I've cut off quite a bit (it was down to my waist and now it's up to my shoulders) and I need to hide it from my parents.

Does anyone know how I can?"

"Hey, I'm Sam. And I'm wondering something. It's hard to explain I guess. I know I don't feel like a girl, I'm assigned male at birth. I present male, but I don't really feel like a certain gender you know I just feel human. I don't know how people know what gender they feel? I'm not trying to be dismissive I 100% support all of you guys I'm just questioning myself. I'm trying to figure out if I'm non binary. I don't feel like a gender, Id like to be androgynous really. But I don't know what dysphoria feels like or if I'm trans 9r what. I don't know! I'm fine and comfortable with my body other then some insecurities about my weight but. Im fine with my body. Im fine being called he/him, or they/them. I really don't mind. It's just all so confusing. Any advice?  Thanks so much :)."

"I thought I was making a lot of progress with my family, but today I woke up and overheard them saying really homophobic things thinking I was still asleep. I feel like everything I worked for towards their acceptance has been destroyed. I don’t know what to do. I don’t think they will ever accept me."
"I need help, I fucked up big time


So a few weeks  ago I made a discord server for my school’s GSA and I made the roles puns about sexuality/gender identity etc. most of them where just stupid puns and harmless fun, except one, unknowingly as a result of my lack of education I made one of the roles super derogatory and bad. Now for the next part you need to know something first. I have a lot of trouble in social situations as a result of me not having any friends like literally at all until I was about 12 so I missed a lot of developmental social skills like knowing when a joke goes too far and picking up in inferences. So my friend tried to subtly hint that what I said was offensive but obviously I didn’t pick up on it. So then I just went on with my day thinking everything was a-OK but then when we got in an argument on the bus they brought up the discord role and how it was offensive and it shocked me, so much so I just kind of sat their and stared at the seat in front of me for the rest of the ride. We eventually talked and they said that my 35 page apology was useless and I said that they where right and I would try and educate myself then they said I was wrong and selfish, witch is when the second problem arose, I lashed out and yelled at them about how I spend most of my time talking one friend off of rooftops to stop him from killing himself talking another away from drugs and on the weekends helping disabled kids ski, how can I help fix our friendship we used to be their for each other now they haven’t spoken to me in weeks, (PS if I referred to my friend as he not they it’s a mistake they recently came out as non-bianary and I’m still getting used to not calling them “he”)"
"I keep having dreams of me making out with girls and holding their hands ect. Idk if my subconscious is trying to say something but im so confusedd. Im attracted to guys, but lately ive just been way more attracted to women. And i feel so much more open to dating a girl. And for someone who has been ""straight"" for a long time. This is all very weird. I feel fuzzy. Idk. Ive been trying to repress it for the past 4 years but now that im 16 feelings are really spilling out. Pls help idk how to feel right now."

"I’m a pansexual girl, but I’ve befriend a boy online who I consider a real life friend, even though I live in the UK and he lives in America. I met him in a discord group (before he transitioned) and we vibed really well. We talked a lot and he told me he was non binary and pan, and I told him I was pan. A couple months goes by and he tells me he likes girls, then a few weeks later he tells me he’s fully trans. We had long talks about it together, how he would tell his parents, his name, and just how he feels in general.

But, a few weeks ago, his discord account disappeared. It was completely gone. I reached out to others who know him, all I found out is that he’s fine, and he’s back in contact with his blood family. But something doesn’t feel right...
I did some research based on our time zone differences and I think he’s anywhere between Florida and Nevada. I’m really worried about him, and I miss talking to him

If, somehow we do get back in contact and he needs advice on his transition, what can I say to help him?"

I just told my mom I was bisexual and dating a boy. And I am happy to have that type of relationship with my mom. She wants me to be happy in life and she accepts me for who i am.
And she likes his music
"Everytime a guy flirts with me i get really uncomfortable, i dont find anything abt it fun or exciting. But whenever a girl does it im a little more open too it. And i feel fuzzy. Im not totally shutting down guys. But girls just seem more appealing to me and i dont understand why. Im so confused. I still want people near me to think im straight though. A lot of people at my school arent a fan of lgbtq people :( help.

"Hi, I'm *name* 
I'm an Asexual who is right now questioning everything!! yay-
Here's my situation:
So, for about 3 months I've identified as a Genderfluid. My birth gender was female but I always felt like that wasn't correct. But lately, whenever I get called by she/her pronouns, it pisses me off a lot. And I like going by he/him pronouns, so I'm not sure if I'm fully trans or not-- 
And I feel as though once I figure everything out that no one in my family would care, or they'd think it's all a phase or a big joke-- 
Can anyone help me at all? Or even just talk to me?

"I recently figured out that I’m ace panromantic. (Side note: apparently panromantic isn’t a word because it’s underlined in red wtf apple) 

Tonight, my mom was talking about having kids and dating guys, so I said “we need to have a conversation but not now” and nothing else. Later, she called me and tried to pressure me into telling her what the conversation needed to be about. I know my parents are fairly conservative and religious and I am absolutely petrified because I think she might have generally figured out what it is. Does anyone have any tips or advice?"
I know I like straight porn and I don't mind gay porn but I don't want to date a girl but I really want to date a guy. It's neer impossible to find gay guys at my school but it's extremely easy to find gay guys online but I'm to scared to actually meet up with people because it's been engrained into me that something will go wrong. it's so frustrating because I really want someone to hold me in there arms and make me feel safe but also there when I need a good old fashion f**k 😭 what do I do because I want someone to love and someone to love me.

Research shows that LGBTQ+ youth are more than two-and-a-half times more likely to have a mental health problem as those who identify as heterosexual.

Last year, the Anna Freud Centre launched On My Mind, a free website to support young people aged up to 25 with their mental health and wellbeing.  On My Mind was co-produced with young people including those from the LGBTQI+ community.  This short, anonymous survey will help us develop On My Mind to more effectively support LGBTQ+ young people who may be struggling or worrying about their mental health or wellbeing.

So I think I am pan but I also have never understood how some of my friends see someone they have never met before and they are like, they are sooooo hot! So I was always like yeah totally so hot but not meaning it but once I get o know them they are cute so I found out about the term Demisexual and I think I am Demi too but idk if I can be both Demi and pan.

Alright, hello everyone! So, I was wondering - should non-binary’s have their own restroom? I’m sure this is a very debated topic but I wanted to ask of EVERYONE’S opinion so matter race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, romantic identity, anything at all, please tell me what you think!

Please answer in the comments, or if you really wanna click a button here is the link to my post in the lgbtq+ Amino: http://aminoapps.com/p/rzgl4i

"I’m 16 years old currently for maybe a few months I’ve questioning my gender. I sometimes feel like female, I wear makeup very often, skinny jeans etc. Like traditional girly things but sometimes I just don’t? I still be wearing very traditional girl clothes and makeup but when I look in the mirror I don’t feel like a girl? I know I’m not transgender but maybe non binary? Or just a girl? I’m so confused can someone maybe help?"
What does the Q in LGBTQ mean?
"So, I’m gender fluid (switching between female and non-binary) and I’m wondering does anyone else wear a binder when their non-binary or whatever? I might but not sure, and just wondering if anyone else does. 
Thank you and have a great day or night!"
"My grandmother is very catholic and I am very gay 

I would like to tell the rest of my family but I don't know how she will react, my cousin is gender nonbinary and my grandma seems to be ok with them, but my grandma still calls them she/her. 

I don't know how she will react if I tell her

what should I do"
"i’m a lesbian. pretty girly, however lately i have been feeling more masculine. i have always been a tomboy and into sports. i don’t feel as tho i want to be the opposite sex (i don’t think) however i shop in the men’s department and feel more comfortable dressing not in feminine clothing. i feel really uncomfortable in my body/the way it looks. my family sometimes makes comments on the way i dress / lack of makeup and “girls attire” it i’m not sure what i’m feeling but i’m struggling with it. so any advice would help lots. i really appreciate it!! xoxo"
"So Hi! Uhm my names Mimi (Me-Me) uhm well not really, thats  just my nickname. But uhm I live in the USA, and I have no idea what my pronouns are, I think I might be gender-fluid. But im still a little confused about that to. I'm a female, pansexual and I know that I'm not  non-bianary but I'm torn between a trans-gender and a Gender-fluid. Its not that I'm uncomfortable in my own skin its just that, sometimes I HATE being a girl and other times I don't. But when I hate being a girl I go full guy mode. Like the hair, the clothes, the act, the voice, like I switch to a whole other gender, and that confuses me. So what should I do?"
"Hi guys! My names Damon! And yes I know it’s actually not Christmas/not even the month of December...

     

Anyways! I am a gender-fluid from Denmark {today it is him pronoun and I sound so gay ik ik} and I would love more than anything to have people to talk to! So feel free to hit me up but...
Now, I refuse to talk to a 32 year old Karen in Japan who wants to know how to work a microwave or a 83 year old Dave who’s a creep in the USA! Now that’s out of the way, I don’t think there’s much more for thou reader to know about me ._.

"I am a male, and normally I feel happy this way. However, sometimes I start to feel like a female. This only happens every few months, and usually when I’m watching porn or something similar. I don’t know if I’m trans or not, and I’m really confused."
Hi I've noticed that lot of LGBTQ+ people struggling with eating disorders and I haven't see any chat groups for people struggling with that junk and I know its really hard to cope with it and I think itd be cool to have people who understand it too

Using a throwaway for this

I’m a lesbian, I’ve been a gay child even before I knew it had a word. I’ve never liked a boy, have always been attracted to girls, The second I found out what I meant i knew. I’m not out to my family, my friend (who is gay) has known for years and so has my other mate who wholeheartedly supports me. Today I came out to another friend. 

But, I want to come out to my family, my mum has said she dosent care what I am, just as long as I’m not an asshole of a human, I’m not sure about my dad, I’m terrified to come out but I really want to. I can’t keep the gay jokes in much longer, honestly I think my mum knows already 

Could anyone help me? Thank you ❤️"
"Okay, so I have a best friend who literally can’t stand her boobs and wants a binder but she’s afraid to ask her mother for one because her father is extremely conservative and she’s afraid her mom will tell him. I really want to help her because I love her and want her to be happy (also she said she’d get me food lol) and I need to find a store that sells them. We live in Canada and I really need help on this. She only has cash, no way to buy one online. If you have any information please respond to this"
"

So , I’m sexually and romantically attracted and to females but not to mails . But I still wanna have a romantic relationship with mails . So I’ve been surfing the web for the longest time and I can’t find anything. So , what sexuality am I ?"
IM CONSTANTLY MISGENDERED. I always wear boy clothes and I got a short haircut to hide my girliness. Everyone still uses she/her pronouns. I'm moving to a new school next year. I want people to wonder what gender I am because everyone just assumes I'm a girl right now. Help?
I started thinking about my crush and when I start liking him. I’ll save you the details but he was really friendly and it was just noice. Anyways 4 months later I was like... ‘Did he like me.’ The more I thought about the more the more frustrated I got at myself for being so blind. Omg he literally said ‘love you.’ And I passed it as straight boy stuff.
""
So this “straight” guy that I’ve been talking to says sweet dreams to me every night and we talk almost all day long but he recently ran into one of my friends and brought me up and he said “he knows I’m straight right” and he knows I like him but we still have hung out alone like going to the movies ect.. and I don’t know how to proceed what do I do is he gay or not???
Whenever i tell somebody im pan they asume im a lesbian FML
I was at a gay pride 🏳️‍🌈 and I saw a table and it was selling all the flags and I bought the lesbian flag and it was huge. I put it around my shoulders I ran into the middle of the street where the parade was just ending and I danced at the end of the long beautiful line and it was amazing...I hope I can do that in real life to 😁

"Hi, I am pretty new to Reddit so feel free to direct me to a different subreddit where this would be more appropriate.

I'm a 15 year old AFAB person who is currently very confused about their gender. I don't experience any kind of discomfort with being called by any name or pronoun, although I would prefer him/his. I recently have gotten very uncomfortable with my long hair and really want to get a pixie haircut, although my parents won't allow it. I have lessened this to some extent by keeping my hair in a braid almost daily for a week now. I am technically pansexual but due to trauma I only feel comfortable with people with a female bottom-area. I do like my curvy bodytype and really adore pretty dresses, however if I had the choice to choose my AGAB (both my name, body and pronouns) I would without the blink of an eye pick to be a boy. For some reason if I was AMAB I would actually wear boys clothing and not feel a need for dresses at all even though most of the wardrobe I have now is dresses or skirts. I still to a lesser extent feel as though I should have a male bottom and not a female one. I've noticed that wearing very feminine clothing makes me act a lot like a stereotypical cis woman, relying on others to make choices for me, is very helpless and very low self-esteem and confidence. I am not at all like this on the inside, it's like I'm just acting like what I feel is expected of me, today I tried on a boys jacket I felt way more me, same when I wear jeans although I think boys clothing would allow me to let even more go of this weird behavior (this is just a hypothesis though). My parents are quite conservative so I am worried they might not be very supportive if I first claim to be one thing later to realize I am something else entirely. So please if you think you might know what is up with me I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance
Kira"

"Hi! I’m (f 21) bisexual. I am currently in a hetero relationship with my boyfriend of 5 yrs because I dated him during my teen years he was basically my first everything. I would say I’m mostly attracted to women but I’m I never “came out” to anyone because I was always in a hetero relationship. Lately I wonder if I’ve subconsciously used my boyfriend as an excuse to not come out to anyone. At the end of the day, I guess it doesn’t really matter but sometimes it feels like I’m hiding a big part of who I am. 
So I guess my question is: is there any point in coming out when I’m in a long-term hetero relationship? Or should I just not tell anyone and if my boyfriend and I broke up then kinda “come out.” Also, by come out I don’t really mean make a big Facebook post to ppl I don’t care about (not that this is the wrong way at all, everyone has the right to be proud and post!!) I would be telling my parents, siblings, close friends and identifying as bisexual out loud."
Am I gay? (yI am a guy) and I am dating an FtM. So does that technically make me gay.

I'm not really sure of I'm bi or not. I'm a girl. I know that I like boys, but of a see a hot girl I like her too. I have never been on a relationship, so I don't know if it's normal to just see a boy and be like ""damn he hot"" and then to see a girl and be like ""She cute"".

I’m attracted to boys 100% but I’ve also found myself attracted to girls. I’d be watching tv or at the mall or something and I’d see a girl think wow she’s beautiful and I’d get the same feelings I’d get with a man. I’ve never dated or talked to a girl like that. I’m not a bold person and this makes me even more terrified. Idk what this means. Or how to approach this or anything. I just need advise.

Sorry to such a weird question."
"I'm a girl and bicurious, but I want to know if I dedinatly am or I'm not. I 100% like guys, I can see a guy and think ""hey hes cute/hot"" and I've had a boyfriend before. With girls, it's kinda different. I've never really seen a girl and thought shes cute or hot or that I'd date her. But I've seen lesbian couples and thought that I would maybe want that. I'd be fine with dating a girl, but I dont know if that's the same as being bi. It could be that I'm just accepting taht my sexuality might change. Also I've hugged a few girls and have thought ""why do I feel like I want to kiss her?"" Or ""I want to protect her"". To make it even more complicated, I'm very lonely cuz I have no friends and my boyfriend broke up with me. And theres one girl who's very affectionate with everyone and holds their hands and hugs them. So I dont know if I'm just wanting attention and love. Sorry it's so long.

"It’s been a good few years (more than 4) since I’ve been having thoughts/feelings of being a girl, but in the last month or 2 it’s been getting so much stronger. Just to be clear I don’t strongly HATE my gender but I think I would rather be female, has anyone else gone through this? I have a female partner who says she’s ok with it if I was to become a a girl. I feel so much more comfortable in her clothes than male ones, I really wish I could go out like it but my anxiety stops it :( but as I said I don’t strongly hate my gender as I currently am, but I have 3 questions;

1; has anyone else been through this and had HRT and not regretted it?

2; does this make me transgender (I really do want to go on HRT and I kind of want for you to say yes to help me confirm this)

3; as all above, how hard would it be to get prescribed hormones considering I said that I don’t exactly hate my gender?

"☀︎[‘ello, as you can see by my username, 8th grader here. not relevant whatsoever, except to add that i’m a 14 y/o female who’s probably genderfluid. maybe idk lol. just gonna talk about how i’m feeling about my sexuality and gender identity i guess :p]☀︎

sometimes, i feel like i should have a penis between my legs.

it doesn’t have to do with my personality, whether or not i have one that describes a person who generally has “manly man that exudes STRONG bursts of maScuLine energy” (talking about stereotypes about men and how there are people who think that people who look and act this way should have ze’ dick between their legs).

but then the times where i ACTUALLY go to take a shower, i realize i have a body! “wow! i haven’t seen THIS thing in ages. bruh, why did i think about chopping off these lumps! and my hips! why did i think about hormoning them away!?”

haha, i’m exaggerating though. i don’t hate the fact that i have boobs and wide hips. i like the way i look, love it actually. i guess i’m “confident” thought it’s only boosted by the fact i like my own body, not by what people might have told me (i don’t remember, lol)

but sometimes i want to feel more masculine, i FEEL more masculine. i had an epiphany a month(?) back where i was writing a cis-girl, for ONCE (i’ve always felt more comfortable writing guys, and if i were writing a girl, they’d be a projection of myself so it didn’t feel uncomfortable or any different) and after about 2000k words, i read back, thought about what to write next, and was stumped...how do i write a girl!? “wha—wait, but i AM one, uh—kinda, i guess?” totally didn’t know what to write. i’m still gonna continue that story—i can’t change her sex or anything because it’s supposed to be a les story so i cant make excuses...

and with sexuality, i can say that im pan (Ah yes, the curvature of achingly cold metal that sends shivers down my spine at the sight of it, my lips glistening and red as I stare impatiently at the sadly impotent and still laying piece of metal on my kitchen stove. Black grease covered it’s expanses with a layer of charred salmon skin lying upon it. I sighed. I was too lazy to take the pan out to a date to the sink. Better luck next time...) or maybe demi? in my whole life, i’ve never really had a crush, and i don’t really know what it’s like to be attracted to people. i probably have been attracted to someone before, but i’m ULTRA aware of my feelings so maybe not.

(this is so fucking random, i’m sorry to whoever reads this, lol. just a person who writes a lot...)

i can say that i might’ve had a crush, but i really don’t think so. 7th grade, in math. a girl sat in front of me dark brown short hair that went to her shoulder. pale-ish skin but anyone could tell that she had a little mexican in her blood unless they were blind (metaphorically and literally). big eyes, long eyelashes and thin lips. she was pretty, as un-crushily i could say it. one day she confessed to me, in the middle of class (like just talking to me during work) and would tease me sometimes by randomly saying if we should go out or something. mind you, i was 13. it was also a year ago, but i wasn’t comfortable at the idea of dating at that age even when a lot of other kids were doing it. too young, ya know? still too young now, but don’t really give a shit right now...anyway, i was incredibly nervous. she gave me a note before class ended, and instantly i pointed out all of the spelling mistakes, but my heart pounded and i was nervous around her. my best friend at the time (still friends with them, will explain later) said that whenever i talked about them my cheeks would go all red and stuff, but in the end, i gave her a note before the end of class that was a fuck load of scramble-dee-fuck that i didn’t realize until the next day, and i knew because 1. i didn’t  remember any of the shit i wrote, and 2. i remember going off topic, a lot. just know that my note ran along the lines off, “sorry, i don’t want to lead you along.” i wanted to become friends though, i didn’t know her much. i wanted to get to know her a bit more and maybe become friends. who knows? maybe we’ll grow closer and build something over time that leads into something else. i left my phone number on the note, hoping she’d text or something. never did. whole thing blows over and it’s getting closer to summer (may probably, don’t remember) and i started to approach her. covert glances during math. whenever we’d have games during P.E (which were rare, but we’d either play capture the flag or soccer, the class is split into 2 teams where we wore these knitted colored “jerseys”) i would chase her. i was super awkward around her, super shy. one time, during a day when we played soccer (i’m not athletic at all, please kill me when i’m outside under the fucking sun during summer, forced out of my will) i would just sit on the grass on the border of the invisible perimeters, and if she was from my team or the others, sometimes she’d go sit with her friends by me, or if she came from the neighboring field. suuuuuuper awkward. she asks me about random questions “what’s your favorite pet?” and stuff like that. the weekend comes. friday? i can feel the glow of nervousness and butterflies at the thought of her. saturday? i can still feel it, the acid bubble in my stomach (not the deadly kind, lol) but sunday? it faded. i was depressed at the time, and that day was a really dark one. i’m a very apathetic person, and looking back i feel like the depression was something that grew because of my own apatheticness. i felt very empty. cold. muted. everything was in black and white and nothing was ever warm colored. the “crush” cooled down completely. at the time, i called it the “3 day crush” because those last few events happened over 3 days. never really took notice of her again, and her hellos to me down the hallway decreased. looking back, i never felt attracted to her. she was pretty, cute, but i never felt attraction really. it makes me wonder if feelings rubbed off, or if i’m demisexual. don’t know yet...because first i have to actually have romantic feelings for someone, and that hasn’t happened yet.

so, right now i’m sticking with my cold, metally pans. i’m not uncomfortable at the thought of being with a guy or girl, kissing them, making out with them, or having sex with them—oh wait. that last one. yes...but also no. if you remember, i’m female. which means that with whomever i’m with in the future, romantically, sexually or both, MEANS i’d be having sex with them. don’t get the picture yet? yeah, you wouldn’t because i haven’t really even explained anything, haha. for some reason, i’m uncomfortable at the thought of having sex with someone because of of my anatomy, ze female sex organ. Vagina—pussy, whatever you call it. i imagine it in my mind and it’s all fine and dandy until i remember i have one. whoopdeedoo. and i know that it’s not just because i’m a virgin and haven’t had sex before, just like any other straight or gay person who’s uncomfortable at the thought of being with the same or opposite gender even when they might never have been with someone before. same thing with me, which then makes me wonder if i’m trans, which then makes me go “???” and then i don’t dwell on it again because i don’t have any answers.

ah yes, forgot to mention. whenever i think about being with a guy, i feel gay. really gay. super gay. uber fucking gay, even gayer then i don’t even feel at the thought of being with a girl. when i feel like being with a girl, it feels RIGHT. not saying that feeling gay a wrong—far from that, it just feels like everything’s right in the world. it makes me wonder if i’m more sexually and romantically attracted to guys and romantically towards girls. i know i said i haven’t been attracted to anyone yet, but i meant more of an actual person. i’m basing this off of an IDEA of a guy or a girl, however reliable that might be.

to finish this off quickly, i’m someone who doesn’t feel like the labels suit me well, they never quite well fit. but since i’m hyper aware of what i’m feeling, i always feel the need to identify it right away before dwelling on it long enough. another thing. i don’t care about pronouns. he, she, they—DONT CARE. if someone sees me as a guy, okay. as a girl? okay. as a...they? lol okay. i REALLY don’t care. the only thing that ticks me off is how people genderfy already existing terms to fit another gender like “dude.” it may be a personal thing but please, don’t call me dudette. it’s cringey. just call me dude. 

oooooone added thing, i’ve been homeschooled for a year now. not in touch with any friends as much anymore a CERTAINLY not in any contact with humans my age anymore...so i don’t know how i’m daring in terms of that. i can only rely on the occasional wattpad picture of gays and my heart will clench :’( *dramatically wipes tear*

Long story short-Yo so I randomly dumped the whole *I’m gay* on my mom. After a few silent minutes went past, she’d then realised I was serious... my mom got up and walked out of the room. Minutes later she come walking in with candles, The bible and what seems to be a Jesus cross while chanting *may the evil leave my poor baby’s souls so he may live a pure life as for told*. I’m just stoked that I remembered all this. "

"This is my first post on Reddit so I have no how this works. 

A little background, I am still young enough to not be able to drive a car. I have a girlfriend who is a couple of month younger so she can't either. We are both pan and I am genderfluid as well. We both live in a Christian home within the same church. And we are both in the closet still.

Anyway back to why I am posting this. I had a tornado hit nearby my town and after my family saw all the damage and when it got bad again, I freaked out. My mother who was forcing me to be with her and my brother wasn't helping at all and I am now dealing with emotions that came with all that just happened. On top of that my girlfriend can't come over. We maybe go to the same church but I am homeschooled, she is not and I live around 30 minutes from her town and she lives on the other side of it. 

Her parents watch everything she does on her phone and it shuts down at 9:15 at night never night. I don't know what to do and I need to get this out there somewhere. I have some people supporting me but it doesn't help with my problem with my girlfriend. We only see each other twice a week at church for 2 or fewer hours. 

What can we do in this situation?"

"Okay so, I’m a girl. I’m 16. I’ve always liked dudes and I have always dated them. But, I’ve always had this little feeling that I was also attracted to girls. Like, when I watch YouTube and stuff, I like to imagine myself with the different youtubers (I know it’s weird but I’m in the middle of a crisis leave me alone). Sure, the guys are cute, but I almost always imagine myself with the girls. It’s a very weird feeling. I’ve grown up in a Christian family who lives in Texas (which of course doesn’t make it better), and my parents have always taught me that being gay is weird and people shouldn’t be gay. They’re not like harsh or anything, they just don’t believe it’s right. Anyways, when I think of myself with these people, I image me living with them and stuff. Like, married and I kinda like it. But, if I image anything sexual, it just grosses me out. I really just associate sexy with guys. I’m so confused. Can y’all please help me figure this out? And could you tell me what to do after?"

the biggest problem that o can't fit into any labels is my lack of knowledge of sexual attraction. what does sexual attraction feel like ?? I mean Google says it's kind of attraction when you have a feeling that you want to sex with that person but I think it's than that because I don't think so I have ever experienced such a feeling where I want to have sex with someone. I mean does having butterflies in your stomach or blushing without the feeling of wanting have sex with a person counts as sexual attraction as well?? in simple words can y'all tell what do you experience when you are sexually attracted to anyone ???

So I'm bi sexual (and bi gender but I'm going to deal with that another day when I'm long outta the house) and my parents are hardcore Christian like shove a cross through your throat for cussing once type of hardcore and I have to come out to them because I have a boyfriend and they are beginning to suspect that im dating him and I'm worried about them finding out on their own and confronting me about it on their own terms and turf... Do y'all have any tips on how I can come out and not have them crucify me. I'm scared but want to bring it up before they do and force me to go to conversion therapy
"So I came out as bi but now I'm thinking I might be lesbian becausei don't feel any attraction to males, but still not a crazy amount for females. What do you think I would be?"
Hi I'm pansexual and I'm still in the closet I just got redit nice to meet you all
"So I came out to my parents a few months ago, my dad says I’m still too young but my mom, she completely doesn’t accept me. If me being part of the community gets brought up even in the slightest, you know she’s going to say something hurtful, mean, or something like. She’s the one person I was sure I could come out to and she’d accept me. It just hurts so much. Whenever I try to talk to her it turns into a huge argument. Help?.."
"Everyone thinks me and my bestfriend are dating but we are only joking and im afraid the guy i like wont ask me out cuz he thinks i am gay. 
 How do i tell him im not gay, without him getting the idea that i like him?  How do i bring up the conversation about me being gay? Got any advice for me? Want to help a fellow supporter of the Lgbtq+ community? (but not lgbtq+)

Thanks In advance! -msshittypizza

"So I was playing an online game the other day, and someone entered using the name ""schoolshooter"". I told them that they needed to change their name as the current one was pretty awful, and they told me i was a n****r faggot. I am a poc and a member of the lgbtq+ community, so I left. How should I deal with these kinds of people?"

So I’ve only come out to close friends as trans male and before I came out to anyone else I wanted to make sure this is what I wanted. So to do this I’ve let body hair grow out and I’ve been wearing “men’s products” and so far I’m loving this. I never hated my face and I’ve always had a a lot of femininity but I always hated the fact that I was female. I’m mostly here for like any advice or for someone to just tell me if I’m trans or not cuz like rn I’m in a pickle. 
"Friend: how gay are you

Me:*try’s to draw a straight line shows friend the drawing *

Friend: why did you draw a circle wait OHHHHHHH

Any trans or gender queer people out there who suffer from dysphoria when trying to shower? Like part of me wants to shower with the lights off but the other part of me is like “yo I won’t be able to the serial killer hiding behind my shower curtain”

"So im a girl, I want to be a guy, but I know that if I was a guy I’d definitely be gay. What do I do, and what would that make me? Sorry if this post doesn’t make much sense"
"I've recently been feeling very bad about myself in every way, but there's particularly one thing that has been bothering me for so long
I discovered I'm demisexual (and -romantic) a few years ago, and I've never told anyone irl. I'm very happy and secure with my friends and love them dearly, but I feel like none of them would ever understand. I feel like I'm hiding something from them and feel bad about that. Every time my friends talk about ""hot guys"" I always get uncomfortable and panic when they ask me what I think.
More recently, I've also had crushes on a few girls as well as a few boys and now know I'm bi too.
My friends have asked me if I'm straight or if I've ever liked a girl while I haven't been secure with my sexuality and I've told them I'm straight. I've felt like I'm betraying them. The last months or so, I've started to feel more safe and wanted to come out to them, and tried so many times. But we're going to different schools next semester.
I honestly don't know what to do because I hate hiding who I am. I can't tell my family - they would never understand. "
"Hey all, earlier this year my 12yo daughter told me she had a crush on another girl. Then recently she said that she feels like a boy. I get the sense that shes very confused and feels lonely. I had big challanges growing up and can relate to confusion, anxiety and angst of that age....but this is new territory for me. I would like to hear from youth/young adults about their journey to self truth, what their parents did (or wish they did) to help bring inner peace and understanding.
For background: she is an only child. Her father and I are married, educated, liberal and affectionate. Non religious. It's NOT about us accepting her..we do. I want to give her every tool for coping and accepting herself (himself?)  And there's a lot I don't know.
 So far i have been researching books and materials to educate myself as well as looking for appropriate support groups. I also found a counselor locally that specializes in LGBTQ youth and made an appt for her. "
"Hello, fellow human being.

First of all, this contains stories from my own life and my experiences. If you don't want to hear or read about them, then you can read something else. I'm just looking for someone who can relate to me and that I can talk to. I've been wanting to do this for a long time, but I've never really gotten around to it. But since it's pride month, and I just watched Love, Simon, I thought I would give it a shot.

I'm a sixteen year old girl who is quite unsure about my sexuality. Not that I'm uncertain as to how I feel - because I feel like I can identify as a bisexual demisexual (and -romantic, if that is relevant to you). I just feel like people wouldn't understand me. It's hard for me, because I have this strong inner will to say it out loud, and I think many other people in the lgbtq+ community can relate to this as well. The thing is, people around me would not understand me at all. I don't want to tell my family or my friends because they would never understand. I feel like I'm all alone on this, and it's very difficult. And now you are probably thinking to yourself ""but you have the community. Here, people understand you!"", and yes, you are correct, but I feel like my sexual and romantic orientation isn't truly in the lgbtq+, or I feel like other people think so. And I don't fit in outside there either. I keep going crazy about it. I think about it all the time, and i can't let it go. 

All my life I've kept quiet about this.
When someone has asked me ""you're straight, right?"" or something, I've just said that I am straight.
And even though I am young and not ready to come out right now, if ever, i just want to talk about it with someone. Someone who makes me feel like I'm not alone.

Thank you, for reading this. It was probably a huge mess. If you want to talk to me, because I need it and maybe you need it. Maybe it was a little cliché, but sometimes, things are.
Have a wonderful day
A wonderful week
A wonderful life"
I know this is an unpopular opinion but it must be said. ALL GAYS R GAY

"Being single isn't that easy. But the good part is that you don't need to stay into any commitments cause ""promises are meant to be broken"" and that sucks!! I am 100% introvert and the other day my close friend (a good persuading person) FORCES me to go into a disco party that is near my place and it's ""probably going to be my only opportunity in life"" according to him (bitch). And as a person who does not know how to say NO, did eventually go. My friend, let's just call him.... tweety, chose the outfit that I'm going to wear. At first it was quite uncomfortable cause of the black skinny jeans (first time wearing) and a maroon polo shirt or something I don't know much about fashion before so suck it! We finally reached to the said event and I admit that I actually liked it but about few minutes later,    this MOTHER FREAKING HANDSOME GUY who suddenly showed up between me and my friend who were party dancing just FREAKING complimented me saying my ass looks sooooo good!!!!! I WAS LIKE..... 👉👌


LOL no just kidding..... partly. But I definitely did not say anything sexually back. I just said ""hahaha thanks didn't notice it was like that before."" Not a great comeback, but at least he wasn't weirded out or something. We dance a little longer and then after that, he asked for my number and gave it to him and the next day... he never really texted me -.-        jerk
But I am really happy that I have something really wonderful to appreciate about myself ^.^ "
