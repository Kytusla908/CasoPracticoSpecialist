hey guys i kinda just wanna rant to someone i recently broke up with my bf im scared and im so mentally unstable idk how to live my life anymore everything i do reminds me of him i really loved him and he said he no longer did just like that i cant move or breath hes my whole world he blocked me on everything my life has no purpose anymore any advice other than my current cutting
the cdcs website really helped me maybe it can help you too
okay for a little backstory ive known im nonbinary for about years now ive been out to my parents for over a year when i came out i said i would like to use theythem pronouns they do really good at calling me my name but neglect my pronouns and when i try and ask my mother to use theythem she gets all defensive because she is certain i dont use them so i just stopped asking her because i dont want to get yelled at but its causing me really bad dysphoria and i dont know how to tell her does anyone have any tips about this
so im a lesbian ive been coming out for the past years what i mean by that is my mom is semi homophobic she doesnt likeagree with anyone not cis straight but she wont bully people about it and when i try to tell her that i dont like guys at all or that i like girls shell either completely ignore me or shell say that social media is pushing me to be that way and im not actually that way aka shes in complete denial about it so ive told her multiple times since every time i mention it though i feel super bad afterwards i feel like an idiot for saying it out loud im not ashamed at all to be in the lgbtq community i love the fact that im a lesbian so i dont know why i feel ashamed when i say it out loud has anyone else experienced this after coming out
i am bi but nobody knows it even im still really figuring it out but i really want to talk to someone about it but im terrified to tell anyone because all my family and friends are christians and i dont know who is going to be accepting of me my parents are really homophobic so i know i cant tell them not yet anyway but now i have to put up with their homophobic shit and i need someone to vent to but i cant tell anyone so i came here to vent thats all thank you for listening
hey so im and attempting to write a murder mystery story with a gay nonbinary main character as someone who isnt nonbinary i would love some guidance on this part im lesbian so ive got the gay part down
so like obviously ive been questioning ever since i was like eleven suggesting the fact that im probably not straight thats all i know though i probably like girls but i cant tell if i like guys or if thats just heteronormative tendencies speaking i was incredibly sheltered as a kid and didnt know gay people existed until i was ten so up until that point i just thought that i was going to marry a guy one day and thats it ive had to slowly warm up to what being gay meant and now i imagine relationships with girls just as much as relationships with guys its really confusing though cause when it comes to imagining sexual situations i only imagine men but when it comes to marriage and living the rest of my life i only imagine women am i imagining men in sexual situations because its the only thing ive been shown or am i imagining women in loving domestic situations cause men scare me i didnt grow up in all that great of a household its really confusing and its kinda stopped me from dating im seventeen i havent dated my entire life ive been trying to play it off cool by telling everyone that i just dont have time for it and that i like to be independent which has a certain truth to it but its also because im terrified sorry if this paragraph is hard to read im usually more eloquent but my minds scattered and im exhausted i might edit later so sentences make more sense if someone had a similar experience to mine itd be really helpful to hear how they figured things out thanks for reading
i just found who my crush is and i know that isnt a big deal but it is i am yo and ive known for the last two years that im gay and no one knows but the thing is that i didnt have a crush on anyone to the point in which i thought i was asexual which is not bad and i am not against it but i want to love someone and that someone to love me back but anyways i was rewatching a series of unfortunate events the series and i realized my crush is dylan kingwell portrays duncan quagmire he is too and perfect needless to say xb soooo there is him and no one cares so sorry to put you through this and have a good day everyone byeee
im new just came out to mom it went well it just went so i thought i would come here and try to cheer myself up if you want to talk or vent you can ill a safe place even if my home isntbut thats beside the point i want to reach out and find a welcoming community i think i found it and i want to be that for anyone who needs it i want it to be positive unlike mine hope i can help have a good day or night or whatever i hope your lives are well
so i recently identified as bi but i dont know any more i have only had romantic feelings for dude and the rest are girls i need help ive also had three similar romantic experiences with nonbinary people so am i pan help edit i am now identifying as a demi and omnisexual cis female
yall my mom just sat me down and asked me if i was gay help help help i said no i wasnt ready to come out but i still feel like im lying to herrrrr i mean technically im bi not gay but still i feel like im hiding a part of myself
so ive fknown himm before he even thought he was trans and weve been friend for years and i realized that i liked him two years ago we have kissed a couple times in the past and i kissed him even when he was dating someone and they are still dating and his significant other doesnt know he made the move twice and i did it the last time and he kissed me back and told me he liked me back but wants to keep his relationship with his significant other advice on getting over him
hii guys
hello lgbtq bitches anyways i was lookin to see if anyone finna dm me just bc not sure you want to i have lovely reasons im like antisocial so thisll b fun and if you just wanna vent i gotchu fam i have a lot of annoying facts like gay penguins steal straight penguins eggs so they can be dads they often trick the couple by taking the egg and replacing it with a rock even in zoos zookeepers have to give them eggs since they refuse to b straight the planet mercury is a symbol used by the transgendered community the sign for mercury is a crescent shape and a cross which represents the male and female principles in harmony in an individual which made the god mercury fathered hermaphroditus who had both male and female sex organs gay people tend to be lefthanded much more often than heterosexuals the entire species of the dwarf chimpanzee is bisexual lions have also exhibited homosexual behavior homosexual behavior has been observed in over animal species the worlds first prolgbt organization was found in in current germany they sought to repeal a law that criminalized sex between males amongst the people that signed their petition was albert einstein in dutch scientists discovered a potential natural occurring chemical found in potatoes which had the ability to change the sexual orientation of any animal which feeds off it swag is just an acronym from a group of gay guys in the s that stands for secretly we are gay yes all that and more
so i recently had a huge crush on a nonbinary person and i have had crushes on girl and guys but im not sure what sexuality that is i think its pan but im not sure
yea you read the title right kanye west is a transphobe now i have never liked him to begin with and since i saw some very transphobic things on his twitter i just hate his guts now so if any of yall trans folk have twitter you may want to check out what hes posted and report him like i did

""
so finally ive done it her name is katie and shes just as goofy and extra as i am
hi im really new to the lgbtq community and im still struggling to fully understand my sexuality i havent come out to my peers although they have been accepting towards lots of other queers i just feel like im not ready i have a crush on a girl in my music class and she totally gives me gay vibes shes never said anything about liking guys she dresses like a skater girl sometimes mixing it up with a few hoodies and she has short nails she compliments me sometimes and it totally makes my day but i have no clue how to talk to her i have her snapchat from a group chat were both in but i dont know how to start a real conversationnnnn shes super sweet but i just dont know if we have any common interests other than music and its difficult to start a random convo in the middle of class and one on the internet would be awkward i could really use some advice on how to talk to her i want to explore my sexuality and i really do like her thanks for reading my rant lol sorry it was long edit she complimented my new maddens and a few of my outfits and i said i really liked her style when we were at a class function we had to walk in a single file line and she tripped and bumped into me and obviously got kinda nervous and said sorry i just kinda laughed it off and said the purple streaks she had just gotten in her hair looked nice edit pt i honestly didnt realize i liked her for a long time i used to kinda hate her actually when i thought i was straight but i never made it obvious the feeling was almost like jealousy but then i realized it wasnt of her it was that i wasnt with her i had noticed myself staring at her and stuff and i had a few dreams about her and i just had no clue why until now
im les just wanted to say that im so fing happy

i need help i fucked up big time so a few weeks ago i made a discord server for my schools gsa and i made the roles puns about sexualitygender identity etc most of them where just stupid puns and harmless fun except one unknowingly as a result of my lack of education i made one of the roles super derogatory and bad now for the next part you need to know something first i have a lot of trouble in social situations as a result of me not having any friends like literally at all until i was about so i missed a lot of developmental social skills like knowing when a joke goes too far and picking up in inferences so my friend tried to subtly hint that what i said was offensive but obviously i didnt pick up on it so then i just went on with my day thinking everything was aok but then when we got in an argument on the bus they brought up the discord role and how it was offensive and it shocked me so much so i just kind of sat their and stared at the seat in front of me for the rest of the ride we eventually talked and they said that my page apology was useless and i said that they where right and i would try and educate myself then they said i was wrong and selfish witch is when the second problem arose i lashed out and yelled at them about how i spend most of my time talking one friend off of rooftops to stop him from killing himself talking another away from drugs and on the weekends helping disabled kids ski how can i help fix our friendship we used to be their for each other now they havent spoken to me in weeks ps if i referred to my friend as he not they its a mistake they recently came out as nonbianary and im still getting used to not calling them he

hi i am pretty new to reddit so feel free to direct me to a different subreddit where this would be more appropriate im a year old afab person who is currently very confused about their gender i dont experience any kind of discomfort with being called by any name or pronoun although i would prefer himhis i recently have gotten very uncomfortable with my long hair and really want to get a pixie haircut although my parents wont allow it i have lessened this to some extent by keeping my hair in a braid almost daily for a week now i am technically pansexual but due to trauma i only feel comfortable with people with a female bottomarea i do like my curvy bodytype and really adore pretty dresses however if i had the choice to choose my agab both my name body and pronouns i would without the blink of an eye pick to be a boy for some reason if i was amab i would actually wear boys clothing and not feel a need for dresses at all even though most of the wardrobe i have now is dresses or skirts i still to a lesser extent feel as though i should have a male bottom and not a female one ive noticed that wearing very feminine clothing makes me act a lot like a stereotypical cis woman relying on others to make choices for me is very helpless and very low selfesteem and confidence i am not at all like this on the inside its like im just acting like what i feel is expected of me today i tried on a boys jacket i felt way more me same when i wear jeans although i think boys clothing would allow me to let even more go of this weird behavior this is just a hypothesis though my parents are quite conservative so i am worried they might not be very supportive if i first claim to be one thing later to realize i am something else entirely so please if you think you might know what is up with me id really appreciate it thanks in advance kira

i feel butterflies in stomach i blush and feel tingles only when im around guys but when it comes around girls i imagine having sex with them or having romantic relationship with them but im confused as to on what bases can one assume who they are attracted to and whats their sexuality
i have sexual attractions towards other girls but im not sure if im just at that age where i start questioning my sexuality like i have kissed a girl and i liked it but i have also kissed boys and enjoyed it but i always find myself attracting towards girls when i see a pretty girl and a hot boy please help me
its been a good few years more than since ive been having thoughtsfeelings of being a girl but in the last month or its been getting so much stronger just to be clear i dont strongly hate my gender but i think i would rather be female has anyone else gone through this i have a female partner who says shes ok with it if i was to become a a girl i feel so much more comfortable in her clothes than male ones i really wish i could go out like it but my anxiety stops it but as i said i dont strongly hate my gender as i currently am but i have questions has anyone else been through this and had hrt and not regretted it does this make me transgender i really do want to go on hrt and i kind of want for you to say yes to help me confirm this as all above how hard would it be to get prescribed hormones considering i said that i dont exactly hate my gender thanks all
ok so i have a confession and its killing me and i really need some advice ok so here it is sooooooo ithinkimightbebi ok a little bit slower now ok deep breath so i think i might be bi but heres the thing my parents arent to keen on the lgbtq community and i dont want to come out to them until im legally an adult i know my friends will except me and all but i still try and deny it and every time i deny it theres this little voice in the back of my head that says its true i just need advice
ello as you can see by my username th grader here not relevant whatsoever except to add that im a yo female whos probably genderfluid maybe idk lol just gonna talk about how im feeling about my sexuality and gender identity i guess p sometimes i feel like i should have a penis between my legs it doesnt have to do with my personality whether or not i have one that describes a person who generally has manly man that exudes strong bursts of masculine energy talking about stereotypes about men and how there are people who think that people who look and act this way should have ze dick between their legs but then the times where i actually go to take a shower i realize i have a body wow i havent seen this thing in ages bruh why did i think about chopping off these lumps and my hips why did i think about hormoning them away haha im exaggerating though i dont hate the fact that i have boobs and wide hips i like the way i look love it actually i guess im confident thought its only boosted by the fact i like my own body not by what people might have told me i dont remember lol but sometimes i want to feel more masculine i feel more masculine i had an epiphany a month back where i was writing a cisgirl for once ive always felt more comfortable writing guys and if i were writing a girl theyd be a projection of myself so it didnt feel uncomfortable or any different and after about k words i read back thought about what to write next and was stumpedhow do i write a girl whawait but i am one uhkinda i guess totally didnt know what to write im still gonna continue that storyi cant change her sex or anything because its supposed to be a les story so i cant make excuses and with sexuality i can say that im pan ah yes the curvature of achingly cold metal that sends shivers down my spine at the sight of it my lips glistening and red as i stare impatiently at the sadly impotent and still laying piece of metal on my kitchen stove black grease covered its expanses with a layer of charred salmon skin lying upon it i sighed i was too lazy to take the pan out to a date to the sink better luck next time or maybe demi in my whole life ive never really had a crush and i dont really know what its like to be attracted to people i probably have been attracted to someone before but im ultra aware of my feelings so maybe not base control center reporting copy report base signal was detected on our radar copy specify signal base signal detected wasah yes a t t r a c t i o n weve done it lieutenant send report up to the main console this is so fucking random im sorry to whoever reads this lol just a person who writes a lot i can say that i mightve had a crush but i really dont think so th grade in math a girl sat in front of me dark brown short hair that went to her shoulder paleish skin but anyone could tell that she had a little mexican in her blood unless they were blind metaphorically and literally big eyes long eyelashes and thin lips she was pretty as uncrushily i could say it one day she confessed to me in the middle of class like just talking to me during work and would tease me sometimes by randomly saying if we should go out or something mind you i was it was also a year ago but i wasnt comfortable at the idea of dating at that age even when a lot of other kids were doing it too young ya know still too young now but dont really give a shit right nowanyway i was incredibly nervous she gave me a note before class ended and instantly i pointed out all of the spelling mistakes but my heart pounded and i was nervous around her my best friend at the time still friends with them will explain later said that whenever i talked about them my cheeks would go all red and stuff but in the end i gave her a note before the end of class that was a fuck load of scrambledeefuck that i didnt realize until the next day and i knew because i didnt remember any of the shit i wrote and i remember going off topic a lot just know that my note ran along the lines off sorry i dont want to lead you along i wanted to become friends though i didnt know her much i wanted to get to know her a bit more and maybe become friends who knows maybe well grow closer and build something over time that leads into something else i left my phone number on the note hoping shed text or something never did whole thing blows over and its getting closer to summer may probably dont remember and i started to approach her covert glances during math whenever wed have games during pe which were rare but wed either play capture the flag or soccer the class is split into teams where we wore these knitted colored jerseys i would chase her i was super awkward around her super shy one time during a day when we played soccer im not athletic at all please kill me when im outside under the fucking sun during summer forced out of my will i would just sit on the grass on the border of the invisible perimeters and if she was from my team or the others sometimes shed go sit with her friends by me or if she came from the neighboring field suuuuuuper awkward she asks me about random questions whats your favorite pet and stuff like that the weekend comes friday i can feel the glow of nervousness and butterflies at the thought of her saturday i can still feel it the acid bubble in my stomach not the deadly kind lol but sunday it faded i was depressed at the time and that day was a really dark one im a very apathetic person and looking back i feel like the depression was something that grew because of my own apatheticness i felt very empty cold muted everything was in black and white and nothing was ever warm colored the crush cooled down completely at the time i called it the day crush because those last few events happened over days never really took notice of her again and her hellos to me down the hallway decreased looking back i never felt attracted to her she was pretty cute but i never felt attraction really it makes me wonder if feelings rubbed off or if im demisexual dont know yetbecause first i have to actually have romantic feelings for someone and that hasnt happened yet so right now im sticking with my cold metally pans im not uncomfortable at the thought of being with a guy or girl kissing them making out with them or having sex with themoh wait that last one yesbut also no if you remember im female which means that with whomever im with in the future romantically sexually or both means id be having sex with them dont get the picture yet yeah you wouldnt because i havent really even explained anything haha for some reason im uncomfortable at the thought of having sex with someone because of of my anatomy ze female sex organ vaginapussy whatever you call it i imagine it in my mind and its all fine and dandy until i remember i have one whoopdeedoo and i know that its not just because im a virgin and havent had sex before just like any other straight or gay person whos uncomfortable at the thought of being with the same or opposite gender even when they might never have been with someone before same thing with me which then makes me wonder if im trans which then makes me go and then i dont dwell on it again because i dont have any answers ah yes forgot to mention whenever i think about being with a guy i feel gay really gay super gay uber fucking gay even gayer then i dont even feel at the thought of being with a girl when i feel like being with a girl it feels right not saying that feeling gay a wrongfar from that it just feels like everythings right in the world it makes me wonder if im more sexually and romantically attracted to guys and romantically towards girls i know i said i havent been attracted to anyone yet but i meant more of an actual person im basing this off of an idea of a guy or a girl however reliable that might be to finish this off quickly im someone who doesnt feel like the labels suit me well they never quite well fit but since im hyper aware of what im feeling i always feel the need to identify it right away before dwelling on it long enough another thing i dont care about pronouns he she theydont care if someone sees me as a guy okay as a girl okay as athey lol okay i really dont care the only thing that ticks me off is how people genderfy already existing terms to fit another gender like dude it may be a personal thing but please dont call me dudette its cringey just call me dude oooooone added thing ive been homeschooled for a year now not in touch with any friends as much anymore a certainly not in any contact with humans my age anymoreso i dont know how im daring in terms of that i can only rely on the occasional wattpad picture of gays and my heart will clench dramatically wipes tear peace

ive recently been feeling very bad about myself in every way but theres particularly one thing that has been bothering me for so long i discovered im demisexual and romantic a few years ago and ive never told anyone irl im very happy and secure with my friends and love them dearly but i feel like none of them would ever understand i feel like im hiding something from them and feel bad about that every time my friends talk about hot guys i always get uncomfortable and panic when they ask me what i think more recently ive also had crushes on a few girls as well as a few boys and now know im bi too my friends have asked me if im straight or if ive ever liked a girl while i havent been secure with my sexuality and ive told them im straight ive felt like im betraying them the last months or so ive started to feel more safe and wanted to come out to them and tried so many times but were going to different schools next semester i honestly dont know what to do because i hate hiding who i am i cant tell my family they would never understand
hey all earlier this year my yo daughter told me she had a crush on another girl then recently she said that she feels like a boy i get the sense that shes very confused and feels lonely i had big challanges growing up and can relate to confusion anxiety and angst of that agebut this is new territory for me i would like to hear from youthyoung adults about their journey to self truth what their parents did or wish they did to help bring inner peace and understanding for background she is an only child her father and i are married educated liberal and affectionate non religious its not about us accepting herwe do i want to give her every tool for coping and accepting herself himself and theres a lot i dont know so far i have been researching books and materials to educate myself as well as looking for appropriate support groups i also found a counselor locally that specializes in lgbtq youth and made an appt for her
hello fellow human being first of all this contains stories from my own life and my experiences if you dont want to hear or read about them then you can read something else im just looking for someone who can relate to me and that i can talk to ive been wanting to do this for a long time but ive never really gotten around to it but since its pride month and i just watched love simon i thought i would give it a shot im a sixteen year old girl who is quite unsure about my sexuality not that im uncertain as to how i feel because i feel like i can identify as a bisexual demisexual and romantic if that is relevant to you i just feel like people wouldnt understand me its hard for me because i have this strong inner will to say it out loud and i think many other people in the lgbtq community can relate to this as well the thing is people around me would not understand me at all i dont want to tell my family or my friends because they would never understand i feel like im all alone on this and its very difficult and now you are probably thinking to yourself but you have the community here people understand you and yes you are correct but i feel like my sexual and romantic orientation isnt truly in the lgbtq or i feel like other people think so and i dont fit in outside there either i keep going crazy about it i think about it all the time and i cant let it go all my life ive kept quiet about this when someone has asked me youre straight right or something ive just said that i am straight and even though i am young and not ready to come out right now if ever i just want to talk about it with someone someone who makes me feel like im not alone thank you for reading this it was probably a huge mess if you want to talk to me because i need it and maybe you need it maybe it was a little clich but sometimes things are have a wonderful day a wonderful week a wonderful life
i know this is an unpopular opinion but it must be said all gays r gay

being single isnt that easy but the good part is that you dont need to stay into any commitments cause promises are meant to be broken and that sucks i am introvert and the other day my close friend a good persuading person forces me to go into a disco party that is near my place and its probably going to be my only opportunity in life according to him bitch and as a person who does not know how to say no did eventually go my friend lets just call him tweety chose the outfit that im going to wear at first it was quite uncomfortable cause of the black skinny jeans first time wearing and a maroon polo shirt or something i dont know much about fashion before so suck it we finally reached to the said event and i admit that i actually liked it but about few minutes later this mother freaking handsome guy who suddenly showed up between me and my friend who were party dancing just freaking complimented me saying my ass looks sooooo good i was like lol no just kidding partly but i definitely did not say anything sexually back i just said hahaha thanks didnt notice it was like that before not a great comeback but at least he wasnt weirded out or something we dance a little longer and then after that he asked for my number and gave it to him and the next day he never really texted me jerk but i am really happy that i have something really wonderful to appreciate about myself
